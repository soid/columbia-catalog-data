In addition to the opening inquiry, guiding questions for this course include but are not limited to the following. What kinds of state-sanctioned backlash in France have ensued in the face of affirmative reclamations of blackness (e.g. N\u00e9gritude and Afrof\u00e9minisme)? \u00a0And, what are the historical linkages between Black radicalism in France and the United States? Through an intra-imperial and inter-imperial lens, this course will center contributions from Black writers, artists, and intellectuals of divergent colonial histories with especial consideration to those for whom French and France is their native language and land.",

We will examine how Shange's nonfiction contributes to her broader work and her perspectives on history, gender, feminism, and race as they intersect in her life as a Black woman artist. Students will develop critical thinking skills through close reading, analysis, and discussion of Shange's nonfiction and will improve their writing skills by composing reflections and essays on Shange's works. They will develop research skills and gain insights into Shange's creative process through firsthand engagement with Shange's archive at Barnard.",

Black scholars have long recognized the complex\u00a0spatialities of Black life, developing theories of diaspora, racial capitalism, and anti-\/post-colonialism that are inherently geographical. In this course, we will think about space, place, landscape, and ecology through a Black geographic framework, paying attention to how scholars, activists, and artists engage the poetics and materiality of Black life to explore ideas about repair, inequality, resistance, and liberation. The questions that animate this course are: what are Black geographies? What is the future of Black geographies outside of academia? How can centering a \u201cBlack sense of place\u201d in turn transform the way we think about space,\u00a0place, and power? How does Black Studies account for and understand Black spatial condition, experience, and imaginaries?\n  \nThe course will begin with an engagement of key works on Black geographies. We will come to see institutional Black geographies as concerned with the Black spatial imaginaries formed in the aftermath of enslavement and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. As such, our readings will center experiences in the United States. We will cover such topics as Black method(s), racial capitalism, regional geographies, carceral geographies, and Black home and infrastructure.\n  \nUltimately, students will be introduced to central themes, concepts and approaches that highlight the spatialization of race and the racialization of space through various technologies that signify places according to new rules of inclusion and exclusion. In this way, we will examine historical and contemporary macro-community and micro- sub-community (e.g., neighborhood) issues shaping the social, economic and political lives of Black people.",

Artist, often activists, explored the dissemination of information, and they commandeered messaging. Many of these artists positioned their output against mainstream media, while other artists seized existing media streams with the aim, optimistically, to alter them. Case studies include Stan VanDerBeek, Dara Birnbaum, Black Audio Collective, Tiffany Sia, Sondra Perry, and CAMP.\u00a0 This course brings together seminar discussions, the practice of making, and the hosting of practitioners; it is designed to offer students an introduction to various aspects of media as it is crafted and curated within and without museum environments.",

In no area is the uncertainty regarding near and long term effects as pronounced as in the question of how climate change will affect global migration. This course will address the issue of climate migration in four ways. First, the course will examine the theoretical and empirical literatures that have elucidated the nature of international migration in general. Second, the course will consider the phenomena of anthropogenic climate change as it relates to migration. Third, the course will consider how human rights and other legal regimes do or do not address the humanitarian issues created by anthropogenic climate change. Fourth, the course will synthesize these topics by considering how migration and climate change has arisen as a humanitarian, political, and economic issue in the Pacific. Human Rights elective.",

    "course_descr":"What can we learn from anthropological and ethnographic research in and about a damaged world, a world confronted by the violence and effects of war, climate change, transnational migration, post-industrial abandonment, and the lives and afterlives of colonialism and slavery? What are the ethnographic debates that address the catastrophes produced by capitalism and the lifeforms that emerge out of its ruins? What types of anthropological critique emerge in times enunciated as \u2018the end of the world\u2019? And what comes after this end? Ethnographies at the End of the World addresses these questions by paying close attention to some of the most relevant debates in contemporary anthropological theory and anthropological critique. These debates include, among others, discussions on violence and trauma, the politics of life and death, the work of memory and oblivion, and the material entanglements between human and non-human forms of existence. The aim of this seminar is to generate a discussion around the multiple implications of these theoretical arrangements and how anthropologists deploy them in their ethnographic understandings of the world we live in. In doing so, this course provides students with a fundamental understanding and conceptual knowledge about how anthropologists use and produce theory, and how this theoretical production is mobilized as a social critique. This course is reading intensive and operates in the form of a seminar. It is intended, primarily, for MA students in the department of anthropology and graduate students in other departments.",

Through the study of museum exhibitions, this course explores a series of debates about the representation of culture in museums, the politics of identity, and the significance of objects. We will consider the museum as a contemporary and variable form, as a site for the expression of national, group, and individual identity and as a site of performance and consumption. We will consider how exhibits are developed, what they aim to convey, what makes them effective (or not), and how they sometimes become flashpoints of controversy. Because the work of museums is visual, enacted through the display of material forms, we will also consider the transformation of objects into artifacts and as part of exhibitions, addressing questions of meaning, ownership, value, and magic. We will look at this range of issues from the point of view of practitioners, critics, and audiences. G6365 works in tandem with the exhibition project that will be developed in \u201cExhibition Practice in Global Culture\u201d to produce a small exhibit at AMNH.",

Silence, noise, voice, chambers, reverberation, sound in its myriad manifestations and transmissions.\u00a0 From the captured souls of Edison\u2019s phonography, to everyday acoustical adventures, the course turns away from the screen and dominant epistemologies of the visual for an extended moment, and does so in pursuit of sonorous objects.\u00a0 How is it that sound so moves us as we move within its world, and who or what then might the listening subject be?",

    "course_descr":"Prerequisites: The instructors permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate\/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages). The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis\/ capstone project.

    "course_descr":"Urbanization is inherently unequal, inscribing social, economic, environmental, and political unevenness into the spatial fabric of the city. But the distribution of such inequality is not inevitable. Urbanization is a product of the collective decisions we make (or choose not to make) in response to the shared challenges we face in our cities. And, thus, the patterns of urbanization can be changed. This is the task of urban planning and the starting point for this advanced seminar, which asks how we can reshape our cities to be more just\u2014to alleviate inequality rather than compound it. In embarking on this effort, we face numerous \u201cwicked\u201d problems without clear-cut solutions. The approaches one takes in addressing urban inequality are therefore fundamentally normative\u2014they are shaped by one\u2019s place in the world and one\u2019s view of it. The central challenge in addressing inequality is thus establishing a basis for collective action amongst diverse actors with differing\u2014and sometimes conflicting\u2014values and views. In other words, planning the just city a matter of both empathy and debate. In this course, we will endeavor to develop informed positions that can help us engage with others as a basis for taking collective action.\n  \nThe course is organized into four 3-week modules, each of which addresses a dimension of the just city: equity, democracy, diversity, and sustainability. In the first week of each module, we will discuss how the issue has been understood in history and theory (with an emphasis on tradeoffs between different priorities and values); in the second week, we will apply this discussion to a global case study prepared and presented by a team of students; and in the third week, we will hold an in-class debate to determine what should be done. Specific case studies vary each year.",

The class looks at changing attitudes to the natural world from the eighteenth century to the present, tracing important historical shifts in the consideration of nature across the\u00a0ecological\u00a0sciences, conservation practices,\u00a0landscape\u00a0design, and environmental activism, law and policy. Lectures focus on the critical role that artists and architects have played, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental degradation and in developing new means of mitigating anthropogenic\u00a0ecological\u00a0change.\n  \nCity,\u00a0Landscape,\u00a0Ecology\u00a0\nis divided into three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of\u00a0\nlandscape\n: picturesque garden theory, notions of \u201cwilderness\u201d as epitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern and Postmodern garden practices, and place of\u00a0landscape\u00a0in the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose here is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays in the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and technologies of power. Lectures in this part are shaped around a dialectical pair of historical episodes\u2013\u2013 for example, the picturesque garden is paired with the enclosure of the commons, and American national parks are discussed in relation to the systematic removal of native peoples.\n  \nWe then turn to\u00a0\necology\n\u00a0and related issues of climate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look at the rise of\u00a0ecological\u00a0thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the environment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of the era. In the session \u201cCapitalism, Race and Population Growth\u201d we examine the history of the \u201ccrisis\u201d of scarcity from Thomas Robert Malthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (\nThe Population Bomb\n, 1968) to today and look at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity.\u00a0\n  \nThe course concludes with Part III on\u00a0\nEnvironmental Repair\n.

Our emphasis will be on primary texts from each tradition, with introductory and interpretive secondary sources brought in as supplementary. \u00a0These primary sources will be discussed in class, but especially in required section meetings. \u00a0A sub-theme of the course is the \u201cpastoral\u201d dimension of answers to the Problem of Evil: to what extent are the answers we study comforting? \u00a0This course has been created with the many crises presently afflicting our world \u2013 COVID-19, climate change, and the injustice of racism, to name a few \u2013 in mind.",

Apply statistical programming techniques to model biological systems\n  \n6. Generate and interpret diverse plots based on biological datasets\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nCourse overview:\u00a0\n  \nOnce a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.",

We will start with the emergence of sustainable investment in the 1970s as it congealed strands of community organizing, consumer society, institutional activism from community organizing, labor activism, and institutional investor assertion into a new set of specific institutions and practices; continue through the shareholder activism and professionalization of the field in the 1980s and 1990; turn to the substantial growth and mainstreaming of the field from 2000s; and finally bring our history up to the present moment of policymaking, backlash, and self-doubt in the field. We will ask questions like: what did practitioners and advocates hope to achieve by building the field of sustainable investment? What kinds of work, in what kinds of institutions, made up the field? What are the political and ideological contexts in which the field emerged, and how have they changed over time? Why did something seen as so marginal back become so much more central to how we talk about finance and financial policy now? What does this history tells us about the (potential) utility of sustainable investment?",

    "course_descr":"The field of responsible investment has grown rapidly over the last twenty years, with the climate crisis serving as the paradigmatic ESG issue for investors. In the private sector, investors pledge to decarbonize their portfolios, ask for carbon reporting to manage that task, join together to engage corporations on their transition plans. As activity has grown, questions about the effectiveness and limitations of climate finance approaches to the climate crisis have grown along with them. A narrow focus on decarbonization has begun to give way to broader considerations of the transition and the risks and opportunities it poses for affected workers and communities, on the belief that social cohesion is a precondition for successful transition.\u00a0Private sector initiatives have been complemented with public policy and public investment efforts to shape environmental, social, and economic outcomes. Climate finance is in a moment of reflection, change, and doubt.\n  \nThis course will survey and analyze the ways that public and private investment are being or could be directed in support of a Just Transition (i.e., a low-carbon transition that does not worsen social inequalities), and various ways to think about how effective climate finance can be. We will look at investors\u2019 approaches to the decarbonization of the economy in political and social context, asking: how do or should investors integrate concerns for workers, communities, and environment into climate finance? what kinds of public policies are needed to ensure that investment points towards a Just Transition?\u00a0The result, we hope, will lead both to a better understanding of the roles public and private investment in a\u00a0Just Transition, climate policy, and an expanded critical capacity to analyze how well it\u2019s working.",

Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and\/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ. In our discussions and investigations this semester we will learn a great deal about Northeast Africa in antiquity \u2013 but, so too, about ethnicity, concepts of race, and power throughout the ancient Mediterranean.",

    "course_descr":"In little more than fifty years linguistics has shifted from philological description to a cognitive-biological quest to uncover the mind\u2019s language faculty. This seminar traces that shift through the generative tradition, which treats language as an innate \u201cmental organ\u201d whose universal grammar lets children build a full syntax from sparse input. We follow Minimalism\u2019s bold reduction: a single operation called Merge, plus a finite lexicon and two interfaces, one to articulation and one to thought, yields the \u201cdigital infinity\u201d of human expression. Framing this architecture in evolutionary terms, we confront Darwin\u2019s problem: did language emerge gradually for communication or erupt suddenly from pre-existing cognitive parts? Evidence from birdsong, primate calls, and gesture helps separate general performance limits from the species-specific competence that remains uniquely human. Students will practice minimalist analyses and weigh competing biolinguistic accounts, using language as a window onto the design and origin of the human mind.",

    "course_descr":"We make decisions countless times a day. Computational models have been developed that improve our understanding of how these decisions are made. This course is organized in three parts: perceptual decision-making, value-based decision-making, and computational psychiatry. In part one, perceptual decision-making, we will focus on computational models that can capture and explain decisions in perception, such as categorizing an orientation, or discriminating the direction of moving dots, or estimating the magnitude of a stimulus (e.g., time). We will start by laying the foundations of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference under uncertainty and build to models that incorporate confidence ratings and reaction times. In part two, value-based decision-making, we will move on to decisions that incorporate our values (e.g., \u2018Should I go out or stay in and study?\u2019, \u2018Should I eat a burger or a salad?\u2019). We will learn the basics of a computational modeling framework that captures how we learn values from rewards and punishments, reinforcement learning, as well as about model-free and model-based learning. Lastly, we will learn how impairments in decision-making that occur in psychopathology (e.g., addiction, anorexia nervosa, anxiety) have been conceptualized and quantified in the relatively new field of computational psychiatry.",

What ethical questions does translation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated? What is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation teach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will include selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary translations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and memoir.

This took various forms. From early moments of easy-going and confident cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to later author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines between west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern phenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation, for bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq\u2014the man credited with being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great translator\u2014called \u2018disjunction\u2019. We will begin with his satirical, deeply inventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a book with an insatiable appetite for definitions and comparisons, with Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an abiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges) and with locating and often subverting moments of connection and disconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present, where we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic, from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine. We will read them chronologically, starting with Leg Over Leg (1855) and finishing with Minor Detail, a novel that was only published last year.\u00a0 Obviously, this does not claim to be a comprehensive survey; for that we would need several years and even then, we would fall short.

These staggering numbers are fueled by drivers such as conflicts and political instability, climate change, disease outbreaks, poverty, and natural hazards. Together, these drivers have deepened pre-existing vulnerabilities, resulting in unprecedented need. They have also prompted humanitarians to address the accountability challenges and inequities deeply seated within the aid system.\n  \nHumanitarian agencies strive to meet rising needs, but the task that confronts them is immense.\u00a0\nFunding\n\u00a0for humanitarian responses is not keeping pace with requirements: although donors contribute more, the amounts are not commensurate with needs. Beyond financing, donor policies and politics challenge agencies' ability to deliver. The safety and security of aid workers is increasingly under threat.\n  \nThis course focuses on the management of humanitarian operations and intends to provide students with the opportunity to explore critical issues in the humanitarian system. It helps students understand debates in the humanitarian system, develop a framework of analysis they can use in headquarters and the field, and acquire a toolkit to help them succeed as aid workers. This practical course will interest those wishing to work with an aid agency, directly or indirectly with disaster-affected populations, or those who want to better understand the system and the opportunities and challenges that humanitarians face.",

    "course_descr":"Gender equality, and the empowerment of women and girls, are now widely accepted as development goals in their own right and as essential to inclusive and sustainable development. Yet despite progress in many areas, gender gaps and discrimination persist. This course asks: How did gender equality move from the periphery to the center of development discourse, and what difference has this shift made? Is gender equality a human right, an essential dimension of human development, or \u201csmart economics\u201d? What are the implications of a gender equality agenda for men and boys, and for broader understandings of gender identities and sexualities? What policies, strategies, and practices have been effective\u2014or ineffective\u2014in narrowing gender gaps and improving outcomes for both women and men in different development settings? What are possible responses to the \u201cgender backlash\u201d emerging in some countries and institutions?\n  \nIn this course, we approach gender, politics, and development through theory, policy, and practice. We explore multiple constructions of gender in development discourse; the intersection of gender with race, ethnicity, caste, class, sexual orientation, disability, and other social categories; and the influence of dominant economic and political trends. We examine how gender norms shape the approaches of governments, development agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.\n  \nA critical gender lens is applied to a wide range of development sectors and issues, including economic development, political participation, education and health, environment and climate change, and conflict and displacement. The course also considers current debates and approaches related to gender mainstreaming and gender metrics in development practice.

Our first class will provide a brief historical perspective of the global food system, highlighting relevant developments over the past 10,000 years and will explain key concepts, critical challenges, and opportunities ahead. For the ensuing few weeks, we will cover the core biophysical requirements for food production: soil and land, water and climate, and genetic resources. We include an introduction to human nutrition \u2013\u00a0\nNutrition Week\n\u00a0\u2013 that focuses on dietary change and food-based solutions to malnutrition. Building on this, the course will survey a selection of important food systems and trends across Asia, Africa, and Latin America that provide food security and livelihoods for more than half of the world\u2019s population. Case studies and classroom debates throughout the course will explore the roles of science, technology, policies, politics, institutions, business, finance, aid, trade, and human behavior in advancing sustainable agriculture, and achieving food and nutritional security. We will probe the interactions of food systems with global issues including poverty and inequality, the persistence of chronic hunger and malnutrition, climate change, environmental degradation, international food business and value chains, biotechnology (GMOs), post-harvest losses, and food waste. With a sharp eye for credible evidence, we will confront controversies, reflect on historical trends, identify common myths, and surface little-known but important truths about agriculture and food systems. In our final sessions, we address the ultimate question: can we feed and nourish the world without wrecking it for future generations?",

Rather than taking a content-specific approach where we might study different forms of educational policy, such as language policy, school choice, and special education, I have designed the course to think collectively and deeply about the long-arc of injustice, inequity, possibility, and resistance from historical redlining to the climate\/covid crisis as well as the actors who create, revise, and sustain educational policy in formal and informal educational spaces. As we do this, we will be asking you to think about a particular content area and how we might reimagine the policies in this area as we face the multipronged crisis of a planet that is burning amidst a global pandemic. While much of the reading is centered in the United States, we encourage you to think broadly about the global impact that educational policy has on the lives of educators, families, and youth and how these policies have the power to both replicate and dismantle inequities in our world.\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nLearning Objectives\n  \n  \nStudents will understand how to critique and use both qualitative and quantitative methods in policy research and policy writing.\n  \nStudents will be able to assess the strengths and limitations of different media sources, policy reports, academic scholarship, journalism articles, opinion pieces, documentary films, etc. and think critically about the media that they want to employ in their final project.\n  \nStudents will generate a policy brief that outlines a policy problem and generates a research-based solution.",

    "course_descr":"Education is a social project of making futures. It is a field where people imagine selves and worlds to come\n while navigating current constraints and past legacies. Even in the face of various crises that disrupt\n educational systems globally, education is often understood as a crisis response and charged with the task of\n forging alternative futures and driving social and economic progress.\n In this course, we will interrogate the politics of crisis and futurity in education. First, we will explore how\n notions of crisis are mobilized to define problems and solutions in education research and policy. In this\n exploration, we will ask how histories and politics of domination along lines of race, class, gender, and other\n social categories are articulated or silenced in discourses of educational crisis. We will attend to how crises\n create both danger and opportunity by considering how they serve to justify violent, dispossessive restructuring\n and how they lay bare structures of inequality in ways that generate collective action and transformation.\n Next, we will Interrogate education\u2019s futural orientations. We will probe familiar progress narratives and explore\n what roles education plays in shaping how marginalized communities imagine and enact futures beyond the\n status quo, attending to both its affordances and limitations. Throughout the course, we will draw on\n speculative fiction and on scholarship in anthropology, Black studies, and comparative education to investigate\n the politics of crisis and futurity in diverse educational contexts. We will engage study as speculative practice\n through collaborative and independent exercises that invite us to develop praxes for just futures of education.",

Through formal analysis of texts and the application of various theories presented in class, we\u2019ll begin to understand how Blackness moves through genre to understand its relationship to the world and in some cases, to the artform itself. We will look at various texts: Film, Television, Prose, and Music. By looking across genres, we will be able to honor the inherent intertextuality of Black work and the constant inter-discursive work done across genre, text, and time. Whether a critique of structural anti-Blackness writ large, an expression of the complexity of the positionality of Black persons, or a statement of the function of Blackness, these texts make a case for the theoretical rigor and provocative discourses that lies at the heart of Black Speculative Fiction.",

In this class, we will read ghost stories from the 17th century through the present day; in the process, we will examine what these stories reveal about our own preoccupations, fears, and desires. Writers and readers turn to ghost stories for horror and suspense, for sure, but also because they\u2019re a powerful medium for reckoning with history and memory\u2014with the past\u2019s hold over the present\u2014particularly when it comes to violence, loss, oppression, and trauma. Ghost stories engage with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; with social otherness; with marginalization. Ghost stories stage problems of justice, vengeance, and guilt. Ghost stories trouble the nature of the body, and the meaning of (and boundaries between) life and death. Ghost stories lend themselves both to fear and to laughter, both to questions and to answers. While exploring all of these topics and themes, we will also consider the trope of storytelling itself, which figures prominently in so many works of the genre. What is wrapped up in the gesture of telling a story, and in the ways, contexts, and reasons in and for which these stories get told? Readings (subject to change) include works by Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Edith Wharton, Henry James, Shirley Jackson, Helen Oyeyemi, Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, Oscar Wilde, and others.",

It is really important to bring diverse groups of students and future leaders into the development of AI.\u201d\u00a0 \n--\nFei-Fei Li, Professor, Denning Co-Director Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI\n  \nIncreasing numbers of AI experts and researchers emphasize the urgent need for college students to develop AI literacy, preparing them for evolving job markets, fostering ethical awareness, and ensuring equitable participation in an AI-driven society. To help them achieve AI literacy, this introductory-level course teaches students how to ethically and effectively use Generative AI (GAI) by exploring how GAI works, how to use it properly, and how to critically evaluate its output. Students will understand AI model functionality, distinguish GAI from traditional AI, examine issues of originality, authorship, intellectual property, copyright, plagiarism, fair use, accuracy, bias, environmental impacts, and privacy - all while developing meta-awareness about how AI simulates certain aspects of human creativity and cognition The course's placement in Barnard's English Department reflects the recognition that AI's development requires interdisciplinary perspectives beyond STEM, as AI research increasingly intersects with humanities and social sciences to address ethical, social, and cultural implications. Through ethics-focused assignments and writing projects culminating in a final research investigation in students' chosen fields, this course empowers students to resist pure AI reliance and actively control these technologies rather than remaining passive observers of AI's expanding influence in academia and society.",

The workshop will emphasize experimentation, encouraging students to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling by playing with form, language, and perspective.

Discussions will cover the mechanics of storytelling on a compressed scale, including structure, character development, point of view, dialogue, and style. Authors will include Cheever, Couto, Hempel, Davis, and Wang, and through these readings, students will explore the structural possibilities of the short form, the role of voice, and the ways in which brevity can intensify narrative impact. The class will examine how compression, omission, and implication create resonance in fiction.Each student will write and workshop three original short pieces, receiving detailed feedback from peers and the instructor.

The workshop will emphasize experimentation, encouraging students to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling by playing with form, language, and perspective. Readings will include works originally written in English as well as those in translation, offering a broad view of global approaches to flash fiction. Discussions will cover the mechanics of storytelling on a compressed scale, including structure, character development, point of view, dialogue, and style. Authors will include Cheever, Couto, Hempel, Davis, and Wang, and through these readings, students will explore the structural possibilities of the short form, the role of voice, and the ways in which brevity can intensify narrative impact. The class will examine how compression, omission, and implication create resonance in fiction.Each student will write and workshop three original short pieces, receiving detailed feedback from peers and the instructor. The goal is to develop a keen sense of how the economy of language can create depth and complexity in fiction.\n  \nSection 2 (taught by Idra Novey):\n\u00a0\nOld Wolves and New Grandmothers.\u00a0\nOnce upon a time there was a fiction workshop and each student in the workshop conjured a new role for the animal in their grandmother\u2019s bed. In this workshop, we\u2019ll experiment with how the tone and iconic figures of fairy tales may provide a way into a new work of fiction, though not necessarily a way out. We\u2019ll talk about myriad ways to subvert the expected meaning of the wolf and the wicked in our own time, and what new subtexts may be lurking in the shared stories we reconsider at different points in our lives. \u201cYou shift time and location to see what holds true, and why or why not,\u201d novelist Helen Oyeyemi says of the allure of fairy tales as a place of departure for a new work of fiction. We\u2019ll discuss work from writers drawn to subvert and repurpose fairy tales, including Helen Oyeyemi, Barbara Comyns, and Cristina Rivera Garza.",

On the other hand, in a time when everything claims to be about love, one may sometimes be tempted to wonder if nothing is, and the topic certainly provided a space for medieval writers to explore a number of related themes such as gender, class, cultural difference, nature, and truth. In this course we will consider a selection of these rich and paradoxical texts, as we read in a variety of\n genres by authors across Europe including but not limited to: Abelard and Heloise, Ibn Hazm, Marie de France, Chretien de Troyes, Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Christine de Pisan.",

    "course_title":"VICTORIAN SCIENCE&SCIFI",
    "course_descr":"Although Victorian fiction is best known today for its realist commitment to representing the world \u201cas it really is,\u201d especially in genres such as the courtship novel and the Bildungsroman, Victorian novelists also wrote during an age of enthusiastic scientific inquiry that questioned and revised the very fabric of the reality that realist genres purported to represent. This course will accordingly explore the more adventurous and speculative fiction of the Victorian period that was most closely attuned to these new ways of representing and thinking about reality. How did new scientific developments such as evolutionary theory in biology, and the atomic theory in physics, reshape how writers viewed the relationships between human and animal, self and other, space and time, body and mind? How did departing from traditional realist modes enable Victorian science fiction writers to explore the ethical, social, and political implications of scientific theories in ways that scientific prose may not have envisioned? In this course we will read major works of Victorian fiction, by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others, alongside selections of scientific prose in such fields of Victorian science as biology, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and psychology. Throughout the course, we will understand \u201cscience\u201d to include both major developments in the history of science, such as the emergence of evolutionary thought, as well as more eccentric Victorian areas of inquiry, such as phrenology, mesmerism, telepathy, and degeneration. The first three units into which the course is divided each explore a major field of Victorian science alongside a major conceptual category that it challenged and altered: biology and the nature of the human; psychology and the constitution of the self; the physical sciences and the nature of space and time. In each unit, we will investigate how writers\u2019 engagements with these conceptual questions led them to experiment with literary categories such as character, narration, and plot. The course will close with a unit on texts that more broadly address Victorian conceptions of progress, technology, and development. In addition to these specific thematic and formal questions, we will think broadly about how the Victorians understood the value of science and technology in relation to the arts and to literature, and ask what their answers to these questions can offer us as we navigate similar questions today.

The course will provide a conceptual framework for reading and critiquing the representation of nature in the context of historical, economic, social, cultural, scientific and political change.\n  \n The course design asks students to address climate change in the context of the industrial revolution before discussing environmental issues in a pre-industrial and finally a post-industrial context. We will begin in media res by addressing issues of industrialization and colonialism in the mid-18th and 19th century before considering indigenous, medieval, and renaissance representations of nature. In the second half of the course, we return to examine contemporary issues from the early 20th century to the present.\n  \n The course will meet twice weekly in Spring 2025. One of these meetings will include a lecture with a guest faculty member from Barnard and Columbia, or occasionally with other experts, artists, and activists from New York and beyond, followed by questions from the audience on the lecture. The second meeting will emphasize student discussion of the lecture and associated readings, with the purpose of integrating each lecture into the total course framework. Since all the participating faculty are teaching full time, we will aim to schedule lectures in the late afternoon or evening to minimize conflicts. We would also like to open some of the lectures to the public, either virtually or in person, so that their impact could be felt beyond the class itself.",

This course examines the element of change in a wide range of literature, from Ovid to Maggie Nelson, from Shakespeare to Roxane Gay\u2014but it also provides an opportunity for students to consider the ways in which they, too have been changed\u2014by joy, by trauma, by time. In addition to writing critically about the works we will read together, students will also write a personal essay about their experience of metamorphosis; this essay will be examined in a modified workshop format. At semester\u2019s end, students will re-write and change that same essay, in hopes of seeing how revision on the page might provide a model for understanding the metamorphoses we experience as human beings on this earth. Authors will likely include Ovid, Kafka, Robert Louis Stevenson, Borges, Shaun Tan, Roxane Gay, George Saunders, Arthur C. Clarke, Shakespeare, and Maggie Nelson.

As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project\u2014such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement. This class is about your own writing and that of your classmates. This class will be what you make of it!",

Why did so few of the very Jews to whom Jesus preached accept him as their messiah? Why, as the Church grew in wealth and influence, did Jews continue to live in Christian communities, and what was their proper place in Christian society? In our course, we will read early and medieval Christian narratives about Jews that are, in many ways, an attempt to answer these questions \u2013 dark imaginative visions of Jews as child-killers, cannibals, and devil worshippers. We will use narrative, psychological, and literary theory as tools to analyze these tales and to make sense of their complicated and continuing legacy.",

    "course_title":"Politics & Policy of Urban Sustainabilit",
    "course_descr":"This is a course for thoughtful people who wish to influence actual policy outcomes related to sustainability challenges in major cities. Its objective is not to provide a primer on urban sustainability solutions; this is readily available from textbooks and will change by the time you are in a position to act. Rather, the course\u2019s objective is to prepare you for the kind of challenges that will face you as a policy practitioner in the field of urban sustainability. Cities are increasingly recognized as a key level of government for environmental and sustainability policy. As at all levels, politics and policy are intensely intertwined, and perhaps more so at the local level because the decisions involved often affect constituents directly and intimately --in their neighborhoods, in their homes, in their commutes. This reading-heavy colloquium explores the politics and the policy of urban sustainability from the perspective of someone who wishes to effect change. It culminates in a team project in which students act as a sustainability policy team in a mayoral (or equivalent) office in one of the world\u2019s major cities. The course considers key components of the city itself, with the objective of understanding what shapes the city and its impact on the environment. It mainly uses case studies from the twentieth-century United States, paired with international readings to allow a comparison with other experiences. The focus on deep case studies allows the consideration of the situations, constraints, and political dynamics of specific situations. It is intended to provide students with the ability to recognize patterns in urban political and policy dynamics related to sustainability. These are paired with an overview of leading solutions and how the professor believes practitioners should evaluate them for their own cities. The course also prominently features in-class presentations and discussions of the students\u2019 main project: a team-based memo making a specific recommendation to solve a problem in a specific major world city, which is presented twice, once for a diagnosis of the problem in a given city and a second time with a policy recommendation. This project is the major portion of the overall grade for the class, and is used to allow the students to wrestle with the challenge of turning ideas from past and present into successful urban sustainability policies that can get implemented in a political and institutional world. In order to cover issues in depth, this course is not exhaustive;",

The course includes problem sets designed to teach core concepts and their application. In the spring semester, the emphasis is on the application of concepts to analyze contemporary policy problems. Some time is also devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn microeconomic concepts, but also how to explain them to decision-makers. Student groups take on specific earth system policy issues, analyze options through the use of microeconomic concepts, and then make oral presentations to the class.",

Please note that since this is a Film Studies course, it does not count as a creative writing course for English majors with a creative writing concentration. This course will focus on the primary pillar of television production: the teleplay. Through a number of creative exercises, students will learn the intricacies of the unique screenwriting formats that are the half-hour and hour-long teleplays. Together we will cover the differences between an episode arc and a seasonal one, the requirements of A\/B\/C story plotting, and how to write an effective show bible. We will survey the existing pantheon of great television writing in order to help students narrow in on their individual sensibilities. By the end of the course, students will have a written original pilot and a mini series bible.",

The Digital Series course is intended to take students from story ideation through creation of an\u00a0independent\u00a0digital series. Emanating from a writers room setting, all steps of the process will be explored and supported by in-class discussion, examples and workshops. This hands-on class revolves around the TV series production model: breaking story, writing\u00a0pages, preproduction planning, filming and post-production review. We will emphasize the writers voice, construction of series storytelling, and establishing realistic scopes of production.",

We will also consider how these queer films are informed by various local, national, cultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker\u2019s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers create queer narratives that contest, complicate or reify dominant narratives of gender and sexuality? How do they play around with cinematic and genre conventions?\n  \nFilms, directors and genres studied are subject to change but will likely include directors such as Celine Sciamma, Cheryl Dunye, Pedro Almodovar, Todd Haynes, among others; and various genres such as drama, romance, thriller, mockumentary, thriller and experimental film.",

    "course_title":"MAJOR WOMEN FILMMAKERS",
    "course_descr":"Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood\u2019s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as \u201cmarginal\u201d or \u201cperipheral\u201d cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet\u2026 are these motion pictures really \u201csecondary\u201d? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called \u201calternative women\u2019s cinema\u201d at the core of film history.\u00a0Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women\u2019s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertm\u00fcller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler. Among the films screened in the classroom are silent movies \u2013\nSuspense\n (Lois Weber, 1913),\n The Seashell and the Clergyman \n(Germaine Dulac, 1928)\u2014, early independent and experimental cinema \u2013\nGirls in Uniform \n(Leontine Sagan, 1931), \nRitual in Transfigured Time \n(Maya Deren, 1946)\u2014, \u201cnew wave\u201d films of the 1950s and 1960s \u2013\nCl\u00e9o from 5 to 7\n (Varda, 1962), \nDaisies \n(Chytilov\u00e1, 1966)\u2013, \nauteur\n cinema of the 1970s \u2013\nSeven Beauties \n(Wertm\u00fcller, 1974), \nJeanne Dielman \n(Akerman, 1975)\u2013, and documentary films \u2013",

It proposes to think as well about\u00a0textual time, meaning both how different genres orchestrate time and tempo but also how these authors are treated in ancient and modern reception. We will read theoretical studies of time and temporality, the event, and periodicity, as well as those more focused on genre and occasional performance. Discussions will center around close attendance on specific images and dynamics in the ancient texts, as well as the ways in which theoretical frames may illuminate these. Thus, for instance, seminars juxtapose the epic punctuation of bodies in space with Sappho's female lovers on the move, with scholarly readings deployed to critique the epic-lyric divide around these dynamics. A central and recurrent figure in this scheme is Helen, who is presented in Homeric epic as the central catalyst for the violent unfolding of events (i.e., the Trojan War) and who functions in lyric poetry as a cathexis for the violent consequences of desire.",

And yet scholars and lay people alike hold vastly differing opinions about the effects that inequality has on the social fabric, and the need to combat it. The question of how wealth and income are distributed among the members of a national community as well as among nations has acquired center stage in analyses about fundamental issues such as the causes of the progress and decline of societies and the dynamics of globalization. Inequality issues are at the heart of discussions about international economic relations, transnational phenomena such as migrations and the domestic economic platforms of political parties.\n  \nThis course will provide students with the critical instruments with which to analyze the main interpretations of economic inequality from the eighteenth century to the present. We will read and discuss authors who have addressed the question of inequality and distribution: how did they frame the issue? What visions of society emerged from their analyses? We will see how the concept of inequality has changed historically, how different dimensions (e.g., national and international) have appeared and disappeared, and how visions of national, international and global inequality inform debates about the foundational elements of the social compact.",

    "course_descr":"In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum \u2013 the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border \u201cproblem\u201d that of a so-called \u201csanctuary city.\u201d How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city\u2019s long history of refuge?\u00a0\n  \nThis course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible \u2013 or worthy \u2013 of protection.\n  \nThis is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.",

Gender bias can influence policy choices, distort understandings of military capability\u2014especially among nonstate armed groups with women combatants\u2014and aggravate the causes of war. It can increase internal and interstate violence in settings where women are mistreated or where sex imbalances create instability. Gender also shapes how individuals experience wars and disasters, as existing inequalities are often intensified. Bias can discourage women from pursuing careers in security policy, limiting states\u2019 access to a full range of talent.\n  \nThe intersection of gender and security has been formally recognized since the 2000 passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS). International organizations such as NATO have developed WPS policies, and the United States passed the Women, Peace, and Security Act in 2017 to integrate gender into the work of the State and Defense Departments.\n  \nThis course offers a sustained exploration of how gender identities and related power dynamics influence international and internal conflict, as well as security policy. Through case studies and examples, students will learn to conduct gender analyses and apply these skills through research, writing, and presentations. The course is structured as a discussion-based seminar to support collaborative learning.\n  \nThe course begins by defining gender and international security and examining why these concepts are difficult to define. Later sessions address the intersection of gender with other identity factors, explore how security institutions are gendered, and consider how to create gender-responsive policies. The course concludes by analyzing gendered strategies in conflict and state responses to conflict.",

    "course_descr":"Nuclear weapons are often considered to pose humanity\u2019s gravest danger. Yet despite nuclear threats and crises, states have managed to avoid the deliberate or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons since the end of World War II. Eighty years after Hiroshima, how has nuclear war been avoided? Did the advent of nuclear weapons create a revolution in military affairs that stalemated major powers and dramatically reduced the prospects of great power war by the emergence of mutual vulnerability and mutual assured destruction (MAD) postures? Or are nuclear weapons central to great power competition and valuable instruments of force, including for deterrence and coercion? Is there a taboo against nuclear use? Do the major theories about the nuclear era match actual practice and how has nuclear theory evolved? Are the strategies and approaches that were employed in the past still appropriate for the new multipolar nuclear age? Why do some states acquire nuclear weapons while others that have considered going nuclear (e.g., South Korea and Germany) so far forego the option, while still others (e.g., South Africa and Ukraine) have given up their nuclear weapons? What are the prospects for continued nuclear proliferation and hedging (e.g., Iran)?\n  \nThis class will explore past and current patterns of behavior among existing, potential, and former nuclear weapons states. Other questions that animate this course include: What do nuclear weapons actually deter? Can they be used for coercion? How do operational plans and force postures serve military and political objectives? What are the incentives, disincentives and risks of strategies premised on deliberate escalation to nuclear use? Do they increase the probability of inadvertent use of nuclear weapons? What role do nuclear weapons play in U.S. strategy and security policies? How does the U.S. experience compare to those of other nuclear weapon states, such as USSR\/Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea? This seminar will examine such questions to gain a better understanding of the importance of nuclear weapons for international relations.",

The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.\n  \n All assigned readings for the course will be in English.

These accounts of adolescent brain and behavior will then\n be discussed in the context of relevant legal, social and health policy issues. Lectures and discussion will\n address: Under what circumstances self control appears to be diminished in adolescents. How do\n dynamic changes in neural circuitry help to explain changes in self control across development? When\n does the capacity for self control fully mature? Are these changes observed in other species? How might\n these changes be evolutionarily adaptive and when are they maladaptive? How might understanding\n adolescent brain and behavioral development inform interventions and treatments for maladaptive\n behavior or inform policy for changing the environment to protect youth?",

Without the barn owl we would not fully understand how the brain detects interaural time differences and localizes sounds. Without echolocating bats our knowledge of three-dimensional navigation and memory would be diminished. Through the study of animal systems that are specialized for particular sensory and motor acts, scientists have been able to dissect the circuit computations underlying key behaviors, such as decision making, prey detection, foraging, mate selection, and communication, that are fundamental across species. Through short introductory talks and in-depth discussions of primary scientific literature, this course will provide a foundation for understanding these behaviors, and relate discoveries in animal research to broader themes in neurobiology, ecology, and medicine.",

    "course_descr":"This lab-based course introduces students to advanced methods in cognitive neuroscience, focusing on the application of electroencephalography (EEG) for real-time recording of brain activity. Unlike traditional approaches that study how the brain responds to different external stimuli or task demands, this course centers on spontaneous brain activity that occurs during rest or just before experimental events. Whether or not spontaneous brain activity is just meaningless noise remains an active area of research in cognitive neuroscience. Some researchers believe that spontaneous brain activity may be an important factor shaping our subjective experience of the world. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive in part due to the challenges in objectively defining and measuring subjective experience.\n  \nIn this course, students will address this challenge by developing methods to study the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and subjective experience, with a particular focus on mind-wandering and the sensory phenomena elicited by Ganzflicker and Ganzfeld stimulation. The course culminates in independent research projects where students test their hypotheses by collecting and analyzing behavioral and EEG data. Key questions to address include: can spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity account for why people sometimes zone out while performing a task? Can the same fluctuations explain why people sometimes have different sensory experiences despite constant external stimuli? Do individual variations in spontaneous brain activity help explain why some people are more likely to report such experiences?\n  \nNote: The course involves weekly in person meetings as well as asynchronous work on data acquisition, analysis, and primary article readings for approximately 6 additional hours per week (on average).",

In particular, we will consider the relationship between state and market, moral critiques of markets and exchange, analyses of the role of force and violence in accumulation, and theories of freedom and domination.",

To what extent and under what circumstances do elected officials consider public preferences in making policy? To what extent and under what circumstances might we want them to? What kind of power should the public have in American democracy? Thinking about the second and third, more normative questions leads us to other empirical questions. What shapes public preferences? How well can we measure them? How much do people know and care about politics? How do they evaluate their representatives? What constitutes high quality representation? We will examine these kinds of questions broadly, and also consider how they play out in particular policy areas and historical moments. We will also discuss the dynamics of public opinion across population subgroups (e.g. by race, sex, income, party, urbanity, etc.), and questions surrounding representation at the group level. In addition to engaging scholarly literature on public opinion and representation, students will also learn to access, manage, and analyze data measuring the composition of the public (e.g. the U.S. Census) as well as public views on political candidates, officeholders, institutions, and issues (e.g. survey data). These skills will help to prepare students for research projects in other courses and beyond Barnard.

We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods where drugs are trafficked to the Amazon where illegal extraction of natural resources poses significant threats to the environment at the local and global levels. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit economies touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, environmental degradation, state corruption, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on the Western Hemisphere.

    "course_descr":"Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent Description: The semester-long course aims to study political and social factors behind economic development and exam empirical cases of the success and failure in economic growth in order to understand the key features of the development processes. In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3. Understand some country specific political economy processes and how these processes prove or disprove certain theories and policies.",

This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to discuss the major underlying determinants of poor health and the relationship between health and political, social and economic development. Drawing upon the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, students will be introduced to the evolution of modern approaches to the setting of global health priorities, the functions and roles of health systems, an overview of current global health practices, and the major institutional players in global health. The first unit of the class will focus on establishing the foundations for a public health approach to understanding the challenges of global health. This will involve exploration of the factors shaping the global distribution of disease and their connection with issues of social, economic, and political development, as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals. The second unit will explore in further detail a number of major health priorities. A significant goal of the class will be to identify common sources of vulnerability and challenge across health risks, and the consequent need for a systemic approach to their being addressed. The third and final unit builds upon this analysis to demonstrate the multi-disciplinary, multi-level approach required to effectively address global health priorities, and the political and organizational cooperation required to achieve this. The class concludes with an analysis of the major challenges and threats to global coordination regarding such threats as pandemic influenza and emerging health threats related to climate change.

However, as Russia failed to transition into a democratic state, anti-Americanism and revanchism began to flourish. After becoming president, Vladimir Putin exploited these sentiments, ultimately making anti-Americanism a central aspect of his international political agenda. Russian propaganda has not only influenced the Russian population but also seeks to spread these ideas and conspiracy theories beyond Russia\u2019s borders. As an inherently unstable political system, Russia aims to destabilize the West. The course concludes with an analysis of present-day dynamics.",

The advantage of a thematic course allows us to cover various genres such as: ritual manuals; epic; poetry; philosophical argument; biographical accounts; prophecies; conversion stories; and medical textbooks to name a handful. At the end of the course, we will see how the texts encountered in the first part have been repurposed to speak to social justice movements around caste - both within South Asia and the diaspora population in the U.S. The thematic of dreaming and imagination also provides flexibility in method: because students will have the opportunity to study conversations between different historical actors across religious traditions about dreams, they will also have the opportunity to revise problematic accounts of religious pluralism and communalism in South Asia. Students will read primary texts from\u00a0Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Sikh traditions to name a handful.\u00a0Students can look forward to reading about worlds within rocks; falling asleep and waking up as another person only to die in the dream world, wake up and then realize your dream-life family is somehow real and looking for you; how to finally interpret those pesky dreams about teeth falling out; dismembered bodies generating the universe; daydreaming about a cloud that thinks mountain peaks look like nipples; how to build a mind-temple that Shiva prefers to the physical one with fancy rock; and much more!",

Students will identify models for medical structures of care, healing, and treatments in the context of religion, ritual, and quotidian life. Topics include diagnostic processes and the creation of categories, stigma and models of clinical care, hysteria, spirit possession, pharmaceuticals, and the relationship of trauma to political structures. This course has three sections: 1) the first portion undertakes a brief historical survey of medical disciplines and institutions in South Asia (such as the development of Ayurveda, Yun\u0101n\u012b \u1e6cibb, and the rise of the b\u012bm\u0101rist\u0101n); 2) the second portion of the course focuses on the rise of the asylum (sometimes called the p\u0101gal kh\u0101na) in tandem with psychiatry and its twinned consequence: the pathologization of asceticism by British colonial technologies of discipline; 3) the final portion examines the relationship between British colonialism and psychoanalysis with the introduction of this western discipline to the subcontinent.\u00a0\n  \nThis course will take \ncritical\n stock of historical structures throughout South Asia \nclaiming\n to provide care (such as family, caste, healthcare, mental asylums, colonialism, educational systems, pensions, and much more).

    "course_title":"Collective Action for Global Sustainable",
    "course_descr":"When externalities go uncorrected, and public goods go undersupplied, the reason is not that the market fails; the reason is that governments are unable or unwilling to intervene effectively. The biggest problem is with transnational externalities and regional and global public goods. This is partly because of the scale of these problems, but it is also because the institutional arrangements at this level make effective intervention difficult. There is no World Government. Instead, there are around 200 sovereign states. To support sustainable development globally, states must cooperate, and yet states' self-interests often conflict with their collective interests. This is why all countries agree that collective action must be taken to limit climate change, and yet, though they try and try again, countries seem unable to muster the individual action needed to meet their own collective goal. The aim of this course is to develop an apparatus for understanding international collective action for sustainable development. By an apparatus, I mean a theory, a structured way of looking at and understanding the world. Rather than just present the theory, my aim is to show you why theory is needed, how it has been constructed, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Basically, in addition to teaching you principles and tools, I want you to come to see how this field has developed, what it has achieved, and where it has fallen short. Throughout the course, we shall also be looking at tests and applications of the theory-empirical and experimental papers in addition to case studies. The course draws from a number of disciplines, especially economics, game theory (analytical and experimental), and international relations-but also international law, philosophy, history, the natural and physical sciences, and engineering. The focus will be on institutions, and the way that they restructure the relations among states to cause states to behave differently-that is, to cause them to undertake collective action. In terms of applications, the course will address not only climate change but also depletion of the ozone layer, trans-boundary air pollution, pollution of the oceans, over-fishing, biodiversity loss, and the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.",

    "course_title":"Structural Determinants of Health",
    "course_descr":"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one\u2019s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual\u2019s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.\u00a0This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the \u201cSocial\u201d Determinants of Health to the \u201cStructural\u201d Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes.\u00a0The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual\u2019s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an \u201cupstream\u201d approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes.\u00a0An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities.\u00a0Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual\u2019s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one\u2019s class position and the color of one\u2019s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experie",

Against the tendency to treat disability merely as a useful metaphor or to\n simply import Global Northern vocabulary and methodologies of disability studies to other\n locations, this course turns to Latin American literary texts by authors that have been directly\n \u201ctouched\u201d by disability to foreground the concerns, vocabularies, and commitments that their\n texts reveal. This includes authors who either through their personal experience with disability\n or as caretakers\u2014as parents, siblings, or close friends of people with disabilities\u2014have closely\n grappled with the experience of non-normative bodies and minds in the Latin American\n context. In this course we ask how are subjects with disabilities represented in a variety of\n genres (novel, essay, poem, graphic novel) and what constraints and possibilities circumscribe\n these subjectivities and their lives. Ultimately, we will ask what vision of disability justice\n emerges from these localized experiences and creative interventions beyond now globalized\n disability discourses of inclusion\/access and independence\/autonomy.",

It will include an introduction to original performance practices in ancient Greece (space, masking, choral performance, costume, acting techniques) and an examination of how artists from different contemporary theatrical traditions have adapted ancient texts in modern performances and new versions of the plays. The bulk of the course will be focused on the problems of acting, interpreting, and reinterpreting parts of three plays on the stage, Sophocles\u2019 \nAntigone\n, Euripides\u2019 \nMedea\n, and Sophocles\u2019 \nAjax\n along with a new version by Ellen McLaughlin, who teaches playwriting at Barnard, \nAjax in Iraq\n. Students will view all or parts of particularly interesting recent productions from various theatrical traditions, which will help them to tackle challenging issues such as choral performance and choral rhythms, masking, character work, dialogues and presenting formal political debates.\n  \nFor contemporary actors training in Greek tragedy offers a unique opportunity to improve their performance on stage through ensemble work and representing character through speech. \u00a0It enhances dramaturgical capacities that a contemporary theater practitioner must exercise in exploring theory in practice and vice versa.\n  \nThis class is directed to students particularly interested in dramaturgy, directing, designing, translation, and Greek tragedy as well as acting.",

How do these playwrights tackle questions of authenticity, influence, inspiration and agency? What stories do they adapt, translate or reimagine? Also, we read in equal measure male and female playwrights, attending to the ways in which power and authority are negotiated by them. This class looks both at plays that are seminal to postcolonial writing and also newer ones that unsettle the position of the greats. Do we then understand postcolonialism as a historically bound literary trend or an ongoing process of exploration? Fundamentally we ask, in our efforts to decolonize the theatre, how do we find new ways or reading?\u00a0\u00a0Course fulfills lecture\/seminar in drama studies, theatre studies, performance studies requirement for Theatre major.",

However, much has been learned about how to address the problem, so we will emphasize understanding the role of Big Tech in circulating and profiting from online mis\/disinformation and what policies\/regulations are in play.

As AI-generated media grows more sophisticated and accessible, questions of transparency and authenticity have become central to the global informational ecosystem. Digital content provenance\u2014an emerging open standard supported by thousands of organizations and recognized in recent policy actions such as the White House Executive Order on AI\u2014offers a potential path to restoring trust in what we see and hear online.\n  \nStudents will examine the technical foundations of provenance, including concepts such as public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities, and learn how provenance is being implemented across sectors including government, media, and technology. The course features guest speakers from industry and public service, providing insight into the policy, legal, and operational dimensions of this fast-evolving field.\n  \nThrough research, writing, and the creation of an original provenance-enabled project, students will develop a strong understanding of how digital content provenance works and its relevance to future regulatory frameworks. This course is designed for those interested in the intersection of AI, digital media, global policy, and emerging technology standards.",

This course introduces the emerging field of Trust & Safety: the study of how online platforms are abused and how these systems can cause individual and societal harms, as well as the frameworks and tools used to prevent and mitigate those harms.\n  \nStill relatively obscure but increasingly central to public policy and technology governance, Trust & Safety now spans issues including content moderation, disinformation, child safety, algorithmic harm, and state-sponsored influence operations. Students will build foundational knowledge of the field through academic texts, practitioner case studies, and engagement with tools, taxonomies, and governance approaches used in industry. Course topics include detection systems, enforcement methods, moderation tradeoffs, transparency frameworks, red teaming, and regulatory perspectives such as the EU Digital Services Act. Case studies will examine harms across the technological stack, from social media to video games, dating apps, and AI models.\n  \nStudents will also engage directly with the tensions and practicalities of operating, regulating, or covering these issues in a policy or product environment.

As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field. Students in the course will approach cities from a number of disciplines, not only through the reading, but also through assignments that take place in different locations throughout New York City.",

The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment.\n  \nThe core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more \u201clivable\u201d cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice.\n  \nThe course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning.",

In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a \u201cneighborhood school\u201d? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools. This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.",

Our course of study invites students to critically analyze environmental justice case studies and to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among urban populations and the social, political, and economic processes that lead to environmental inequality. We will also explore how racism is foundational to environmental exploitation and consider why global struggles for racial justice are crucial for protecting both people and the earth.

Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.\n  \nAmong others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.\n  \nThe course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar. Seminar-style presentation and discussion will rely heavily on student participation and preparation to consider the variety of spatial methods available and their implications on urban research and intervention. Woven throughout the semester is the development of a self-driven research project, through which students will engage and compare the methodological advantages and disadvantages of several assumptions, approaches, analyses, and datasets.",

Yet, historically, they have developed a politics and policymaking process that at once seems archetypically American and strangely foreign. We will consider who has power in cities and how that impacts policy priorities; whether America\u2019s traditional institutions of representation \u201cwork\u201d for urban America; how the city functions within our federal system; and whether neighborhood democracy is a meaningful construct. We will also consider the impact of politics on urban policymaking.\u00a0Can cities solve the myriad problems of their populations under existing institutional arrangements?\u00a0How are cities being affected by the post-pandemic work-from-home economy? Do the economic and social factors that impact urban politics and policy limit a city\u2019s capacity to find and implement solutions to urban problems? How has increasing income inequality and persistent racial discrimination impacted urban governance and policy making? Does political protest result in changes in urban policy? Finally, can urban politics be restructured to better address problems of inequity and racial justice. Do cities have a viable economic future in post-pandemic America?",

Drawing frequently on examples from New York City, students will analyze intergroup relations among Black, white, Latino, and Asian communities, as well as the causes and consequences of contemporary racial mobilization. The course will also address the influence of executive leadership, including the ongoing impact of the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and policies on racial discourse and governance.\n  \nStudents will begin with a historical overview of race as an organizing concept, then turn to contemporary themes such as inequality, governance, and the role of institutions in perpetuating or challenging systemic disparities. Topics include disenfranchisement, gentrification, civil rights, economic mobility, and spatial access.\n  \nThe course engages a range of policy areas, including education, immigration, housing, health, elections, poverty, political representation, transportation, and criminal justice. These will be considered in relation to party politics, group identity, coalition building, and intergroup conflict, with attention to both change and continuity in the intersection of race and American public life.\n  \nGuiding questions include: What role does collective racial identity play in shaping policy demands? Should race-based policymaking continue at the local, national, or international level? What lessons can be drawn from coalition politics in New York City and beyond? And what does meaningful political change look like in the twenty-first century United States?",

    "course_descr":"At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersection of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures\u2014including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies\u2014to consider some of the ways in which the body is constituted by such discourses, and itself serves as the substratum for social relations. Among the key questions we will consider are the following: What is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between presumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic and somatic experiences? \u00a0How do historical and political-economic forces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference? And most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by competing logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance to these and other categorizations?",

    "course_descr":"The seminar will focus on trends that have emerged over the past three decades in Jewish American women's writing in the fields of memoirs, fiction and Jewish history: the representation and exploration through fictive narratives of women's experiences in American Jewish orthodox communities; reinterpretation of Jewish history through gender analysis; the recording of migration and exile by Jewish women immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Morocco, Iran, and Egypt; and gender transformations. Texts will be analyzed in terms of genre structures, narrative strategies, the role of gender in shaping content and Jewish identity, and the political, cultural and social contexts in which the works were created. The course aims for students to discuss and critically engage with texts in order to develop the skills of analytical and abstract thinking, as well as the ability to express that critical thinking in writing.
