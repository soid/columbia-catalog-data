AFAS UN1001,INTRO TO AFRICAN-AMER STUDIES,"From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this “New World” democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S., but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the “middle passage” to the present so-called “post-racial” moment—drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature—to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e., agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e., migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e., uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e., Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.). By the end of the semester, students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of major themes/figures/traditions, alongside a range of cultural/political practices and institutional arrangements, in African-American Studies.",Kevin Fellezs,10:10am,11:25am,61498,Morningside,UN1001-20163-001,,"African-American Studies, Institute for Research in",AFAS,http://culpa.info/professors/11430,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161226224051/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AFAS/UN1001-20163-001/,614 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS GR6103,GREEKS&ART; ROMAN EMPIRE,"The incorporation of the Greek-speaking world into the Roman empire had far-reaching consequences for ancient artistic and architectural production—both in Rome itself and in Greece and Asia Minor, as well as in the broader eastern Mediterranean area. On the one hand, the adoption of Greek historical forms, styles, and iconographies by the Romans led to the formation of a system of visual communication of empire-wide import that transcended ethnically or nationally defined categories and yet never became completely oblivious of its roots. On the other hand, the new political, economic, and social conditions of the Greek provinces (as well as their integration into the above-mentioned system of visual communication) engendered a profound innovation of local artistic and architectural traditions, even and precisely in their manifestation of retrospective tendencies. This complex process, by which both Greek and Roman “identities” were subject to major shifts and re-definitions, deserves to be examined by taking into full account the multiplicity of perspectives that characterized it.",Francesco de Angelis,6:10pm,8:00pm,20798,Morningside,GR6103-20163-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/2923,silver,10.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161101191136/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GR6103-20163-001/,612 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Architecture

AHIS GR8313,RENAISSANCE ARCH TREATISE,"This course examines the relationship between architectural culture and the technology of printing in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The advent of printing has increasingly been seen as transforming all aspects of visual culture, including architecture. The historian Mario Carpo specifically has argued that mechanical reproduction created stable architectural images that removed the drift inherent in a system of drawn copies. In doing so, the printed treatise codified a new canon of easily reproducible, standardized Orders and marginaized a fluid sketchbook tradition built on the practice of copying drawings. But was print in fact that revolutionary? By examining manuscripts, printed books, drawings, and engravings, this seminar will attempt to gain a better understanding of how print shaped architectural thought and practice. In particular, we will analyze a series Renaissance architectural treatises and try to understand the complex, dialectical relationship between medium and content, both in terms of word and image.",Michael J Waters,10:10am,12:00pm,97097,Morningside,GR8313-20163-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/13347,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225212450/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GR8313-20163-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Architecture

AMST BC1510,THE PROFITS OF RACE,"Does race appear in American life in the ways we make, distribute, and consume goods?  If so, how? Through film, literary criticism, history, ethnography and philosophy, this course will examine how race manifests as an economic relationship. We will focus on the legacies of chattel slavery, the interconnections of race and property, and ongoing struggles for racial justice. The course is grounded in what Cedric Robinson has referred to as the “Black radical tradition”: a centuries-long intellectual and political tradition oriented towards contesting the definition of a specific group of people (Black people) as property. We will examine ways that this central economic claim, which underpinned the chattel slavery system, continues to appear in our own society, in prisons, international migration system, residential segregation, underemployment, and other ways.",Manu M Vimalassery,1:10pm,2:25pm,04782,Barnard College,BC1510-20163-001,,American Studies @Barnard,AMST,http://culpa.info/professors/13176,silver,15.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915042434/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMST/BC1510-20163-001/,304 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

We will consider two forms of internationalism: internationalism from above, “imperialism;” and internationalism from below, “radical democracy.” We will engage long-standing models in the analysis of empire, and focus on cultural, economic, and political dimensions to examine the centrality of imperialism to the United States, and the history of the United States within a context of global histories. On the other hand, radical democratic movements and ideas have long been articulated in relation to the American project. Central to these movements is the necessity of articulating demands for justice not as matters of civil rights, but as human rights. The lectures and readings in this course will engage the body of scholarship known as “transnational American Studies” to think about America, as an idea, a set of institutions, and a way of being, within a larger world.",Manu M Vimalassery,2:40pm,3:55pm,05437,Barnard College,BC3310-20163-001,,History @Barnard,AMST,http://culpa.info/professors/13176,silver,15.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161028170258/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMST/BC3310-20163-001/,405 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

BIOL C2005
 and 
BIOL C2006
 and one year of organic chemistry. 
Lecture and recitation. Students wishing to cover the full range of modern biochemistry should take both BIOC C3501 and C3512. C3501 covers subject matters in modern biochemistry, including chemical biology and structural biology, discussing the structure and function of both proteins and small molecules in biological systems. Proteins are the primary class of biological macromolecules and serve to carry out most cellular functions. Small organic molecules function in energy production and creating building blocks for the components of cells and can also be used to perturb the functions of proteins directly. The first half of the course covers protein structure, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanism. The second half of the course explores how small molecules are used endogenously by living systems in metabolic and catabolic pathways; this part of the course focuses on mechanistic organic chemistry involved in metabolic pathways.",Brent R Stockwell,2:40pm,3:55pm,26376,Morningside,C3501-20163-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOC,http://culpa.info/professors/2753,,13.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Stockwell,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623194832/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOC/C3501-20163-001/,417 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes within organisms that give rise to the immense complexity of life. This complexity emerges from a highly regulated and coordinated flow of chemical energy from one biomolecule to another. This course serves to familiarize students with the spectrum of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) as well as the fundamental chemical processes (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, etc.) that allow life to happen. In particular, this course will employ active learning techniques and critical thinking problem-solving to engage students in answering the question: how is the complexity of life possible? NOTE: While Organic Chemistry is listed as a corequisite, it is highly recommended that you take Organic Chemistry beforehand.",Danny N Ho,6:10pm,9:30pm,21815,Morningside,W3300-20163-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOC,http://culpa.info/professors/13171,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623194821/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOC/W3300-20163-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

BIOL 3700 will provide an opportunity for students interested in independent research work in a hospital or hospice setting. In these settings, where patients and their needs are paramount, and where IRB rules and basic medical ethics make “wet-lab biology research” inappropriate, undergraduates may well find a way nevertheless, to assist and participate in ongoing clinical research. Such students, once they have identified a mentor willing to provide support, participation, and advising, may apply to the faculty member in charge of the course for 2-4 points/semester in BIOL W3700. This course will closely follow procedures already in place for BIOL 3500, but will ask potential mentors to provide evidence that students will gain hands-on experience in a clinical setting, while participating in a hospital- or hospice-based research agenda.

Beyond intelligence and technical know-how, what separates effective leaders from other team members is a set of social skills (e.g. impression management, self-awareness). This course identifies these critical leadership skills and provides ideas and tools for improving them. Then, the course considers how social intelligence skills fit the needs of managers at different stages of their careers. In early stages, managers need to achieve a good person-job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities.

Even as fascism laid down its roots in parts of Europe, the struggle for independence from European colonial rule accelerated in Asia and Africa, and former subjects engaged with ideas and images about the shape of their new nations, in essays, fiction, poetry, and theater. Supporters and critics of nationalism existed on both sides of the metropole-colony divide, as calls for internationalism sought to stem the rising tide of ethnocentric thinking and racial particularism in parts of Europe as well as the colonies. We'll read works from the metropole and the colonies to track the crisscrossing of ideas, beginning with writers who anticipated the convulsive events of the 1930s and beyond (E.M. Forster, H.G. Wells, Gandhi), then moving on to writers who published some of their greatest work in the 1930s (Huxley, Woolf, C.L.R.

CLEN GU4021,EUR LIT IN THE MIDDLE AGES,"Prerequisites: Instructor's permission 
 (Lecture). Our encounter with the modern print text is a relatively impoverished event, compared to the multi-layered sensory experience of the medieval book. Medieval manuscripts display individualized hands, rubrication and marginalia, decoration and illustration, sometimes indications for performance (like musical notation). They negotiate between sight and sound; as Chaucer tells his 
listeners
, paradoxically, if they don't want to hear the Miller's Tale they can turn the 
page
. Manuscripts even smell and feel distinctive, depending on the source and preparation of their parchment, or the material of their bindings. In this course, we will attempt to re-conceive and re-embed some literary (and other) ""texts"" of the Middle Ages, most of them editorially created in the 19th and 20th centuries, within their original sites in the physical culture of the past: that is, in manuscripts and early printed editions, and in the settings of cultural creation and consumption those codices intimately reflect. Studying individual manuscripts in New York collections (especially Columbia University), in facsimile, and on-line, our investigations will move in two main directions. First, we will learn about some of the major arenas of book production across the high and later Middle Ages-the kind of manuscripts through which most people, most often, encountered the written word. These will include books of private devotion (and often public ostentation) such as Psalters and Books of Hours; classroom anthologies and related collections; annals and chronicles; herbals and bestiaries; romances and lives of saints. Most of these use the two dominant languages of high medieval textual culture in England: Latin and French. Among them will be the ""Aberdeen Bestiary"" and the Anglo-Norman 
History of St. Edward the King
 by Matthew Paris, or possibly Matthew's 
Life of St. Alban
 and its manuscript, Trinity College Dublin 177. All these materials will be available in translation. Second, those dominant modes of book culture will provide contexts for investigating manuscripts of what has become the canon of Middle English. For instance, we will study one or more Langland manuscripts, in part via the Electronic Archive of Piers Plowman. We will look at the large and beautifully decorated Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer, yet look too at Chaucer manuscripts that lay different, more modest claims on his text. Depending on the enrollment and interests of the seminar, we can",Christopher C Baswell,6:10pm,7:25pm,01180,Barnard College,GU4021-20163-001,BOOK CULTURES,English @Barnard,CLEN,http://culpa.info/professors/3980,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225131903/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/GU4021-20163-001/,405 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

CLEN GU4050,NEW WAVE CINE PARIS-HOLLYWOOD,"(Lecture). The term ""new wave"" was coined by a journalist to refer to an ""outburst"" of filmmaking that took place in France beginning in 1959. Although never a movement, and shortlived in terms of whatever aesthetic uniformity it may have had, its effects spread out across various European cinemas and it became the emblem for various American filmmakers well into the 1970s. The class will analyze a (somewhat random) series of such cineastes in an attempt to understand what now perhaps appears, from the current perspective, as one of the last gasps of high cultural production coming up against the reality of corporate necessity.

CLEN GU4521,TOPICS IN COMP LITERATURE,"(Lecture). In the period since 1965, fiction has become global in a new sense and with a new intensity. Comparison is built into it. Writers from different national traditions have been avidly reading each other, wherever they happen to come from, and they often resist ""national"" and regional labels altogether. If you ask the Somali writer Nuruddin Farah whether the precocious child of 
Maps
 was inspired by Salman Rushdie's 
Midnight's Children
, he will answer (at least he did when I asked him) that he and Rushdie both were inspired by Sterne's 
Tristram Shandy
 and Grass's 
The Tin Drum
. At the same time, the human experiences around which novelists organize their fiction are often themselves global, explicitly and powerfully but also mysteriously. Our critical language is in some ways just trying to catch up with innovative modes of storytelling that attempt to be responsible to the global scale of interconnectedness on which, as we only rarely manage to realize, we all live. This course will begin with the Sudanese classic 
Season of Migration to the North
, a rewriting of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" and will end with the British novelist Zadie Smith. In between we will discuss novels by Gabriel García Márquez, Marguerite Duras, Milan Kundera, W.G. Sebald, Roberto Bolaño, and others.

CLEN GU4625,BLACK PARIS,"(Lecture). An introduction to the deep engagement of peoples of African descent with the City of Light throughout the twentieth century. We will take up the full variety of black cultures that have taken shape in dialogue with Paris, including poetry, prose, journals and magazines, music, and film in English and French by African American as well as Francophone Caribbean and African artists and intellectuals. Our investigation will focus on a series of historical moments central to any understanding of black Paris: the efflorescence of the ""Jazz Age"" in the 1920s (especially through the many Harlem Renaissance artists who spent significant time in France); the emergence of the Négritude movement in the 1930s and 1940s (in relation to other currents such as surrealism, existentialism, and anti-imperialism); the great age of post-World War II expatriate writers such as James Baldwin and Richard Wright; and contemporary black culture in the hip hop era. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the political implications of thinking about black culture through the lens of Paris, whether at the height of the French colonial empire in the interwar period, during the US Civil Rights movement and the Algerian war of independence, or in relation to contemporary debates around religion and immigration. We will be especially attentive to ways Paris can be considered a culture capital of the African diaspora, through what Baldwin called ""encounters on the Seine"" among black intellectuals and artists from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Readings may include fiction, poetry, and autobiography by authors such as Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker, Claude McKay, Ho Chi Minh, Aimé Césaire, Léopold Sédar Senghor, Jean-Paul Sartre, Cheikh Hamidou Kane, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, William Gardner Smith, Chester Himes, Melvin Van Peebles, Calixthe Beyala, Maryse Condé, and Marie NDiaye; and literary and historical scholarship by Edward Said, Tyler Stovall, Dominic Thomas, Christopher Miller, Pap Ndiaye, and Bennetta Jules-Rosette, among others.

CLEN UN3145,LITERATURE OF MEDIEVAL COURTS,"Prerequisites: Instructor's permission 
 (Seminar). Britain's medieval aristocrats lived in the public eye, staging an array of elite performances including tournaments, coronations, weddings, hunts, and feasts. These performances were memorably lavish and entertaining, but more importantly, they asserted the aristocracy's superiority and power. This seminar will explore an archive of poetic and historical texts concerning the ritual and performative strategies of aristocratic courtship, heraldry, and chivalry. Ecclesiastical courts, in turn, develop an alternate nobility of faith as they elevate saints and condemn heretics. The seminar's persistent areas of inquiry will be into how medieval people conceived and performed their personal identity, and how social groups deployed public performances to claim social authority. Texts will include Chaucer's 
Knight's Tale
, saints' legends, the romances of 
Silence
, 
The Knight of the Swan
, and 
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
, and the minutes of the trial of Joan of Arc. Course requirements: weekly posts, a midterm paper of about 5 pages, a workshop presentation with annotated bibliography, and a research paper of about 20 pages.

The Kite Runner 
featured prominently in airport bookshops in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa? Such 
popularity
 on a global scale offers an occasion for 
critical reflection
 about the transnational economic forces and cultural politics that shape literary supply and demand. Our specific focus will be on novels, memoirs, and films whose authors come from places outside publishing centers of New York and London (Afghanistan, Haiti, India, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa), yet find massive audiences in the US, UK and worldwide. We will do some reading in literary and cultural theory, and we will attend to the material networks of publishing and distribution, in order to understand how these bestsellers emerge, what kinds of conventional narratives or images of otherness they reinforce, and what new narratives and images they might generate. How can we understand the relationship between these texts popularity and their literary role? What frameworks of evaluation and interpretation are appropriate for such texts? What do these texts tell us about globalization?

CLEN UN3950,TOPICS IN THEORY,"Prerequisites: Instructor's permission 
 (Seminar). Why do we like to watch horror films? tragic films? films with sad endings? Why do we like to look at news of tragedies (or, as Susan Sontag put it, why do we like to ""regar[d] the pain of others""?) What do horror and tragedy do for us, or to us? Behind these questions about the meaning of horror and tragedy as aesthetic forms is the haunting question: why do horror and tragedy happen? do they mean anything? Questions about the nature and meaning of tragedy and horror have been at the center of aesthetic thought since the 5th century BC, and remain central to aesthetic, literary, and film theory today. This course offers, effectively, a history of horror and tragedy, moving chronologically, from the earliest dramatic productions to recent films, and from the earliest theories of tragedy to more recent accounts of horror, tragedy, and spectatorship. We will read philosophical texts alongside plays and films from the same era: each revealing the richness of the others and testing the others' limits. Our focus on drama and film allows us to address the central question of spectatorship: what happens when we not only hear a story of horror or tragedy, but when we watch horror or tragedy unfold. Texts include works by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Racine, Mozart, Büchner, Wagner, Georges Méliès Fritz Lang, Bertolt Brecht, Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, with philosophical writings by Aristotle, Augustine, Boethius, Descartes, Hume, Schiller, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Derrida, Judith Butler, and more.

CLME W3928,ARABIC PRISON WRITING,"This course studies the genealogy of the prison in Arab culture as manifested in memoirs, narratives, and poems. These cut across a vast temporal and spatial swathe, covering selections from the Quran, Sufi narratives from al-Halllaj oeuvre, poetry by prisoners of war: classical, medieval, and modern. It   also studies modern narratives by women prisoners and political prisoners, and narratives that engage with these issues. Arabic prison writing is studied against other genealogies of this prism, especially in the West, to map out the birth of prison, its institutionalization, mechanism, and role.

CPLS GR6115,"ANARCHY: HIST,THEORY,PROSPECTS","The course aims to research, review, and reconsider the historical and philsophical conditions and premises of anarchism, as a movement that emerges in the 19th century, culminates in certain instances in the middle of 20th century, and is beginning to re-emerge as a political option in the current international youth and anti-globalization movements. In this specific way, the course will explore the affinities between anarchism and radical democracy, again in both theoretical and historical spheres. In addition, however, the course will consider the philosophical underpinnings of anarchy as a particular mindset toward, not only political forms and practices, but also forms and structures of knowledge more generally. This latter dimension will involve both ancient Greek and contemporary discussions of epistemology, particularly insofar as conditions of archÄ“ (origin and rule) are conceptualized in the absence of extrinsic norms. The overall impetus is to reflect on historical structures so as to elucidate contemporary conditions of both knowledge and political practice, as they have manifested themselves in a ""global"" demand for a radical democratic life.",Stathis Gourgouris,10:10am,12:00pm,23160,Morningside,GR6115-20163-001,"ANARCHY: HIST,THEORY,PROS","Comparative Literature and Society, Center for",CPLS,http://culpa.info/professors/1709,silver,4.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stathis_Gourgouris,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225100848/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR6115-20163-001/,1106B Seeley W.

CPLS GR6333,EAST/WEST FRAMETALE NARRATIVES,"Frametale narratives, the art of inserting stories within stories, in oral and written forms, originated in East and South Asia centuries ago; tales familiar to Europe, often called novellas, can trace their development from oral tales to transmitted Sanskrit and Pahlavi tales, as well as Arabic and Hebrew stories. Both Muslim Spain and Christian Spain served as the nexus between the East and Europe in the journey of translation and the creation of new works. Through readings and films, and employing the theoretical concepts of Homi Bhabha (liminality, hybridity, third space) and Etienne Balibar (frontiers and the nation), as well as selected readings of Fernand Braudel and others on the Mediterranean world, the course examines the structure, meaning, and function of ancient, medieval, and early modern frametale narratives, using as theoretical frame in three ways: 1) Theory and practice of frames. Frames are not neutral; they can be narrative seductions, guiding and even strongly manipulating how we read the stories that follow; they can be used to reflect the intersections of orality and literacy. In order to understand their enduring power, we also explore the idea of literary frames through some contemporary films. 2) The exploration in their cultural contexts of topics such as the literary figures of the anti-hero and the trickster, precursors to the picaresque, women in the courtroom, the conflict of chance and human agency, monstrous births as political prophecy, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish relations in medieval and early modern Mediterranean cultures, the sexual frankness of the novella form, and gender politics. 3) How are narratives formed? The course traces the development of the short tale/novella from its ancient Asian origins through the seventeenth century, when Cervantes' literary experiments gave new life to the novella form, and the Spanish writer María de Zayas challenged Cervantes' views on love and marriage in her own highly regarded collections of novellas; we move to the present with the study of three contemporary films. But before they became complex and entertaining narratives, many of the well known tales had their ""bare bones"" origins in joke books, laws and legal theories, conduct manuals, collections of aphorisms and other wise and pithy sayings, misogynist non-fiction writings, and Biblical stories. Although the works are available in English translations, lectures will refer to meanings in both English and the original languages; students who can read the original works in",Patricia E Grieve,2:10pm,4:00pm,72348,Morningside,GR6333-20163-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Center for",CPLS,http://culpa.info/professors/1594,,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225212508/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR6333-20163-001/,505 Casa Hispánica,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

However, to grapple with these issues, we must locate them in their social, cultural, political, and historical contexts. Narrative understanding helps unpack the complex power relations between North and South, state and worker, disabled body and able-body, bread-earner and child-bearer, as well as self and the Other (or, even, selves and others). If disease, violence, terror, war, poverty and oppression manifest themselves narratively, then resistance, justice, healing, activism, and collectivity can equally be products of a narrative based approach to ourselves and the world.",Sayantani T Dasgupta,10:10am,12:00pm,60999,Morningside,GU4220-20163-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Center for",CPLS,http://culpa.info/professors/9811,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161014102619/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GU4220-20163-001/,420 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

EAAS GR8042,CLASSICAL CHINESE POETRY,"This graduate seminar reads canonical medieval poems against their relevant counterparts in leishu (compendiums arranged by classification systems that served as writing handbooks). We examine these compendiums as thresholds—lying outside the poems as their ostensible background material, these thesholds not only frame questions of genre and genealogy but also mediate the borders of poems. Some questions posed by this course: What conceptual paradigms are operative in the deployment of particular classifications? What are the implications for interpretive practice to regard a genre not as an archetype of abstracted qualities but, as these compendiums suggest, as something embodied by exemplars? Insofar as categories are organized by intertextual references, what is the relationship between lei and the work of allusion? What are the criteria and ramifications for determining the operative scope of allusions—are ‘contiguous’ but elided passages also in play? What is the family resemblance between leishu and commentaries like that of Li Shan for the Wenxuan anthology that do not so much give glosses as draw intertextual relationships? In what ways do lei furnish genealogies for things? What are the limits of ‘close reading’ on one hand and sprawling ‘intertextuality’ on the other?",Harrison Huang,2:10pm,4:00pm,98596,Morningside,GR8042-20163-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225212453/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EAAS/GR8042-20163-001/,313 Pupin Laboratories,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

In a seminar format, we will discuss short stories, newspaper articles, essays, memoirs, paintings, photographs and films.

Readings cover a wide selection of modern Chinese fiction and poetry, autobiographical writing, photography, documentary film, artworks, and music with emphasis on the interplays of art/literature, history, and politics. Close attention is paid to the role of storytelling, the mediating powers of technology, new forms of visuality and sense experience, and the emergence of critical consciousness in response to global modernity. In the course of the semester, a number of contemporary Chinese artists, filmmakers, and writers are invited to answer students’ questions.   This course draws on cross-disciplinary methods from art history, film studies, anthropology, and history in approaching texts and other works. The goal is to develop critical reading skills and gain in-depth understanding of modern China and its engagement with the modern world beyond the cold war rhetoric. Our topics of discussion include historical rupture, loss and melancholy, exile, freedom, migration, social bonding and identity, capitalism, nationalism, and the world revolution.

We will look at how these religions have interacted with each other, as well as the ways in which they have been both influenced and been shaped by Korean culture and politics. We will also pay
close attention to the ways in which Korea has developed its own distinctive religious traditions on the basis of active interactions with those of other countries: Korea was exposed to Buddhism, Confucianism,
and Catholicism through China, as well as Protestantism which was brought directly from the West. We will explore how Koreans not only transformed these imported traditions and incorporated elements of
their own indigenous traditions to meet their own religious needs, but also served as active agents or participants in the development, for example, of pan-East Asian religious traditions such as Hwaŏm/
Huayan/ Kegon Buddhism.",Seong-Uk Kim,9:10am,10:25am,65950,Morningside,UN3810-20163-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EARL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160905060015/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EARL/UN3810-20163-001/,501A International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

.  A major goal is for students to understand the science behind environmental issues.  Readings from the scientific literature, various newspaper articles, magazines and an online textbook are carefully coordinated with the topics. Because of our location, the lab curriculum features studies of the Hudson River and its forested shorelines.  The lab is closely paired with the lecture and features hands-on and inquiry-based lab and field studies of statistics, data presentation, writing in the format of a scientific paper, data collection (on land and on the Hudson River), water chemistry, microbiology, microscopic and macroscopic life in the river, birds and plants in Riverside Park, biodiversity on a green roof, local geology, topographical maps, compass use, and museum studies.  Students must also register for one of the eight lab sections EESCX1011.  Students must take both lecture and lab.",Terryanne Maenza-Gmelch,11:40am,12:55pm,04606,Barnard College,BC1001-20163-001,,Environmental Sciences @Barnard,EESC,http://culpa.info/professors/2870,silver,13.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045134/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/BC1001-20163-001/,202 Altschul Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

Defined by humanism, the Protestant Reformation, and revolution, this was a period of ideological struggle on many levels.

""I would never be part of anything. I would never really belong anywhere, and I knew it, and all my life would be the same, trying to belong, and failing. Always something would go wrong. I am a stranger and I always will be, and after all I didn't really care.""-Jean Rhys. 
This course examines the experiential life of the novelist as both artist and citizen. Through the study of the work of two towering figures in 20th century literature, we will look at the seemingly contradictory condition of the novelist as both outsider and integral to society, as both observer and expresser of time's yearnings and passions. In different ways and with different repercussions, Jean Rhys and Albert Camus were born into realities shaped by colonialism. They lived across borders, identities and allegiances. Rhys was neither black-Caribbean nor white-English. Albert Camus could be said to have been both French and Algerian, both the occupier and the occupied, and, perhaps, neither. We will look at how their work reflects the contradictions into which they were born. We will trace, through close reading and open discussion, the ways in which their art continues to have lasting power and remain, in light of the complexities of our own time, vivid, true and alive. The objective is to pinpoint connections between novelistic form and historical time. The uniqueness of the texts we will read lies not just in their use of narrative, ideas and myths, but also in their resistance to generalization. We will examine how our novelists' existential position, as both witnesses and participants, creates an opportunity for fiction to reveal more than the author intends and, on the other hand, more than power desires.",Hisham Matar,4:10pm,6:00pm,03784,Barnard College,BC3192-20163-001,ESTRANGEMENT/EXILE GLOBAL LIT,English @Barnard,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/11672,,1.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_Matar,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915050419/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3192-20163-001/,406 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

 (2015), finding in marriage the ""keystone of our social order"" - the means by which individual desire is stably fixed within the family unit and, thereby, linked to civility and law.  This course studies a rich counter-tradition of film and literature interested in adultery.  These works suggest ways in which human desire and identity exceed social bounds; they also examine ways in which private desire is not only limited but formed by social forces.  Works may include: fiction by Flaubert, Goethe, James, Laclos, Proust, Tolstoy; films by Frears, Kieslowski, Renoir, Resnais, Wilder, Wong; criticism and philosophy by Barthes, Beauvoir, Cavell, Cott, Freud, Hegel, Marx.",Andrew L Lynn,4:10pm,6:00pm,00133,Barnard College,BC3902-20163-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/2789,silver,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915050430/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3902-20163-001/,102 SULZBERGER A,,"Barnard

Examines contemporary African American literature, in particular the ways in which recent authors are reconceiving literary notions of blackness. Beginning in the 1980s with the emergence of ""post-soul"" literature, this class explores the ways in which authors one or two generations after the Civil Rights Movement reconfigure their sense of racial ""belonging"" and notions of how to write ""blackness"" into a text.

We will investigate the genres that we now term ""biography"" and ""autobiography,"" but which in early modern periods were inchoate, experimental forms. The course will be particularly interested in examining 
how

when,
 
and why
 early modern life-writers wrote; how the writing of others' lives (biography) may have influenced how one wrote one's own life (autobiography); the impact of religious doctrines on a sense of one's own life, and on modes of self-writing; the relationship between clearly autobiographical forms (the diary, the journal, the life-story) and other forms of writing (the account-book, the printed almanac, and so on). We will explore the impact of major social, political and religious changes (notably the English Reformation and the Civil Wars, Interregnum, and Restoration) on life-writing of various kinds. The writers studied range from the well-known (Samuel Pepys, Izaak Walton, John Aubrey) to the more obscure, with particular attention paid to non-elite and women writers.",Alan Stewart,8:10am,10:00am,74692,Morningside,GR6129-20163-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/2053,,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225212457/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6129-20163-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ENGL GU4612,JAZZ STUDIES,"(Lecture). An overview of jazz and its cultural history, with consideration of the influence of jazz on the visual arts, dance, literature, and film; an introduction to the scholarship and methods of jazz studies.  In this course we start with Ralph Ellison's suggestive proposition that many aspects of American life are ""jazz-shaped."" How, to begin with, might we define the music called jazz? What are its aesthetic ingredients or forms? What have been its characteristic sounds? How can we move towards a definition that sufficiently complicates the usual formulas of call-response, improvisation, and swing (or polyrhythmical complexity with an Afro-beat)--to encompass musical styles that really are quite different but which nonetheless are typically classified as jazz? With this ongoing problem of musical definition in mind, we will examine works in literature, painting, photography, film, and choreography which may be defined as ""jazz works"" or ones that are ""jazz-shaped"": which use jazz as a model or metaphor. What is jazz-like about these works? What's jazz-like about the ways they were produced? And how, to get to the other problem in the course's title--is jazz American? What is the relationship of art to nation? What is the logic of American exceptionalism? What do we make of the many international dimensions of jazz music-of, for instance, itsmany non-American practitioners? What is (or was) a jazz culture? What are (or were) its dates?",Robert G O'Meally,11:40am,12:55pm,23322,Morningside,GU4612-20163-001,JAZZ & AMERICAN CULTURE,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/232,silver,18.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161226224141/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4612-20163-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENVP U6225,"ETHICS, VALUES AND JUSTICE","The purpose of this course is to examine the claims made by multiple stakeholders for use of the environment, both natural and built, and to determine how contention among them can be ethically resolved in the policy process. Over time, six major clusters of stakeholders have arisen, expressing environmentalist standpoints: three, including proponents of wilderness, ecosystems, and nonhuman species, have been called nonanthropocentric; and three, including proponents of conservation, environmental justice, and sustainability, have been called anthropocentric. Among them a diverse array of ethical quarrels has arisen, yet today the sustainability outlook appears to be ascendant in popular and public discourse. Claims made regarding greater or lesser use of both natural and human resources continue to be debated nonetheless. Many are related to the issues of whether present use should take into account past wrongful, often inter-racially prejudicial actions, and future-regarding, often inter-generationally beneficial actions. The course aims to examine specific principles, such as polluter pays for pollution, prior free informed consent, transboundary accountability, and common responsibility, which can be used to resolve ethical issues. Consideration is given to the possibility of both collective and individual ethical action, even in situations of corruption, including subtle forms involving campaign contributions with a pay-to-play aspect.

ENVP U6250,"POVERTY,INEQUALITY & THE ENVIR","Progress and Poverty (1879), by the American economist and philosopher Henry George, was a worldwide bestseller and major impetus to reform movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. George argued that owners of land and other natural resources--a small fraction of the population--gain most of the benefits of economic growth. They also withhold high quality resources from use, driving down wages and forcing economic activity to sprawl out onto marginal land. His remedy: ""We must make land common property,"" not by nationalizing it, but by collecting the surplus (economic rent) by taxation, using the revenue for public benefit. See (www.schalkenbach.org/100-years-later.html.) Today, George's ideas powerfully influence both the field of ecological economics and the commons movement. (See www.onthecommons.org.) In this course we will read Progress and Poverty, examining how well George's ideas have stood the test of time. We will read excerpts from predecessors and contemporaries of George, including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen. We will also read modern authors, including economist Mason Gaffney and commons movement founder Peter Barnes. Topics we will cover include: Poverty, its definition and measurement. Inequality of wealth and income, and the relationship of inequality to poverty, wage levels, health, environmental destruction and ""sustainability"". Population size, age structure and geographic distribution. Economics of common resources. Economic rent and property rights. Economics of cooperation and competition. Inequality, trade and global sprawl. Growth and the boom and bust cycle. Economics of time--how do and should we make decisions about the future? Tax and other policy options.",Mary Cleveland,9:00am,10:50am,87753,Morningside,U6250-20163-001,,International and Public Affairs,ENVP,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160629234442/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENVP/U6250-20163-001/,1302 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,M,20163ENVP6250U001,LECTURE

FYSB BC1269,THE AMERICAS I,"Transcends the traditional and arbitrary distinction that separates North and South American literatures. The Americas emerge not as a passive colonial object but as an active historical and aesthetic agent. Emanating from what might be called the geographical site of modernity, American literature is characterized by unprecedented diversity and innovation. In addition to classic American novels, short stories, and poetry, the multicultural curriculum features genres ranging from creation myths and slave narratives to Gothicism and magic realism. Texts include: Popul Vuh; Shakespeare, The Tempest; Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Anne Bradstreet, and Phillis Wheatley, selected poetry; Madre Marïa de San Josï, Vida; Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly; Toussaint L'Ouverture, selected letters; Leonora Sansay, Secret History; Olaudah Equiano, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano; William Apess, A Sonof the Forest; Esteban Echeverrïa, ""The Slaughterhouse""; Herman Melville, ""Benito Cereno.",Jennifer L Rosenthal,10:10am,11:25am,00801,Barnard College,BC1269-20163-001,,First-Year Seminar Program @Barnard,FYSB,http://culpa.info/professors/4526,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045210/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FYSB/BC1269-20163-001/,117 Barnard Hall,,Barnard,3,,TR,20163FYSB1269X001,SEMINAR

FYSB BC1455,LITERATURE AND JUSTICE,"In this seminar, we will examine a series of texts from the Western literary tradition--along with a few seminal works of classic and contemporary cinema--to consider how and why they thematize characters' quests for justice. From the ties of kinship to the bonds of citizenship, from the articulation to the deconstruction of transcendental moral codes, from the traumatic demands of law to the (often equally traumatic) exigencies of revenge, we will explore the many intricacies of ""justice"" as both an ubiquitous literary topos and an abiding ethical issue. Authors studied will include Aeschylus, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Molière, the Marquis de Sade, Heinrich von Kleist, Franz Kafka, Jean Anouilh, Jean-Paul Sartre, W.H. Auden and Martin Amis. Secondary readings will be drawn primarily from philosophical and psychoanalytic sources, such as G.W.F. Hegel, Heinz Kohut, and Jacques Lacan. Along with filmed adaptations of our primary literary works, we will view and discuss the movies Claude Lanzmann's ""Shoah"" and Joel Schumacher's ""Falling Down.",Caroline Weber,2:40pm,3:55pm,07430,Barnard College,BC1455-20163-001,,First-Year Seminar Program @Barnard,FYSB,http://culpa.info/professors/2677,silver,8.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Weber_%28author%29,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045222/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FYSB/BC1455-20163-001/,117 Barnard Hall,,Barnard,3,,TR,20163FYSB1455X001,SEMINAR

FYSB BC1460,MEMORY,"Memory is arguably the most important faculty that we possess. Not surprisingly, memory has been a ubiquitous topic in poetry, science, fiction, and in the media. Ironically, memory's value is perhaps best understood when it ceases to exist. Indeed, it isn't hard to imagine the devastation that comes with memory loss. In this course, we will survey various components of memory, including its role in writing and history, and its existence in various non-human populations. In addition, we will explore the fragility of memory, including distortions, unusual memories, and basic forgetting. Readings will include poems, theoretical essays, scientific articles, and fiction. Assignments will consist of essays, opinion pieces, and creative stories. Students will also participate in a final in-class debate.  Readings will include works from William Blake, James Joyce, Mary Elizabeth Coleridge, Emily Dickinson, Ben Jonson, Mary Carruthers, Francis Yates, Aristotle, William James, Elizabeth Loftus, Spinoza, Luria, J.L. Borges, S. Freud, Oliver Sacks, Truman Capote",Lisa K Son,10:10am,11:25am,01446,Barnard College,BC1460-20163-001,,First-Year Seminar Program @Barnard,FYSB,http://localhost:8801/professors/811,,25.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045225/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FYSB/BC1460-20163-001/,118 Barnard Hall,,Barnard,3,,TR,20163FYSB1460X001,SEMINAR
FYSB BC1465,ON DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES,"In the dead of night it is not uncommon for even the most socially staid of individuals to fly, to ride an elephant at breakneck speed, to visit with the dead, or to expose themselves in public. Ancient Egyptians struggled to understand how and why we dream, as have countless individuals in other times and cultures. Some thinkers, ancient and modern, have dismissed dreams as essentially meaningless byproducts of natural processes. Others have taken dreams seriously as a primary means of access to an ordinarily imperceivable world in which one can commune with spirits and deities and receive from them valuable information about future events or even one's own health. The implications of this belief have led to vigorous theological debates as to whose dreams may be trusted (and, alternatively, whose need to be actively suppressed). From Freud onward, many have felt that dreams offer the key not to other worlds but to the complicated realm of the psyche. Over the course of our semester we'll look at how scientists, philosophers, hypochondriacs, pious pagans and monotheists, opium addicts, psychologists, playwrights, novelists, artists, and film directors have understood dreams and been inspired by them. Authors whose works we'll read include Aristotle, Cicero, Chung Tzu, Freud, Carl Jung, Andre Breton, H.P. Lovecraft, Jorge Borges, Ursula Le Guin, Neil Gaimon, and many others. Special attention will likewise be paid to the phenomenon of lucid dreaming and to the immense influence this practice has had on the creative output of both writers and filmmakers.",Ellen Morris,11:40am,12:55pm,02644,Barnard College,BC1465-20163-001,,First-Year Seminar Program @Barnard,FYSB,http://culpa.info/professors/5079,silver,9.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161007134845/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FYSB/BC1465-20163-001/,118 Barnard Hall,,Barnard,3,,MW,20163FYSB1465X001,SEMINAR
FYSB BC1598,BUILDING UTOPIA,"Building Utopia examines the rich tradition of utopian thinking in literature, social philosophy,architecture, and the visual arts. Here, utopia is explored in its modern form: as a call to transform the world through human planning and ingenuity. Aside from an important excursus on Thomas More’s pivotal novel Utopia (1516), the course centers on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers whose often wild and idealistic imaginings profoundly affected the shape of the real world. We’ll read and explore the works of Charles Fourier, Edward Bellamy, the Italian Futurists, and Le Corbusier, among many others.  The purpose of the course is to better understand the role that the utopian imagination has played in the construction of power.",Ralph Ghoche,11:40am,12:55pm,02129,Barnard College,BC1598-20163-001,,First-Year Seminar Program @Barnard,FYSB,http://culpa.info/professors/13122,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045230/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FYSB/BC1598-20163-001/,118 Barnard Hall,,Barnard,3,,TR,20163FYSB1598X001,SEMINAR

The viewing and discussion of films is facilitated through a consideration of a wide range of materials, including novels, criticism, archival footage, and interviews with directors.

HIST GR8977,AFTERMATH OF MASS VIOLENCE,"This graduate colloquium deals with a rather unordinary topic: the vengeance of the victims. Emerging from a genocide or any other mass murder, the survivors or their relatives are they tempted by revenge? If so, in what way, with what means, what aims and with what magnitude? Even if reactions of pure revenge (murders, lynch justice, retaliations) committed by the victims themselves have been more or less marginal, there were some: in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide (Operation Nemesis), after the Holocaust (against the Germans or their collaborators), or in Rwanda, at a larger scale, after the genocide of the Tutsis. The objective isn’t just to describe some examples of revenge, but to reintroduce this element in the analysis of other post-genocide components, mainly the question of justice and the fight for the acknowledgement of these crimes. To what extent the question of vengeance was present in the postwar trials, from the end of WWI to the recent international trials? Do the resentment played a role in the action of famous Nazi-hunters, like Wiesenthal or Klarsfeld? Why this dimension, theorized for example after the Holocaust by authors like Jean Améry has been completely played down in the recent narratives about memory?",Henry Rousso,10:10am,12:00pm,12399,Morningside,GR8977-20163-001,,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225191616/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8977-20163-001/,522A Kent Hall,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,R,20163HIST8977G001,COLLOQUIA

This course is both a conceptual history of geopolitics as the term has been defined and applied over the last hundred years, as well as a critical survey of the changing relations among technology, state power, and spatiality in connection to strategies of global competition and conflict.

In  “real life,” however, interactions among people, linguistic communities, and cultures frequently cut across political divisions. Water – rivers, streams, seas – is often an invitation to settlement, commerce, and conquest. This course offers a look (inspired in part by Fernand Braudel's 
Mediterranean
) at a body of water – the Black Sea – and the lands around it, in sweeping historical perspective. Focus is on those moments when the various civilizations and empires that originated and flourished around the Black Sea met and intersected in friendship or in enmity. We will look at ancient civilizations, Greek colonization, Byzantine-Slav interactions, the period of Ottoman dominance, Russian-Turkish rivalry, and decolonization and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries.

HIST GU4285,SOV UNION & RUSSIA 1953-2012,"This class focuses on the history of the Soviet Union and Russia between the death of Stalin/the end of totalitarianism and the present. It spans the turning-point date of 1991 when the Soviet Union abolished itself and was replaced by successor states, the most important of which is Russia. Not ending Soviet history with 1991 and not beginning Russian history with it either, we will seek to understand continuities as well as change. We will also draw on a diverse set of texts (and movies), including history, political science, journalism, fiction, and memoirs, feature and documentary movies. Geographically weighted toward Russia (and not the other also important successor states), in terms of content, this class concentrates on politics and society, including, crucially, the economy. These concepts, however, will be understood broadly. To come to grips with key issues in Soviet and Russian history in the historically short period after Stalinist totalitarianism, we will have to pay close attention to not only our analytical categories, but also to the way in which the political and the social have been understood by Soviet and Russian contemporaries. The class will introduce students to crucial questions of Russia's recent past, present, and future: authoritarianism and democratization, the role of the state and that of society, reform and retrenchment, communism and capitalism, and, last but not least, the nature of authority and legitimacy.",Tarik C Amar,10:10am,12:00pm,75145,Morningside,GU4285-20163-001,,History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/7461,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225191731/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GU4285-20163-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

This seminar will explore the ""dark side of Europe:"" the succession of genocidal episodes perpetrated during the long 20th century by Europeans in colonial expeditions overseas and in murderous campaigns on the subcontinent itself. The assigned literature ranges from anthropology, sociology and political science, to psychology and contemporary history. It contains a variety of perspectives on genocidal regimes and their perpetrators, as well as an array of descriptive accounts of episodes of mass anihilation. An overall theoretical framework is provided by Prof. Abram de Swaan's 
The Killing Compartments: The Mentality of Mass Murder 
(Yale UP, 2015). The experience with mass violence of the Dutch - a nation with a relatively peaceful past and a self-image of righteousness - will serve as a touchstone for a subcontinent that at the dawn of the 20th century was considered the epitome of peace an progress.

HIST GU4588,"RACE, DRUGS, AND INEQUALITY","Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 Through a series of secondary- and primary-source readings and research writing assignments, students in this seminar course will explore one of the most politically controversial aspects in the history of public health in the United States as it has affected peoples of color: intoxicating substances. Course readings are primarily historical, but sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists are also represented on the syllabus. The course's temporal focus - the twentieth century - allows us to explore the historical political and social configurations of opium, alcohol, heroin, cocaine, medical maintenance (methadone), the War on Drugs, the carceral state and hyperpolicing, harm reduction and needle/syringe exchange. This semester's principal focus will be on the origins and evolution of the set of theories, philosophies, and practices which constitute harm reduction. The International Harm Reduction Association/Harm Reduction International offers a basic, though not entirely comprehensive, definition of harm reduction in its statement, ""What is Harm Reduction?"" (http://www.ihra.net/what-is-harm-reduction): ""Harm reduction refers to policies, programmes and practices that aim to reduce the harms associated with the use of psychoactive drugs in people unable or unwilling to stop. The defining features are the focus on the prevention of harm, rather than on the prevention of drug use itself, and the focus on people who continue to use drugs.""[1] Harm reduction in many U.S. communities of color, however, has come to connote a much wider range of activity and challenges to the status quo. In this course we will explore the development of harm reduction in the United States and trace its evolution in the political and economic context race, urban neoliberalism, and no-tolerance drug war. The course will feature site visits to harm reduction organizations in New York City, guest lectures, and research/oral history analysis. This course has been approved for inclusion in both the African-American Studies and History undergraduate curricula (majors and concentrators).

Working from the notion that sport is “more than a game,” the class will examine the social, cultural and political impact of sports in a variety of American contexts in the past and present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the thrust of the course encourages students to consider sports in local, national, and transnational contexts.  The guiding questions of the course are: What is the relationship between sport and society? How does sport inform political struggles within and across national borders? How does sport reinforce and/or challenge social hierarchies? Can sport provide visions of alternative conceptions of the self and community? Throughout the semester, we will examine such topics as: the continuing political struggles surrounding mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup, the role of professional baseball in the rise and fall of Jim Crow segregation, the contradictory impact of high school football in Texas, the centrality of tennis to the women’s movement in the United States, and the role of sports in the growth of the city of Los Angeles.

Students will become acquainted with the key methodological approaches to writing the history of an “age” and scrutinize their usefulness in the process, including traditional social history models, cultural anthropology, and more recent theories of age as a performance. The course traces thematic topics which adhere to a linear chronology, beginning with Roman comedy in the second century BCE and ending with the death and divinization of Hadrian’s favorite, the Bithynian youth, Antinous in 130 CE. The class will make substantial use of Columbia’s resources at Butler Library, including an ancient world research methods session at the library itself, as well as at least one “hands-on” session with the Roman epigraphic, papyrologicial, and numismatic material in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Our proximity to The Metropolitan Museum of Art will also be utilized, both in terms of a class visit and in one component of the course assessment that will culminate in a class website, “The History of Roman Youth in Objects”.",Evan L Jewell,2:10pm,4:00pm,88697,Morningside,UN3050-20163-001,,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225192201/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3050-20163-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST UN3979,CHILDHOOD & POLICY IN EUR & US,"This course explores the relationship between changing perceptions of childhood and the development of social policies over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the United States and Europe. Conceiving of childhood as a social construct, rather than a fixed and biological stage of life, historians of childhood have focused on the experiences of children to understand how society perceives of itself and how it has been affected by economic, political, intellectual, and social shifts over time. In this course, we will ask what might explain similarities and differences in how childhood was perceived across regions and cultures? The course focuses on how various class, racial, and gender inequalities affected the material experience of children in the past and how these clashed with ideologies of childhood, examining whether it is possible for a child to 
not 
experience a childhood. We will also concentrate on the place of children in the emergence of welfare state programs, paying particular attention to the burgeoning influence of the medical and social sciences. We will ask: what is the relationship between children and the national community? What are some of the instrumental ways in which childhood was used to shape the values or norms of the citizenry? How did concerns about child protection, and tensions regarding the public or private responsibility for children’s well-being, shape the formation of social policy?",Anna K Danziger Halperin,12:10pm,2:00pm,84031,Morningside,UN3979-20163-001,,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225192328/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3979-20163-001/,301M Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HSEA GU4842,EAST ASIA IN THE LONG COLD WAR,"This course charts the history of East Asia in the long Cold War, from 1945 to contemporary developments, focusing mainly on China, Japan and Korea, with occasional forays into Southeast Asia. What we term the “Cold War” from a narrowly Western perspective had remarkable peculiarities in the East Asian context. Not only was it actually “hot”, with frequent and bloody escalations of violence, but its chronological boundaries were, and still are, more fluid than in the United States or Europe. For East Asian countries, political forces and peoples, the Cold War was not only, and often not primarily, a global contest between two superpowers and/or ideologies. It was a struggle to redefine themselves and their place in the world after the collapse of colonial empires – European and Japanese – and during the rise of Soviet and American imperial hegemonies. This task began on the very day Japan admitted defeat, August 15th 1945. Growing American and Soviet influence and rivalry in the region profoundly reshuffled power relations, but local actors at different scales used the superpowers for their own purposes as much as they supported them. China challenged the bipolar order as early as 1960. Lastly, the dissolution of the USSR did not entail the demise of Communist regimes in Beijing and Pyongyang (or Hanoi), nor a reunification between the two Koreas and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,13655,Morningside,GU4842-20163-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160907052049/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/GU4842-20163-001/,408 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

HSEA GU4888,WOMEN & GENDER IN KOREAN HIST,"While the rise of women's history and feminist theory in the 1960s and 1970s fostered more general reevaluations of social and cultural history in the West, such progressions have been far more modest in Korean history. To introduce one of the larger challenges in current Korean historiography, this course explores the experiences, consciousness and representations of women Korea at home and abroad from premodern times to the present. Historical studies of women and gender in Korea will be analyzed in conjunction with theories of Western women's history to encourage new methods of rethinking ""patriarchy"" within the Korean context. By tracing the lives of women from various socio-cultural aspects and examining the multiple interactions between the state, local community, family and individual, women's places in the family and in society, their relationships with one another and men, and the evolution of ideas about gender and sexuality throughout Korea's complicated past will be reexamined through concrete topics with historical specificity and as many primary sources as possible. With understanding dynamics of women's lives in Korean society, this class will build an important bridge to understand the construction of New Women in early twentieth-century Korea, when women from all walks of life had to accommodate their ""old-style"" predecessors and transform themselves to new women, as well as the lives of contemporary Korean women. This will be very much a reading-and-discussion course. Lectures will review the readings in historical perspective and supplement them.

The underlying assumptions are that disease, and the ways we define disease, are simultaneously reflections of social and cultural values, as well as important factors in shaping those values. Also, it is maintained that the environments that we build determine the ways we live and die. The dread infectious and acute diseases in the nineteenth century, the chronic, degenerative conditions of the twentieth and the new, vaguely understood conditions rooted in a changing chemical and human-made environment are emblematic of the societies we created. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How does the health status of Americans reflect and shape our history? How do ideas about health reflect broader attitudes and values in American history and culture? How does the American experience with pain, disability, and disease affect our actions and lives? What are the responsibilities of the state and of the individual in preserving health?

For undergraduates only. This course is required for all undergraduate students majoring in IE, OR:EMS, OR:FE and OR.  This class must be taken during (or before) the fifth semester. This course introduces students to operations research and stochastic processes. Operations research is concerned with quantitative decision problems, generally involving the allocation and control of limited resources, often in the presence of significant uncertainty. Stochastic processes are collections of random variables, usually indexed by time. In stochastic process models, time can be regarded as either discrete or continuous. For example, we might use stochastic processes to model the evolution of a stock price over time, the damage claims received by an insurance company over time, the work-in-process inventory in a factory over time or the number of calls waiting in a telephone call center over time, all of which evolve with considerable uncertainty. Among the stochastic processes to be considered are discrete-time Markov chains, random walks, continuous-time Markov chains, Poisson processes, birth-and-death processes, renewal processes, renewal-reward processes, Brownian motion and geometric Brownian motion. Among the engineering applications to be considered are queuing, inventory and finance. IEOR E3106 must be completed by the fifth term. Only students with special academic circumstances may be allowed to take these courses in alternative semesters with the consultation of CSA and Departmental advisors.",,,,11841,Morningside,E3106-20163-R01,STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS AND APPLICA,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623044324/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IEOR/E3106-20163-R01/,,,"Columbia College

We show how firms should take into account the cost of capital, budgets, taxes, depreciation, inflation, and uncertainty, in order to decide which projects to undertake, reject, or postpone. This course is a good preparation for positions in investment banking, consulting, private equity, venture capital, corporate finance, and construction management, and for entrepreneurs.

IEOR E4573,TOPICS IN OR,"DAPME-Lab is an intensive project-based seminar in which students will learn and apply a multi-disciplinary approach to front-end and product design, strategy formulation and implementation, and agile application of tech-driven concepts in actual business settings. Taught by Prof. R.A. Farrokhnia, this course focuses on the practical development and execution of inventive design-centric solutions coupled with deep industrial, operational, and business analyses. Various topics in industrial product and web design as well as UX and UI will be discussed in interactive and collaborative lectures. Additional topics will include Scrum, Kanban, and the dynamics of entrepreneurial/venture-capital financing relevant to technical (co-)founders. Guest speakers, field trips, and interaction with domain experts will augment course curriculum and exercises. Class projects will encompass working with a Fortune 500 corporation as well as an entrepreneurial portfolio company of a prominent Venture Capital firm in New York (projects have been vetted and facilitated by the course faculty) - the class will also contribute to social good by working on a short project of a New York-based small or non-for-profit business (total of 3 class projects). Such endeavors will integrate classroom learning with best practices in lean startups, product development, team management, and business planning. Throughout the term, assigned teams will engage in Product Design Sprint and Agile Development, working on all aspects of exploration, ideation, design, refinement, prototype buildup, and validation. Acting as innovation-driven management consultants, teams will work simultaneously on engineering and tech-driven briefs (including field-testing) that would address real-life business challenges. The aim of the course is to ultimately empower students with the necessary skills and toolsets to transform a concept into a functional, well-designed, and value-add product. Students will be evaluated on a number of criteria, including individually on class and project-participation, collectively on team project performance, and quality and depth of teams' final presentations (no midterm or final exams). This course has limited enrollment by application, and will require the signing of Non-Disclosure Agreement for class projects. Proficiency in math, statistics, coding, and/or database management/analysis are recommended for admission consideration.

IEOR E4998,MANAG TECH INNOV & ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"This is a required course for undergraduate students majoring in OR:EMS. Managing Technological Innovation offers a principles-based approach to identifying, analyzing, and attacking high-growth markets. Students will learn to examine and analyze novel business problems in nascent industries with billion dollar potential. Lectures will focus on rational market analysis, separating signal from noise, executing sound decision-making processes in the startup context, and venture market psychology. The class will be a mix of case studies, lectures, guest speakers from the startup community, and in-class discussions. Grading will be based on class participation, case analyses, and longer group papers. Student will be expected to contribute thoughtful, well-reasoned, and clearly elucidated comments to discussions. In return for your attention and effort, you will have the chance to discuss real-world business problems with some of New York's most successful technology entrepreneurs and investors. Past guests have included founders and investors from AppNexus, Codecademy, BankSimple, Betterment, GroupMe, MongoDb, Razorfish, Union Square Ventures, IA Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Founder Collective. This class is taught by two working professionals, and we expect the same quality of effort and attention to detail from our students as we would from anyone who works with us. There are no formal prerequisites, but knowledge and interest in the startup world, some knowledge about how small businesses are run, and the ability to write and communicate clearly will be important to do well.",Gerard A Neumann,10:10am,12:40pm,75616,Morningside,E4998-20163-001,MANAG TECH INNOV & ENTREPRENSP,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623044704/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IEOR/E4998-20163-001/,To be announced,,"Columbia College

In particular, students will explore the methodologies and techniques as they relate to cost-benefit analysis with a special focus on hands-on problems and experiences.  Each lecture is structured in two parts: theory/methodology in the first half of each class and application of the learned concepts through an analysis of case studies in the second half. Case studies will cover various applications of CBA as it relates to infrastructure (not general public policy issues as those are addressed in other courses).  Examples of such case studies are transit investments in the US, water and wastewater infrastructure improvements, electricity grid upgrades or airport expansions. Case studies will cover both the US and developing country contexts. 
 Throughout the semester students will be expected to complete a cost-benefit analysis in the form of a group project.  The project will consist of all important components of such an analysis such as a literature review, methodology section, description of project scenarios to be evaluated, compilation and monetization of the main costs and benefits, development of an Excel model including discounting and sensitivity analyses.  The quantitative analysis and estimation of benefits and costs will be critical and require students to be familiar with spreadsheet applications and formulas in Microsoft Excel.  Working with actual project and performance data will be required as much as is feasible in each case.",Alexander Heil,6:10pm,8:00pm,81548,Morningside,U6116-20163-001,INFRASTRUCTURE COST-BENEFIT AN,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161110132853/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/U6116-20163-001/,404 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,T,20163INAF6116U001,LECTURE

This course is intended to accelerate the evolution of Investment in Social Change by looking at the ways these disciplines must work together to craft social innovation. Students will apply formal reasoning to an inherently subjective field, and should leave the course better prepared to (a) balance the dual mandate of return and social change within their own endeavors; (b) understand the economic principles of technology-led innovation as a key catalyst linking public and private efforts for social change; and (c) contribute to public policy frameworks that encourage private investment in the public good.",Christopher M Reim,6:10pm,8:00pm,94692,Morningside,U6138-20163-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161222193734/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/U6138-20163-001/,405 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,M,20163INAF6138U001,SEMINAR

INAF U6827,METHODS FOR DEVELOPMENT PRAC,"This course is the first part of a two-course sequence for advanced students concentrating in Economic and Political Development. The second part is the Workshop in Development Practice (SIPA U9001). These courses are integrated into a year-long encounter with the actual practice of development. The course seeks to help students develop a conceptual and critical understanding of some of the key tools and approaches employed by organizations in development practice, and to skill students in using these approaches and tools in a discerning, ethical and effective manner that recognizes their shortcomings and limitations. The course takes a hands-on approach and promotes learning by doing. Questions of ""Whose development? Whose priorities and agenda? Whose proposed solutions and strategies?"" are ever present in choosing development approaches and outcomes. Development work, to the extent it involves development organizations and workers entering as external agents of change into a national arena or local community, is an intensely political exercise. What has changed in the course of development practice is that development workers increasingly perceive themselves less as direct agents of change - delivering top-down transfers of knowledge and resources from those who know best or have more, to those in need or who need to be influenced - and more as facilitators of change. According to this approach, the development worker seeks to act as a medium and partner in identifying local needs and priorities, and helping to translate these into equitable and sustainable development outcomes through knowledge-sharing, empowerment, capacity building and/or additional resources. However, this transition has been uneven, and externally-driven, top-down approaches persist. Development workers also need to be continually aware of the values, assumptions and biases that they bring to their interactions with local actors and that are implicit in the approaches and tools that they use. With needs, priorities and agendas contested across many levels and sets of interests, the job of a development worker is a complex and responsible one. To that end, this course also challenges students to reflect on their goals and desired approaches in their future roles as development agents.
 Registration in this course requires an application. Priority will be given to second-year EPD students. Apply at:

JAZZ W4920,JAZZ & CINEMA,"Because the beginnings of jazz and film both date to the last years of the nineteenth century, the two art forms essentially grew up together.  The history of both is inseparable from the technological revolutions of the twentieth century, and at least in the United States, from histories of racial representation.  We will explore the racial issues raised by American films along with how filmmakers represent gender, American humor, discourses of art and the popular, and the conventions of narrative.  We will pay special attention to how all of this changes dramatically throughout the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.  After establishing what is most American about jazz and cinema, we will move on to documentary films as well as to films from Europe where many of the dominant American myths about jazz are both perpetuated and transformed. The goal of the course is to understand jazz as a music as well as a cultural practice that has been in constant flux during the last 120 years.  The representation of the music and its practitioners in cinema is crucial to an understanding of the music at each of its many cultural moments.",Krin Gabbard,10:10am,11:25am,68097,Morningside,W4920-20163-001,,"Jazz Studies, Center for",JAZZ,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161226224142/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/JAZZ/W4920-20163-001/,516 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

Haitian Kreyòl is spoken by Haiti’s population of nine million and by about one million Haitians in the U.S. Including over 190,000 in the New York City area. In fact, New York City has the second largest population of Kreyòl Speakers after Port--au--Prince, Haiti’s capital. Through this course, you will develop introductory speaking, reading, and writing skills. We use a communicative approach, balanced with grammatical and phonetic techniques. Classroom and textbook materials are complemented by work with film, radio, and especially music (konpa, rasin, twoubadou, rap, raga, levanjil, vodou tradisyonèl, etc.), as well as with visits to city museums and institutions related to Haiti.

PEPM U6102,MICROECONOMICS & PUBLIC POLICY,"To design and manage successful economic policy professionals need a sophisticated command of modern microeconomics. This course strengthens and extends understanding of microeconomic theory, and gives practice applying it. We study the relationship between market structure and market performance, exploring conditions under which policy intervention can improve market performance, and when it can be counter-productive. Both distributional and efficiency aspects of intervention are stressed.

PHIL GR5010,ADDICTION AND AGENCY,"It is commonly believed that one cannot be blamed for actions that one is compelled to perform. Addiction is often taken to be an archetypical; case of a condition that can compel actions. But what is addiction? Is there a principled division between paradigmatic addictive behaviors such as heroin use and, e.g., excessive cell phone use? The answers to questions like these turn out to be highly controversial. Drawing on psychiatric as well as philosophical literatures, we will seek an analysis of the concept of addiction that can illuminate its moral significance. We will conclude by discussing arguments for skepticism about responsibility judgments more broadly. According to such arguments, none of us are responsible for anything, not because responsible action is incompatible with determinism, but because there is no principled explanation for why addicts would fail to be responsible which not overgeneralize to non-addicts.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,87530,Morningside,GR5010-20163-001,,Philosophy,PHIL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160906060542/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHIL/GR5010-20163-001/,501 International Affairs Building,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

PHIL UN3860,CONTESTS BETWEEN TRAGEDY&PHIL;,"Prerequisites: Intended for students with some background in Philosophy 
 This course explores philosophical questions that lie at the heart of an 'ancient quarrel' between philosophy and tragedy. We will pursue some ways in which ancient and modern philosophers struggle with and against views in ancient tragedies of human nature, the significance of suffering, and the shape and limits of our ethical lives. Our guiding questions revolve around the themes of freedom and the emotions: what role does fate or chance play in shaping how our lives go? What sort of choice must we be able to make to act freely? Do emotions such as grief and anger disrupt or promote the integrity of our identities, relationships, and communities? How should we relate to forces - supernatural, natural, psychological - that are not up to us, above all the facts of suffering and death? Might the philosophical pursuit of freedom evade an inescapable tragic dimension of llfe? We will explore competing answers to, and different literary styles of reflecting on, these and other questions between philosophy and tragedy. Ancient authors include Plato, Aristotle, Epictetus, Seneca, Sophocles, and Euripides, before we examine some influential, more recent philosophical encounters with tragedy by Hegel, Nietzsche, Iris Murdoch, Martha Nussbaum, and Stanley Cavell.",Jonathan D Fine,12:10pm,2:00pm,97196,Morningside,UN3860-20163-001,,Philosophy,PHIL,http://culpa.info/professors/13124,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160907232349/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHIL/UN3860-20163-001/,309 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

 Race and Modern Political Thought is a Political Theory colloquium that explores how the concept of race became available to modern thought as a legitimate conceptualization of human being and difference and to political thought as an idea useful to structuring political communities.  Is race best understood in ideological terms, i.e., as a viewpoint shared by philosophers and lay-persons alike about difference that usefully reflected the needs and aspirations of slaveholders and colonialists?  Or is race instead an artifact of modern forms of reasoning?  Or should we ignore questions of origin and simply take seriously the notion that the only practical—ethically correct or politically progressive—approach to theorizing race is to attend critically to the organization of racial power?   What kind of idea is race?",Michelle R Smith,4:10pm,6:00pm,06291,Barnard College,BC3102-20163-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/12308,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915050513/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/BC3102-20163-001/,302 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

POLS BC3501,COLL: URBAN VIOLENCE,"Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent 
 One of the key contemporary challenges for democracy and development across both the developing and developed worlds is urban violence. From urban gangs to paramilitaries to vigilantes to citizen defense committees, the city is increasing a key setting for a range of armed actors that engage in equally diverse forms of criminality and the exercise of coercive force. Major cities throughout the world thus lead two lives: as control and command centers in a globalized (and urbanized) economy, and as the stages where the monopoly over the legitimate use of violence that Max Weber identified as a defining attribute of the state is contested on a daily basis. This course has two overarching objectives. The first objective is to examine and critically assess existing theories of the drivers, functions, and consequences of urban crime and violence.  The second objective is to situate existing research within a broader range of classic and emerging political science research on state building, institutions, democracy,  development, and conflict. The methodological emphasis of the course is comparative analysis, and therefore empirical material will largely draw on analyses of crime and violence in Latin America and Africa, and the United States. This course will introduce students to the key theories, debates, and empirical studies of urban crime and violence. Students who successfully complete the class will: 1.      Acquire a broad knowledge of the theories and concepts used to analyze urban crime and violence. 2.      Develop a theoretically informed and empirically grounded understanding of both historical and contemporary trends in crime and violence in major cities across Latin America, Africa, and the United States. 3.      Draw linkages between news coverage of urban crime and violence and political science theories on a range of broader issues regarding state building, institutions, democracy, and development. 4.      Use existing theories to analyze, assess, and present empirical data, both written and verbal.   5.      Produce a major, original research paper that advances existing knowledge of the origins, dynamics, and/or consequences of urban crime and violence.",Eduardo Moncada,10:10am,12:00pm,06187,Barnard College,BC3501-20163-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/13459,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915050520/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/BC3501-20163-001/,227 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

POLS GR4132,POLIT THOUGHT-CLASSICL & MEDVL,"Prerequisites: Contemporary Civilization or a comparable introduction to political theory course. 
 In this course, we will read classical and medieval writings that span multiple linguistic, historic and religious contexts. The goal is to explore similar notions of the just world that span these varied writings, from Plato's Republic to Zoroastrian and Early Islamic writings on just rule. Such similarities will highlight how some of these works represent cultural amalgams that blend Greek, Persian and Arabic elements. Yet, we will also consider how these writings differ and how their authors constructed them to respond to their unique political concerns. Throughout this course, we will consider how authors drew upon their foreign status, as aliens, outsiders, or clients to conquering tribes, to transform politics. And we will ask why these authors invoke and re-imagine particular models of the just world to represent their ideal notions of sovereignty, equity and justice. In the end, we will question how the foreign roots of ancient and medieval thought can help us fathom the basic underpinnings of founding documents today.",Giovanni Giorgini,10:10am,11:25am,13346,Morningside,GR4132-20163-001,,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160825193304/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GR4132-20163-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

Records of the Federal Convention
, mainly based on the notes that James Madison took during the Convention. (Passages from this work will be assigned later.) The purpose of the seminar is partly to illuminate the nature of constitutions and of constitution-making more generally, and partly to identify causal mechanisms that can explain the choices that were made at the Convention. Theories of collective action, of bargaining and of deliberation will have a central place. We shall not study the process of ratification of the Constitution, except to the extent that the framers' anticipation of the ratifying conventions constrained their choices. Nor shall we draw heavily on 
The Federalist Papers
, except when they illuminate the sometimes cryptic statements in Madison's notes.

In analyzing political representation in the region, it focuses on demands for political inclusion by different actors and how they were resisted or accepted by established elites in a process that moved from regime change to electoral rotation in power. The course covers these political dynamics and their institutional consequences since the onset of the twentieth century, starting with the Mexican Revolution, until the contemporary period where democracy is the predominant form of government and elections a crucial tool for social and political change. While analyzing the politics of Latin America, we will cover important political science concepts associated with democratic representation, social inclusion and the rule of the law, such as social movement mobilization, political regime change, presidentialism, political party systems, political identities, state capacity, and institutional weakness.",Maria Victoria Murillo,10:10am,11:25am,68378,Morningside,GU4461-20163-001,,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160825201458/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4461-20163-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS UN3190,REPUBLICANISM: PLATO TO PETTIT,"The course is divided into two main parts. The first half examines features of classical republicanism and its developments from Greece and Rome up to the late eighteenth century. We will analyze the relationship between ethics and politics, the significance of the mixed constitution, the problem of political instability, the role of character in political action, and the relationship between virtuous citizens, good arms and good laws. The second half will be more issue-based, as we will examine the resurgence of republicanism in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, in part as a critique of liberal democracy. We will explore the efforts to define ""republican"" freedom, the relationship between equality and freedom (and the challenges posed by the market and inequality in resources), the relationship between republicanism and democracy, and the role and nature of civic virtue. The class will end with consideration of recent efforts on the part of some political theorists to redefine patriotism or loyalty to one's particular state in the modern world and to think about what republicanism might require on a global scale.",Jessica L Kimpell,6:10pm,7:25pm,23861,Morningside,UN3190-20163-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/12028,silver,5.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160825201528/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/UN3190-20163-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

POLS UN3220,LOGIC OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE,"Much of politics is about combining individual preferences or actions into collective choices. We will make use of two theoretical approaches. Our primary approach will be social choice theory, which studies how we aggregate what individuals want into what the collective “wants.” The second approach, game theory, covers how we aggregate what individuals want into what the group gets, given that social, economic, and political outcomes usually depend on the interaction of individual choices. The aggregation of preferences or choices is usually governed by some set of institutional rules, formal or informal. Our main themes include the rationality of individual and group preferences, the underpinnings and implications of using majority rule, tradeoffs between aggregation methods, the fairness of group choice, the effects of institutional constraints on choice (e.g., agenda control), and the implications for democratic choice. Most of the course material is highly abstract, but these abstract issues turn up in many real-world problems, from bargaining between the branches of government to campus elections to judicial decisions on multi-member courts to the allocation of relief funds among victims of natural disasters to the scoring of Olympic events. The collective choice problem is one faced by society as a whole and by the smallest group alike.",Jeffrey R Lax,11:40am,12:55pm,65705,Morningside,UN3220-20163-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/2482,,32.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161117095722/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/UN3220-20163-001/,602 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

Students will use economic modes of analysis to draw comparisons both within and across a diverse set of nations ranging from established democracies like the U.S. to nascent democracies like Afghanistan. The main focus will be on how the incentives facing individuals drive differences in economic development, democratic representation and voter participation in both developed and developing contexts. Starting at the level of national political systems, before analyzing the internal workings of institutions and the behavior of voters that underpin democratic systems, students will grapple with major contemporary debates including. The course will familiarize students with central political economy concepts—such as credible commitment, rent-seeking, electoral accountability and the collective action problem—as well as frontier empirical findings and methods shaping how we think about the interrelation of politics and economics. These powerful concepts and tools will empower students to think analytically, analyze macro phenomena in terms of micro-level incentives, and apply theoretical frameworks to answer specific questions in this course and beyond.

PORT W3325,"SLAVERY,FREE LABOR,CULTRL MEM","This course will examine the historical period of gradual emancipation to free labor in Brazil. Course readings include literary and cultural production as well as historical narratives and literary theory. We will question how ideas of racial labor transform alongside new notions of freedom and nation. By drawing mostly on literature, history, and film, this course investigates the issue of cultural memory as related to the history of slavery, racial formation, and national forgetting. Our course discussions will center on questions as, how is the history of slavery remembered or forgotten? How do we ethically remember a past that we can never understand completely? Is it possible to separate cultural representations of race, ethnicity, sexuality and gender from their political and economic contexts? How are “race,” “liberty,” “property” and “life” understood during slavery, and how do those ideas continue to influence the post-slavery nation? Although the course will focus heavily on the Brazilian historical context, we will also comparatively examine how these histories are remembered and forgotten in the U.S. and other parts of Latin America.",Ana P Lee,1:10pm,2:25pm,66547,Morningside,W3325-20163-001,,Spanish and Portuguese,PORT,http://localhost:8801/professors/13873,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623190548/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PORT/W3325-20163-001/,206 Casa Hispánica,,"Barnard

PUAF U6033,DECISION MODELS & MANAGEMENT,"This course provides an introduction to computer-based models for decision-making. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, accounting, operations, and marketing. Applications will include advertising planning, revenue management, asset-liability management, environmental policy modeling, portfolio optimization, and corporate risk management, among others. The aim of the course is to help students become intelligent consumers of these methods. To this end, the course will cover the basic elements of modeling -- how to formulate a model and how to use and interpret the information a model produces. The course will attempt to instill a critical viewpoint towards decision models, recognizing that they are powerful but limited tools.The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces. Thirty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked ""experts only.""

Supervised learning deals with prediction problems where the outcome variable is known such as predicting a price of a house in a certain neighborhood or an outcome of a congressional race.

REGN U6410,SOCIAL MOVEMENTS & CITIZENSHIP IN AFRICA,"This course focuses on social movements and citizenship in sub-Saharan Africa to examine how people form political and social movements and deploy citizenship strategies within social, historical, and economic structures that are both local and global. It draws on readings and lectures from scholars in history, political science, anthropology, sociology, and African studies to explore the following topics and themes: histories and theories of social movements and citizenship; cities and social movements and citizenship; citizenship outside the nation-state; social movements and democracy; citizenship as a creative enterprise that emphasizes claim-making and improvisation; citizenship within imperial, international, and national contexts; infrastructures, claim-making, and coalition building; opposition, leadership and democracy; and social movements of African youth and women. This course features guest lectures by and discussions with French and American scholars from Sciences-Po, Universite Paris 1, NYU, and Columbia, and is part of the Joint African Studies Program (JASP) at the Institute of African Studies that is supported by the Partnership University Fund (PUF) and the French Alliance Program at Columbia. It includes foundational readings on concepts, theories, and histories of social movements and citizenship in Africa as well as in-depth case studies on selective themes by various experts working on sub-Saharan Africa. It is unique insofar as it offers a strong foundation in social movements and citizenship while exposing students to in-depth case studies by leading experts working in a variety of disciplines and geographical contexts.

By using readings and presentations produced by Romanian specialists, we aim to be able to see the culture with an ""insider's eye"", as much as we can.

RUSS GU4155,HIST OF RUSSIAN/SOVIET FILM,"The aesthetic innovations and theoretical explorations of Russian and Soviet film culture constitute one of the richest traditions in world cinema. At the same time, Russian and Soviet cinema provides a unique lens through which to view the tumultuous changes that took place throughout Russia during the twentieth century. We will study a wide variety of Russian films from the pre-revolutionary era; the exciting, world-renowned decade of radical cinematic experimentation in the twenties; the periods of Socialist Realism, WWII, the Thaw, Stagnation, and 
Perestroika
; and, finally, we will look at how these various aesthetic and ideological approaches to filmmaking inform the cinema and media practices of the post-Soviet era. Directors include: Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein, Abram Room, Dziga Vertov, Vasiliev Brothers, Grigory Alexandrov, Mikhail Kalatozov, Leonid Gaidai, Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergei Parajanov, Mikita Mikhalkov, Aleksei German, Andrei Zviagintsev, and others. We will also consider the vital contributions of Russian and Soviet film theorists to the global discourse of film studies, reading the theoretical works of Eisenstein, Vertov, Kuleshov, Pudovkin, Tarkovsky and others within their historical and cultural contexts. The course will also address innovations and advances in film style that originated in the film culture of non-Russian territories and republics.",Edward J Tyerman,6:10pm,10:00pm,05167,Barnard College,GU4155-20163-001,,Slavic Languages @Barnard,RUSS,http://localhost:8801/professors/6136,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161016153454/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RUSS/GU4155-20163-001/,307 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

SDEV W2320,ECON & FIN MTHDS FOR SDEV,"Prerequisites: Principles of Economics and one semester of calculus. 
 The objective of this course is to introduce students to the skills and methods necessary to understand and evaluate the economic and financial aspects of sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will compare competing objectives and policies through the prism of economic & financial reasoning. Environmental economics and finance are broad areas covering all the multi-faceted and complex interactions between the economic system and the natural environment. Financial markets are the primary source of signals used to direct economic activity in a capitalist global economy. Economic activity is the primary determinant of the quality and sustainability of the natural environment. Students interested in sustainable development who are unfamiliar with economics and who do not develop a facility with economic and financial concepts are severely handicapped in their efforts to increase the level of environmental responsibility embedded in economic activity. This course is intended to provide students with a flying introduction to key analytical concepts required to understand topics in environmental economics and finance and to introduce them to selected topics within the field. The first part of the course (the Analytical Toolbox) is designed to provide a set of portable skills for two sets of students: a) those who will work in fields specifically devoted to sustainable development who, as part of their work, will need to engage with sources of economic & financial information and with discourses where sustainable development is not a focus; and b) students who may end up following careers in organizations where sustainability is not the primary objective. The topics and readings in the second part of the course were chosen to facilitate a critical engagement with the broad intellectual framework underlying sustainable development from the perspective of economics and finance. The topics are intended to create a community of intellectual discourse on sustainable development that will spill over beyond the classroom to the conversations of students and alumni that will far outlive graduation. Offered in the Fall.",Satyajit Bose,2:40pm,3:55pm,16037,Morningside,W2320-20163-001,,Earth Institute,SDEV,http://culpa.info/professors/3069,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161211130242/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SDEV/W2320-20163-001/,327 Seeley W.

SDEV W3390,GIS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMNT,"This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of theoretical concepts underlying GIS systems and to give students a strong set of practical skills to use GIS for sustainable development research. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a system of computer software, data and analysis methods used to create, store, manage, digital information that allow us to create maps and dynamic models to analyze the physical and social processes of the world. Through a mixture of lectures, readings, focused discussions, and hands-on exercises, students will acquire an understanding of the variety and structure of spatial data and databases, gain knowledge of the principles behind raster and vector based spatial analysis, and learn basic cartographic principles for producing maps that effectively communicate a message. Student will also learn to use newly emerging web based mapping tools such as Google Earth, Google Maps and similar tools to develop on-line interactive maps and graphics. The use of other geospatial technologies such as the Global Positioning System will also be explored in this class. Case studies examined in class will draw examples from a wide ranges of GIS applications developed to assist in the development, implementation and evaluation of sustainable development projects and programs. On completion of the course, students will: 1. use a variety of GIS software programs to create maps and reports; 2. develop a sound knowledge of methods to search, obtain, and evaluate a wide variety of spatial data resources; 3. develop skills needed to determine best practices for managing spatial data resources; 4. use GIS to analyze the economic, social and environmental processes underlying the concept of building a sustainable world; 5. Gain an understanding of the limits of these technologies and make assessments of uncertainty associated with spatial data and spatial analysis models.

SDEV W3400,HUMAN POPULATIONS & SDEV,"Population processes and their outcomes in terms of population size and distribution have a fundamental role in sustainable development and also broad policy implications. This course will introduce students to the scientific study of human populations as a contribution toward understanding social structure, relations, and dynamics, as well as society-nature interactions. The aim is to offer a basic introduction to the main theories, concepts, measures, and uses of demography. The course will cover the issues of population size, distribution and composition, and consumption, at different scales from global to regional to local, as well as the implications for population-environment relationships. It will also address the fundamental demographic processes of mortality, fertility and migration, including their trends and transitions, We will consider these topics in the context of economic development, sustainability and cultural change. The course will also include an overview of basic demographic techniques and tools used for identifying, managing, analyzing and interpreting population data, and an introduction to population projections. Lab sessions will supplement readings and lectures by enabling students to explore data sources, calculate rates, and graphically represent demographic data.

SDEV W3410,URBANIZATION & SUSTAINABILITY,"The first decade of the 21st century marked the first time in human history when more of world’s population  lived in urban as distinct from rural places. It is impossible to achieve sustainable development in a physical, social or economic manner absent an understanding of the powerful and interdependent relationship between these concepts of sustainability and urbanization. This course explores this vital nexus. Students will gain a more detailed understanding of the ways in which urban life provides opportunities and challenges for addressing climate change, access to water and energy efficiency, among other topics. The intention is to provide students majoring in Sustainable Development with an historic and contemporary understanding of the connections between the process of urbanization that now dominates the world and the range of ways in which that process, directly and indirectly, shapes the challenge of sustainable development.

SIPA U6007,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT FOR PUB SERVICE ORG,"How can a nonprofit or public sector organization “be successful?” What does it take to achieve your mission? How should your organization be structured to be most effective? How do you deal with the loss of a major grant, the entrance of a new competitor, or a radical change in the political or funding landscape? How should you motivate your staff and sustain and grow your organization’s leadership? 
 In order to deal effectively with these challenges, managers need to acquire knowledge and skills in strategic management. These include conceptual and leadership skills such as the ability to accurately read change in the external environment, define and redefine organizational purpose, handle the complex trade-offs between demand for services and resource constraints, manage ongoing relationships and partnerships with other groups, maintain the commitment and productivity of employees, and guide the organization toward continuous improvement of service production and delivery systems to meet client needs. In other words, managers need deep knowledge of how to think, decide, and act strategically, both in organizational affairs and in matters affecting their capacity for leadership. 
 Strategic Management aims to prepare current and future managers of public service organizations for leadership roles by focusing on the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes needed to manage public service organizations strategically.",Erin Gore,11:00am,12:50pm,27399,Morningside,U6007-20163-001,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT:PUB SERV,International and Public Affairs,SIPA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161228083238/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SIPA/U6007-20163-001,404 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,R,20163SIPA6007U001,LECTURE

 This course will work retrospectively through the transatlantic Hispanic tradition, analyzing essays, poems, novels and movies that locate themselves against the larger structure of an empire (be it US, British or Spanish) and its corresponding webs of translation and trade. While ""travel writing"" in the Hispanic tradition has long included accounts of the New World written back to Spanish readers, we will examine other vectors as well: texts written back to the New World by American travelers in Europe, Spanish and Spanish American impressions of the burgeoning US empire, and textual and cinematic attempts to position the local within a global community of observers, readers and/or viewers. Central topics include the manipulation of the trope of civilization vs. barbarity, the peripheral critique of global capitalism, the question of local vs. universal perspectives on culture, and, above all, the aesthetic and political agendas that further (and are furthered by) the notion of cosmopolitanism, that ""placeless place"" (in the words of Camilla Fojas) ""that remains to be thought.",Ronald D Briggs,2:10pm,4:00pm,03982,Barnard College,BC3990-20163-001,,Spanish and Latin American Culture,SPAN,http://culpa.info/professors/4850,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045949/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SPAN/BC3990-20163-001/,502 Diana Center,,"Barnard

SPAN UN3991,SENIOR SEMINAR,"Iberian Globalization ,  How to study the current process designated as “globalization” from the perspective of Early Modern times? How to construct a corpus of sources and ideas on such a relevant topic? Between the 15th and the 17th centuries, with the expansion projects of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in Africa, Asia, America, and Europe itself, one “conquest” became more crucial than any other ––retaking the words of the philosopher Martin Heidegger, this was “the conquest of the world as an image.” Much earlier than Heidegger, in the late 16th century, the Spanish Jesuit José de Acosta had expressed this idea in an even more palpable way: the world could now be (visually and symbolically) “embraced.”,  The process of conquering the world as an image and embracing it with one’s eyes closed was accompanied, however, by myriad challenges: not only mapping the new extension of the empire and updating the information in the Padrón Real from Seville, but also relying on a panoply of local representations of the territories produced from afar; not only exporting the Spanish and the Portuguese languages as a key for the expansion of the empire (as Antonio de Nebrija pointed out in 1492), but also learning local languages (Nahuatl, Maya, Chinese, Japanese, Tupí, Tamil, etc.); not only globalizing European imagery through prints and objects brought to the four parts of the world, but facing the transformation of art histories which had remained, until then, mostly autonomous; not only converting neophytes to Christianity, but innovating conversion techniques and debating on their efficacy; not only recording and depicting the flora and fauna encountered in new lands, but transforming the written and visual taxonomies through which unknown specimens could be described.,  In this senior seminar we will study a great variety of primary sources to configure a possible “corpus” of research in the field of Iberian globalization: maps drawn or printed from New Spain, Perú, China, or the Philippines (the Relaciones Geográficas or the Mercedes maps, and Matteo Ricci’s or Guaman Poma de Ayala’s world maps); objects and images painted and carved in the most novel materials (corn paste, feathers, mother-of-pearl, lacquer, sandal paste, etc.); conversion books and dictionaries aimed to facilitate the process of Christianization (the Franciscan Diego Valadés’s Rhetorica Christiana or the Jesuit João Rodrigues’s conceptualization of Japanese language); books of natural history on Mexican",Alessandra Russo,2:10pm,4:00pm,74836,Morningside,UN3991-20163-001,,Spanish and Portuguese,SPAN,http://culpa.info/professors/3410,silver,5.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161012030144/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SPAN/UN3991-20163-001/,206 Casa Hispánica,,"Barnard

VIAR UN2200,CERAMICS I,"(Formerly R3130) This studio course will provide the students with a foundation in the ceramic process, its history, and its relevance to contemporary art making. The course is structured in two parts. The first centers on the fundamental and technical aspects of the material. Students will learn construction techniques, glazing and finishing methods, and particulars about firing procedures. This part of the course will move quickly in order to expose the students to a variety of ceramic processes. Weekly assignments, demonstrations, and lectures will be given. The second centers on the issue of how to integrate ceramics into the students' current practice.

. 
 (Formerly R3332) Sculpture III is an invitation for immersive sculpting. The class will explore the idea of experiences and construction of contexts as central research topics. The class becomes a laboratory space to explore various techniques to heighten body awareness and spatial sensibility. Through assignments and workshops, the students will practice how to digest these sensory experiences through their studio practice. Historical precedents for art outside the usual mediums and venues will be our reference points to investigate how our own work may take part in a generative process that evolves the definition of sculpture. The assignments in the first half of the semester point the students to performance, site specificity, and sound, that utilize New York City's odd spots and professionals. While building such common experiential platforms, the class will also build language for a dialogic space, through weekly in-class discussions lead by the instructor, guests, and rotating panels of the students. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from experiential learning to intensive studio work on a final project, where the students are asked to pay close attention to how various methods and fields of subjects combine. The resulting project has to be the best work you have ever done.

WMST BC3125,INTRO TO SEXUALITY STUDIES,"This introduction to sexuality studies is an examination of the historical origins, social functions, and conceptual limitations of the notion of “sexuality” as a domain of human experience and a field of power relations. Sexuality is often taken to be a natural and unchanging element of individual life. In this course, we seek to examine the ways in which sex is both social and political. We will consider how sexuality has been socially constructed, paying careful attention to the ways these ideas relate to other social forces such as gender, race, and class.",Alexander Pittman,11:40am,12:55pm,07495,Barnard College,BC3125-20163-001,,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,http://culpa.info/professors/13283,gold,9.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160915045201/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WMST/BC3125-20163-001/,LL104 Diana Center,,"Barnard

WMST UN3514,HIST APPROACHES TO FEM QUESTNS,"This class is an introduction to the debates on women that played a dominant role in both the philosophical and literary traditions of the European/Atlantic world from the classical period through the seventeenth-century. Beginning with the works of ancient political theory that actively debated women’s political, social, and ethical position in society (chiefly Aristotle, Plato, and Plutarch), the course will address the pan-European books of “Good Women” that served as exemplary case studies, the 
querelle des femmes
 (or debate on women) that dominated political and humanist discourse of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the crucial importance of the political analogies between the household and the state and the marital and social contracts in the premodern world (and, indeed, in our own).  We will study works from ancient Greece and Rome and medieval and early modern Italy, Spain, France, England, Ethiopia and Mexico, and topics ranging from domestic violence and political resistance theory to transvestitism and lesbianism.",Julie Crawford,2:10pm,4:00pm,22193,Morningside,UN3514-20163-001,,Women's and Gender Studies,WMST,http://culpa.info/professors/461,silver,20.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161225131926/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WMST/UN3514-20163-001/,754 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

How does the choice of literary genre inflect the presentation of gender? What characterized the corporeality of the medieval hero? How did writers depict themselves and the objects of their desire? When genitalia “speak for themselves,” as in some the medieval fabliaux we will read, what do they say and whose desire do they express? Which bodies are clearly gendered and why?

WRIT W2110,FICTION SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
The modern short story has gone through many transformations, and the innovations of its practitioners have often pointed the way for prose fiction as a whole. The short story has been seized upon and refreshed by diverse cultures and aesthetic affiliations, so that perhaps the only stable definition of the form remains the famous one advanced by Poe, one of its early masters, as a work of fiction that can be read in one sitting. Still, common elements of the form have emerged over the last century and this course will study them, including Point of View, Plot, Character, Setting, and Theme. John Hawkes once famously called these last four elements the ""enemies of the novel,"" and many short story writers have seen them as hindrances as well. Hawkes later recanted, though some writers would still agree with his earlier assessment, and this course will examine the successful strategies of great writers across the spectrum of short story practice, from traditional approaches to more radical solutions, keeping in mind how one period's revolution - Hemingway, for example - becomes a later era's mainstream or ""common-sense"" storytelling mode. By reading the work of major writers from a writer's perspective, we will examine the myriad techniques employed for what is finally a common goal: to make readers feel. Short writing exercises will help us explore the exhilarating subtleties of these elements and how the effects created by their manipulation or even outright absence power our most compelling fictions.",Rebecca J Curtis,4:10pm,6:00pm,60943,Morningside,W2110-20163-001,APPROACHES TO THE SHORT STORY,Writing,WRIT,http://localhost:8801/professors/3331,,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071610/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W2110-20163-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

In this seminar, we will examine works by several accomplished writers of fiction, and a few crackerjack poets, in order to determine what, precisely, we mean when we talk about irony on the page and what, precisely, we mean when we talk about earnestness. How are these very different effects (and affects) achieved? What are their benefits to the student author? What pitfalls, perceived or otherwise, attend the allure of each? What is the relationship of humor to earnestness, and of seriousness to irony? Is the absence of irony really the same thing as earnestness? Does the absence of earnestness somehow necessitate irony? With an eye toward technique, we will attempt to answer these and further questions by time spent among the words of those who fall along, though often refuse to stay put on, the earnest-ironic continuum. Students will be expected to write three stories or essays throughout the semester, exploring for themselves this treacherous but eminently skiable slope.

WRIT W3210,THE MODERN ARTS WRITER,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
We will examine the lineaments of critical writing. A critic blends the subjective and objective in complex ways. A critic must know the history of an artwork, its past, while placing it on the contemporary landscape and contemplating its future. A single essay will analyze, argue, describe, reflect, and interpret. And, since examining a work of art also means examining oneself, the task includes a willingness to probe one's own assumptions. The best critics are engaged in a conversation -- a dialogue, a debate -- with changing standards of taste, with their audience, with their own convictions and emotions. The best criticism is part of a larger cultural conversation. It spurs readers to ask questions rather than accept answers about art and society. We will read essays that consider six art forms: literature; film; music (classical, jazz and popular); theatre and performance; visual art; and dance. At the term's end, students will consider essays that examine cultural boundaries and divisions: the negotiations between popular and high art; the aesthetic of cruelty; the post-modern blurring of and between artist, critic and fan. The reading list will include such writers as Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, Elizabeth Hardwick (literature); James Agee, Manny Farber, Zadie Smith (film); G.B. Shaw, Willa Cather, Ralph Ellison, Lester Bangs, Ellen Willis (music); Eric Bentley, Mary McCarthy, C.L.R. James (theatre); Leo Steinberg, Frank O'Hara, Ada Louise Huxtable, Maggie Nelson (visual art); Edwin Denby, Arlene Croce, Elizabeth Kendall, Mindy Aloff (dance); Susan Sontag, Anthony Heilbut, John Jeremiah Sullivan (cultural criticism).",Margo L Jefferson,2:10pm,4:00pm,88596,Morningside,W3210-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,http://localhost:8801/professors/2096,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071615/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3210-20163-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT W3217,SCIENCE AND SENSIBILITY,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
Writing about the natural world is one of the world's oldest literary traditions and the site of some of today's most daring literary experiments.  Known loosely as ""science writing"" this tradition can be traced through texts in myriad and overlapping genres, including poetry, explorer's notebooks, essays, memoirs, art books, and science journalism.  Taken together, these divers texts reveal a rich literary tradition in which the writer's sensibility and worldview are paramount to an investigation of the known and unknown.  In this course, we will consider a wide range of texts in order to map this tradition.  We will question what it means to use science as metaphor, explore how to write about science with rigor and commitment to scientific truth, and interrogate the fiction of objectivity.",Meehan J Crist,4:10pm,6:00pm,81764,Morningside,W3217-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071616/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3217-20163-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT W3315,POETIC METER AND FORM,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
This course will investigate the uses of rhythmic order and disorder in English-language poetry, with a particular emphasis on 'formal' elements in 'free' verse. Through a close analysis of poems, we'll examine the possibilities of qualitative meter, and students will write original creative work within (and in response to) various formal traditions. Analytical texts and poetic manifestos will accompany our reading of exemplary poems. Each week, we'll study interesting examples of metrical writing, and I'll ask you to write in reponse to those examples. Our topics will include stress meter, syllable-stress meter, double and triple meter, rising and falling rhythms, promotion, demotion, inversion, elision, and foot scansion. Our study will include a greate range of pre-modern and modern writers, from Keats to W.D. Snodgrass, Shakespeare to Denise Levertov, Blake to James Dickey, Whitman to Louise Gluck etc. As writers, we'll always be thinking about how the formal choices of a poem are appropriate or inappropriate for the poem's content. We'll also read prose by poets describing their metrical craft.",Joseph N Fasano,4:10pm,6:00pm,28599,Morningside,W3315-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,http://culpa.info/professors/6553,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071612/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3315-20163-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

Corequisites: This course is open to undergraduate & graduate students. Knowledge of another language is not required. 
Chances are you know something about the Brothers Grimm, but not so much, perhaps, about the complex storytelling traditions to which the stories collected belonged.  This seminar will explore the European fairy tale in all its glorious history, including works written or collected by Charles Perrault, Jean de La Fontaine, Marie de Beaumont, Marie-Catherine d'Aulnoy (who first coined the term ""conte de fée"" or ""fairy tale""), Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, Alexander Afanasyev, Hans Christian Andersen, Oscar Wilde and George MacDonald.  Throughout the semester, we'll be talking about issues of translation in these tales and comparing them to the fairy-tale-inspired writing of our own age, including work by Angela Carter, Robert Coover, Donald Barthelme,  Kelly Link, Lyudmila Petrushevskaya, Yoko Tawada, George Saunders and others.  Analytical, translational and fantastical assignments.  No foreign language skills required.  Three papers.",Susan Bernofsky,2:10pm,4:00pm,12196,Morningside,W4010-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Bernofsky,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071619/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W4010-20163-001/,403 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT W4012,"DIVA VOICE, DIVA STYLE","Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
The figure of the diva -- the celebrated, iconic, and supremely skilled female performer -- is often characterized by her disciplined voice, singular style, and transgressive approach to the boundaries of convention.  Like the diva, the writer values voice, style, disciplined practice, and the display of virtuosity.  This seminar focuses on how American writers across a range of genres -- poetry, lyric essay, memoir, drama, biography, critical theory -- have turned to the diva as not simply the source of inspiration for their subject matter, but as a method for crafting their own signature voice or style and as a model for crossing the conventional boundaries of genre.  How has diva writing shaped and redrawn the formal contours of the lyric essay, sonnet, ode, elegy, autobiography, or theoretical discourses about race, gender, and sexuality?  What can the writing and performances by and about divas (and diva worship) teach us about our approaches to voice, style, genre, and form in our own writing practices?",Deborah Paredez,10:10am,12:00pm,71647,Morningside,W4012-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,http://culpa.info/professors/13473,gold,2.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Paredez,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071620/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W4012-20163-001/,407 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT W4312,REIMAGINING EKPHRASIS,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
At least since the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos called ""painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks,"" poetry has existed in conversation with a variety of other art forms, particularly visual art. In this class we will explore poetry as an interdisciplinary practice, with an emphasis on the work of artists who create in both the visual and textual fields. Among other key critical questions, we will consider: 1. How has an intersection with visual art been important to poetry historically? 2. How does visual experience relate to particular aspects of poetry writing? 3. How can we use visual art towards our own creative process in the future, either by using visual art in writing poetry or by incorporating illustration in the presentation of our written work? A mix of texts -- classic and contemporary poetry, illuminated manuscripts, children's picturebooks, literature that we might consider visually driven, and related scholarship form the basis for our investigations, discussions, and creative work. Among these texts we will consider work by Etel Adnan, John Ashbery, William Blake, Tisa Bryant, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Robert Duncan, Matthea Harvey, Susan Howe, Bhanu Kapil, Douglas Kearney, Ezra Jack Keats, D.H. Lawrence, Tan Lin, Fred Moten, Maggie Nelson, Frank O'Hara, Adam Pendleton, Maurice Sendak, Cecilia Vicuña, Hannah Weiner, William Carlos Williams, and W.B. Yeats, among others. Our class will function as part seminar and part workshop. We will spend much of the class discussing texts and issues surrounding the course's theme, completing in-class writing exercises, and the other parts giving each other feedback on creative work. By the completion of the course, students will have turned in six reading responses, several independent writing projects, as well as a short critical paper and a short creative manuscript.",Dorothea S Lasky,12:10pm,2:00pm,82196,Morningside,W4312-20163-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lasky,https://web.archive.org///web/20160625071613/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W4312-20163-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

This year-long course is a continuation of Elementary Yiddish II. As part of the New Media in Jewish Studies Collaborative, this class will be using new media in order to explore and research the fabulous world of Yiddish literature, language, and culture, and to engage in project-oriented activities that will result in creating lasting multi-media online presentations. In addition to expanding the command of the language that has been spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews for more than a millennium, i.e. focusing on developing speaking, reading, writing and listening skills, and on the acquisition of more advanced grammatical concepts, students will also get some video and film editing training, and tutorials on archival research. The class will continue to read works of Yiddish literature in the original and will venture outside of the classroom to explore the Yiddish world today: through exciting field trips to Yiddish theater, Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, YIVO, Yiddish Farm, and so on.
