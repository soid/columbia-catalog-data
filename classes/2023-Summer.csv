ACCT B7009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?
The course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models – models that use
financial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements – but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models – but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that
you have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.
By the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private
equity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",Radha Radhakrishna,,,12774,Morningside,B7009-20232-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7009-20232-001/,,In-Person,Business,3,,,20232ACCT7009B001,LECTURE
ACCT B8007,Financial Planning & Analysis,"This course explores the use of financial information for internal planning, analysis, and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.
Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal-reporting mistakes.
To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.
We will examine the following key topics:
Designing managerial information systems to support an organization’s strategy.
Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.
Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.
The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.
The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.
Activity-based costing and activity-based management.
Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.
Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.
The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.
The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",Igor Vaysman,6:00pm,9:15pm,12140,Morningside,B8007-20232-001,Financial Planning & Anal,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8007-20232-001/,420 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,"Business

ACCT B8009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"This course will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing financial statements. Students will learn about the general tools, theoretical concepts, and practical valuation issues of financial analysis. By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.
Course content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm’s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:
1. Understand the firm’s strategy. We will assess the firm’s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.
2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.
3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.
4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.
5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm’s current value. 
In the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",Benjamin Segal,9:00am,5:30pm,12135,Morningside,B8009-20232-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8009-20232-001/,420 Kravis Hall,In-Person,"Business

To what extent was the abolition of slavery co-constitutive to the creation and recreation of France’s first two republics? In light of a second and more “universal” abolition of slavery that France’s third republic inherited; what contradictions did the imperial nation-state carry onto the colonial conquest of Atlantic Africa? Students will explore how this particular past of slavery and its afterlife marked Black French intellectual and cultural production. This course thus bridges metropolitan and colonial histories to shed light on humanist revolutions in Europe and its limitations. Leading figures in the cultural and academic spheres of Black France will serve as guest lecturers throughout the summer term. Students will also have the opportunity to attend theatrical performances, museums, and art galleries as well as the opportunity to visit principal landmarks that attest to this larger history. ""France’s Abolitions and Republics"" is part of a consortium of Black France course offerings at Columbia University and other partnering U.S.-based universities.

  What are the historical linkages between ‘Black’ France and the United States? Between African-Americans and ‘Black’ French women and men? How is this relationship different from and contingent on the relationship between the French and their post(-)colonial ‘Others?’ Taking an internationalist (specifically transatlantic) approach and considering the 20th and 21st centuries, this course explores literature, art, culture, history, and politics emerging from or grappling with ‘Black’ France. The course features guest lectures by Black French intellectuals and cultural actors, guided museum visits and walking tours, and educational dining opportunities with owners of Black French African and Afro-Caribbean restaurants, so to offer students the opportunity to encounter ‘Black’ France in a variety of contexts, and to bring them into conversations about the fact and fantasy of ‘race’ in the complex, long-historical relationship between the United States and the French Republic.

AHIS BC2900,"The Hudson: Art, Industry and Ecology","How has the human material and imaginative relationship to the local natural world changed as we transformed that world through development and use?  How have artists from different backgrounds documented and responded to these changes?  How have they envisioned responses that healed the environmental and social wounds caused by this development?
  
In the nineteenth century, painters who depicted sites along the Hudson River helped establish New York City as the capital of America’s art world.  During the same decades painters and tourists traveled upriver on steamboats to visit New York’s sublime landscapes, industrialists were building factories, foundries and mines along the Hudson’s shores, taking advantage of those same steamboats to move their products to market.  The profound, transformative industrialization of the Hudson continued and expanded through the second half of the twentieth century, at which point a nascent environmentalist movement effected the passage of laws that began to address the environmental damage it caused. 
  
Although the Hudson River School is seen as focusing exclusively on natural subjects, the painters recorded this history and, at times, responded critically to it.  In fact, artists have played a vital role in calling attention to the Hudson’s history of industrialization and its potential for recovery throughout the past two centuries.  At the same time, the aesthetic value of the river has been essential to the passage of environmental regulations. This course traces that story by looking closely at works of art and visiting sites associated with this history.  In addition to studying works of art tracing from early landscape painting to realist depictions of the social tolls of industry from the turn of the century to the environmental critiques of land artists and others from recent decades.  In addition, we will look at objects produced by artisans and other workers which shed light on diverse groups’ experiences of the history of the Hudson, including Native Americans, African-Americans, and immigrant laborers.

Syllabus, Art in Venice
  
This course examines the art, architecture, and culture of Venice from the 14th to the 18th century. The goal of the curriculum is for students to acquire a firm visual literacy in order to read works of Venetian art and to familiarize themselves with the methods of art history. The course is set up as a field study, using the city as classroom and supporting site visits in and outside of Venice. The goal is to provide students with a solid visual knowledge and historical understanding of a set of key monuments, and to encourage them to think through the social, political, cultural, and intellectual forces at play in the creation of these works. Each day's choice of monuments is based on a walkable itinerary, visiting churches, confraternities, cloisters, palaces, and museums. Day trips include excursions to Padua and the Palladian villas in Vicenza and the Veneto.

AHIS OC4720,The Church of San Marco in Venice,"AHIS4720OC
: 
Between Byzantium and the Latin West: The Church of San Marco in Venice, ca. 829–1500. 3 Points.
  
Prerequisite: None
  
Instructor: Professor Holger A. Klein
  
This undergraduate seminar will explore the ducal chapel and state state church of San Marco in Venice in the context of the city’s medieval art and architecture. Built to house the body of the Evangelist St. Mark within the precinct of the ducal palace shortly after its translation from Alexandria in 828/29, the church of San Marco replaced an earlier ducal chapel dedicated to St. Theodore as the primary site of state ceremonies and soon developed into the most prominent shrine dedicated to the evangalist in Italy. Rebuilt and expanded several times between the first half of the ninth and the mid-eleventh centuries, the architecture of the church of San Marco was heavily indebted not only to Byzantine art and architectural traditions, but also to ceremonial traditions rooted in the Byzantine empire. Accordingly, this seminar will focus on Venetian perceptions of Byzantine art and culture from the time of the foundation of San Marco through the collapse of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1261 and beyond with a particular emphasis on the role of Venice as a cultural and artistic mediator between Byzantium and the medieval West. Emphasis will be placed on the function of Late Roman and Byzantine architectural spolia and saintly relics as markers of cultural and religious identity, the invention and visual manifestation of cult traditions, and changes in the sacred topography of San Marco as a result of Venice’s expansions on the mainland and in the Eastern Mediterranean following the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 and its struggles against rival city states, Genoa first among them.

Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course.

AHIS S3441,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MUSEUM,"This course will introduce students to the history of museums and display practices through New York collections. The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts.

Sophisticated statistical and algorithmic methodologies, generally known as data science, are now of predominant interest and focus. Yet, the underlying cloud computing platform is fundamental to the enablement of data management and analytics.
 
 This course introduces students to cloud computing concepts and practices ranging from infrastructure and administration to services and applications. The course is primarily focused on the development of practical skills in utilizing cloud services to build distributed and scalable analytics applications. Students will have hands-on exposure to VMs (Virtual Machines), databases, storage, microservices, and AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) services through Google Cloud Platform, et al.  Cost and performance characteristics of alternative approaches will also be studied. Topics include: overview of cloud computing, cloud systems, parallel processing in the cloud, distributed storage systems, virtualization, security in the cloud, and multicore operating systems. Throughout, students will study state-of-the-art solutions for cloud computing developed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.
 
 The course modules provide a blend of lecture and reading materials along with class exercises and programming assignments. While extensive programming experience is not required, students taking the course are expected to possess basic Python 3 programming skills.
 
 The desired outcome of the course is the student’s ability to put conceptual knowledge to practical use.

ARCP BC0001,Barnard Architecture + Design Summer Ins,"The Barnard Architecture + Design Summer Institute explores how design impacts the
 built environment through hands-on design projects, field trips, and opportunities to
 meet designers and makers throughout the city.
 This program introduces high school students to architecture and related fields that
 contribute to the design of our city. This three-week program includes on-campus work
 in the architecture design studio, computer lab, and the Barnard Design Center, as well
 as field trips throughout the city to see design offices, construction projects, and
 exhibitions. Students will design through drawings and models - by hand and digitally.
 Summer students will be mentored by current college students majoring in architecture
 and will have opportunities to meet design professionals and those who help imagine
 and construct the built environment.",Lindsay Harkema,2:00pm,4:30pm,00081,Barnard College,S0001-20232-001,Architecture + Design Ins,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARCP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCP/S0001-20232-001/,To be announced,,,0,,MTWRF,20232ARCP0001S001,SEMINAR
ARCP BC0013,Design Interactions,"What differentiates acts of design from other, everyday processes? Looking across our environments, we might sense the spaces we occupy are the result of hyper-controlled, coordinated procedures. From this vantage point, design seems to be everywhere, and so, how do we locate it? This course will revisit historic and contemporary design methods, artifacts, and visions to better see the ways we conceive of, represent, and mobilize design to act on the world. Design will be presented across multiple scales--from the molecular to the bodily to the planetary--as both a normalizing and potentially subversive tool. We will question its limitations and push its capacity to address existing inequities through activist and interdisciplinary approaches. Guest speakers and field trips will supplement lectures and readings. Students will apply concepts presented in class to exercises conducted in design workshops.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00094,Barnard College,S0013-20232-013,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARCP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCP/S0013-20232-013/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ARCP0013S013,SEMINAR

ARTP BC0002,Global Modernism,"The aim of this course is to explore the history and discourses of modern art, modernism, and the
 avant-garde via the social and theoretical questions understood to have driven the development
 of artistic modernism around the globe from roughly 1789 to 1968. The course will be organized
 according to four major lenses of inquiry: “Aesthetic Categories within Social Art Histories,”
 “Formalism and Autonomy,” “Perception and Artistic Production,” and “the Role of the Mind,
 or, the Beholder’s Share.” Each of these lenses, or themes, will be driven by a set of readings,
 images, and key terms that together constitute “conversations,” or orientations toward the history
 of modern art. An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into
 focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader
 discourse. However, because there is a fair amount of conceptual overlap among the course’s
 themes, the foremost goal is to enable critical analysis of modern, visual artworks from multiple
 perspectives, or within multiple frameworks. In considering the many, dynamic engagements of
 theory, history, and visual artworks, this course will provide not only a strong knowledge of
 modern art, modernism, and the avant-garde, it will also help students develop a sense of the
 methods used to study the histories and theories of modern art.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00076,Barnard College,S0002-20232-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0002-20232-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ARTP0002S001,SEMINAR

 and its history as an art form, a technology, and a mode of social and cultural communication. By
 the end of this course, students will have a rich understanding of the history of the emergence of
 photography and photographic theory. They will be able to engage with aesthetic, technological,
 and social discourses surrounding photography’s invention and development from 1839 through
 the second World War. Students will be able to relate theory with the practice of photography,
 and understand the roles photography plays in the histories of art, society, and communication.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00087,Barnard College,S0007-20232-007,History of Photography,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0007-20232-007/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ARTP0007S007,SEMINAR
ARTP BC0008,The DNA of Fiction Filmmaking,"At the heart of every movie is its story. In this immersive workshop, you will develop your visual storytelling skills to create a short screenplay – the DNA of a winning film.
  
You will learn how to grab viewers by their collective shirt collar and more importantly, hold their attention until the final credits roll. Emphasis will be placed on the classic three-act structure, plot, character development, conflict, and dialogue. Through notes and discussion of your work, we will help pick the lock on the stories only you can tell. While the world you create on the page may be fictional, you will get at the emotional truth of the characters’ lives through specifics. Perhaps paradoxical and even a bit counterintuitive, Greta Gerwig said it best, “The more particular you make something, the more universal it becomes.” 
  
Since the script illuminates the story for everyone who helps bring your vision to the screen, you’ll also discover how best to collaborate with actors, directors, cinematographers, and designers. And in short exercises, you’ll get a chance to experience the many aspects of filmmaking – including acting, storyboarding, shooting, production designing, and location scouting.
 
While sharing work will be the focus of the course, we’ll also take full advantage of New York City as both a set and source of inspiration. After all, this is a fantastic place to eavesdrop, people watch, and capture the magic for all to see.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00091,Barnard College,S0008-20232-008,The DNA of Fiction Filmma,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0008-20232-008/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ARTP0008S008,SEMINAR
ARTP BC0123,Art History of the Exploited Feminist Se,"This course will teach a history of feminist artists from the 1960s forward who have used their own trauma in their art, and explore how that has led to their personal and professional growth. Does making art out of trauma lead to exploitation of the self? Does exploitation of the self lead to empowerment? How have feminist artists navigated systems meant to oppress them, and can they operate within these systems successfully? We will explore how the trauma informed personal story can be utilized for art making, fame building, accumulation of resources and healing, and how this can be both beneficial and compromised.
  
We will visit galleries, museums and internationally recognized artists’ studios—a triple threat of experience normally not available to the public. Class will be a mix of traditional art history lecture and discussions of our visits, assigned texts, and works viewed.",Sarah Hoover,2:00pm,4:30pm,00029,Barnard College,S0123-20232-001,AHIS of the Exploited Fem,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0123-20232-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ARTP0123S001,SEMINAR

BIET PS5335,"GENDER, SEXUALITY AND BIOETHICS","The ethics of medicine, biology, and psychology deeply influence our ideas about gender and sexuality and how we establish what is “normal” about our sexed bodies. Even the most basic questions about gender identity, for example, or how we distinguish male from female (or that we distinguish at all), have been shaped by the culture of science and medicine.
  
In this class, we will examine traditional gender and sex binaries, including how they have been prescribed and enforced throughout American medical history, up to the present day. For example, people have always been born with intersex traits, and yet only in recent times have physicians intervened to manage such births. Before the 1840s, in the U.S. those born with intersex traits lived their lives the best they could, despite their physical differences, largely without medical interference. Since the 19th century, however, physicians have tried to surgically “correct” people (adults) with atypical genitals, even if that surgical management was medically unnecessary and conflicted with the person’s gender identity. Since the 1950s, providers have sought to “fix” those born with intersex conditions in infancy, before their gender identities had a chance to develop. Though physicians thought they were helping their patients live better lives, the principles we now associate with bioethics (autonomy and informed consent, for example) were too often neglected and took a backseat to physicians’ assumptions about what “better lives” might entail.",Elizabeth S Reis,4:00pm,5:50pm,10800,Morningside,K5335-20232-D01,"GENDER, SEXUALITY & BIOET",Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5335-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20232BIET5335KD01,LECTURE

BIET PS5360,CHALLENGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL BIOETHICS,"The environment affects human health and well-being, and current health-care technology can impact the environment. Thus, questions about how humans ought to relate both to their own environment and to other living beings on this planet fall squarely within the field of bioethics. While some observers may see bioethics as concerning only the health of human beings defined narrowly, bioethics in fact has many implications for the larger biosphere and vice versa. 
  
This course discusses important issues at the nexus of bioethics and the environment, including climate change, ozone shield depletion, soil erosion, ocean pollution, diminishing biodiversity-all among the environmental factors with adverse consequences for the health of both human and non-human beings. Even the technologies employed in health-
care 
have environmental impact harmful

BIGD PS0101,"Big Data, Machine Learning, and their Re","The exponential growth of data, advances in cloud computing, and machine learning have transformed every industry from retail and banking to healthcare and education. This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.
  
We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.
  
From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.
  
Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.
  
Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations.

BIGD PS0101,"Big Data, Machine Learning, and their Re","The exponential growth of data, advances in cloud computing, and machine learning have transformed every industry from retail and banking to healthcare and education. This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.
  
We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.
  
From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.
  
Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.

This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters.

BUSI B7770,International Seminar: Tel Avi,"Next to Silicon Valley, Israel is the best place for an on-site study tour of technology entrepreneurship.  Much of Israel’s technology community is concentrated in a small area populated by engineers, scientists and business people who are energetic, hospitable and happy to share their experience.
This study tour offers an intense exposure to technology and technology entrepreneurship in a unique environment that has been a fertile ground to multiple successful ventures, with many more in the pipeline.  The study tour may well be the EMBA class with the strongest impact on your career.
The week in Tel Aviv will expose you to one of the world’s most vibrant tech communities which thrives although it is geographically distant from its main markets and funding sources.  
At the end of the week you will be able to form your own views about the drivers of Israel’s tech success and its likely future curse.   You will establish familiarity with that unusual culture with which you may find yourself doing business in the future.  Moreover, you’ll take away invaluable general insights to guide you in your own career.
Competing for your attention will be Tel Aviv itself.  The town’s sidewalks are lined with crowded cafes.  It has a lively night scene with pubs, bars and clubs that keep their doors open until the early morning hours.   It stretches along the Mediterranean’s sandy beaches where the water is pleasantly warm, swimmable year round.

BUSI B8704,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundat","These days it is rare to find a business or organization that does not list Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) as a top priority. Business leaders are expected to lead diverse teams and support DEI, yet little formal education is provided to leaders in the field on the subject. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundations addresses this gap by introducing the fundamental concepts, frameworks, and theories that inform how we as leaders make meaning of diversity, equity, and inclusion personally and professionally. This course is an excellent opportunity for those interested in developing their ability to; understand and engage in conversations about diversity and inclusion; develop the ability to speak to the role DEI will play in their professional career; explore how their own identities relate to various systems of power, inclusion, and exclusion and contribute to building a more equitable workplace. Engaging with DEI is no longer a choice -- it is imperative.

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",Lien Van Geel,9:00am,12:10pm,10583,Morningside,S3058-20232-001,Worlds of Alexander the G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/S3058-20232-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232CLCV3058S001,LECTURE

CLMT G5016,An Introduction to Complex Climate Risks,"Extreme climate and weather events can lead to cascading failures that can spread within and across socio-environmental systems and sectors, often disproportionally affecting underserved communities. Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent, synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies, from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.
 
 This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world eventsin which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year long with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold-spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighbourhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.

CLMT GR5017,"Social, Equity & Governance Consideratio","In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the international community vowed to “reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,” and to achieve “rapid emissions reductions thereafter.” Despite that, however, global emissions continue to increase. The lack of progress has spurred interest in the possibility of removing greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere. Modelling by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that atmospheric greenhouse gas removal (GHGR) could help to combat climate change in three ways. First, GHGR could be used to reduce net emissions in the short-term, while countries are in the process of decarbonizing. Second, GHGR could be used to offset residual emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors (e.g., aviation) and thus achieve net-zero emissions. Third, in the longer-term, GHGR could be used to achieve net-negative emissions if deployed at levels exceeding residual emissions.
 
 Scientists have proposed a variety of GHGR techniques, but questions remain about their efficacy, benefits, and risks. Technical feasibility is not the only consideration as large-scale deployment of GHGR could raise a host of social, ethical, and governance issues. For example, some climate activists have argued GHGR may discourage action to reduce emissions, and further entrench fossil fuel use. Others have expressed concern about the equity and justice implications of deploying GHGR, arguing
 that it could exacerbate existing inequalities and place the most vulnerable at greater risk. Existing governance frameworks may not be effective in preventing these negative outcomes nor maximizing the benefits of GHGR.
 
 This course will explore possible technique for large-scale GHGR. We will discuss the feasibility of deploying different techniques, with a particular focus on the ethical, social, and governance issues that large-scale deployment could raise. We will also consider strategies for advancing just and equitable deployment and explore the role of different actors (e.g., governments, the private sector, and civil society) in ensuring that occurs.",Romany Webb,6:10pm,7:55pm,12998,Morningside,G5017-20232-001,Considerations for GHG Re,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5017-20232-001/,OTHR OTHER,In-Person,,1.5,,TR,20232CLMT5017G001,SEMINAR
CLMT GR5018,Building Equitable Community Partnership,"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional
 effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a “whole of community” approach to disaster management.
 
 The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:
  
  
Describe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience
  
Describe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle
  
Identify whole community approaches for disaster management
  
Identify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management
  
Demonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",,6:10pm,7:55pm,12999,Morningside,G5018-20232-001,Building Partnerships in,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5018-20232-001/,OTHR OTHER,In-Person,"GSAS

CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.

COMO PS0101,Geometric Topology: A Tool for Modeling,"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don’t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds — structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works — creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,10335,Morningside,K0101-20232-001,Geometric Topology: Unive,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),COMO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMO/K0101-20232-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20232COMO0101K001,LECTURE

CPLT BC3700,THE THEATER OF THE ABSURD,"The theater of the absurd was a theatrical movement that emerged in Paris in the 1950s. Plays such as Samuel Beckett’s 
Waiting for Godot
 and Eugène Ionesco’s 
The Bald Soprano
 challenged the conventions of traditional theater, staging a darkly humorous, “absurd” vision of human existence. In this course, we will conduct close readings of some of the major plays of the movement, and explore its links to the Existentialist philosophy of post-WWII France (especially the philosophy of Albert Camus). We will pay particular attention to the social and political context of the movement’s emergence; the challenge to conventions of bourgeois drama; popular and critical reception of the plays.  After brief contextualization of the period to be studied and some indications as to how to read dramatic texts, we will proceed to a close analysis of the text, performance and reception of some of the key works of the theater of the absurd, beginning with Eugène Ionesco’s 
The Bald Soprano 
and T
he Lesson
, followed by Samuel Beckett's Waiting for 
Godot
 (1953). Analysis of these plays will allow us to identify the primary characteristics and themes of absurdist drama (purposelessness and hopelessness of human existence; godlessness of the modern world; futility of action; collapse of logic; impossibility of communication etc) as well as the hallmarks of the absurdist theatrical style (its debt to mime, vaudeville, and the circus; the use of humor, ritual, and violence; theater within theater; absence of action/plot etc). With a good grasp of what constitutes absurd theater we will then familiarize ourselves with some of its literary and intellectual origins: the existentialist philosophy of J.-P. Sartre and especially Albert Camus (“The Myth of Sisyphus”); parallels to absurdism in the writings of Franz Kafka; Antonin Artaud’s ""theater of cruelty”; Alfred Jarry’s 
Ubu Roi

DEBA PS0101,Contemporary Debates in American Law and,"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the “front lines” of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.
  
A primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.
  
By the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.
  
Note:
 While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",Susan Alevas,8:00am,11:00am,10484,Morningside,N0101-20232-D01,Contemporary Debates,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DEBA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DEBA/N0101-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20232DEBA0101ND01,LECTURE

DNCE BC2001,DANCE IN PARIS,"This 28-day course is an immersion in Parisian culture from the point of view of the dancer.  The course is divided into three major components: technique, composition, and history.  Students will take a series of technique classes in modern, ballet, improvisation, world dance forms, and yoga, taught by Barnard/USF and international guest faculty, as well as opportunities to take alternative technique classes in some of Paris’s professional dance studios.  Students will be exposed to the rich artistic side of Paris through lectures and performances, as well as assigned readings by major dancers/writers/artists who have drawn on the Parisian landscape as inspiration for their work. 
  
A final choreographic project based on compositional exercises that will take students to various Parisian locales, will be presented during the final week of the course.  We will also visit many important locations essential to studying the history of dance in Western culture, including Versailles, Théâtre de la Ville and the Paris Opera.",Colleen Thomas,9:00am,9:00pm,00022,Barnard College,X2001-20232-001,,Dance @Barnard,DNCE,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DNCE/X2001-20232-001/,OTHR OTHER,,,3,,MTWRF,20232DNCE2001X001,FIELD WORK

DROM B7114,Applied Regression Analysis,"This course is designed for students who wish to increase their capability to build, use, and interpret statistical models for business.
A primary goal of the course is to enable students to build and evaluate statistical models for managerial use in finance, operations and marketing. The focus is on generating managerially useful information and practical decision-making tools, rather than on statistical theory per se. A number of actual business cases are studied.
Concepts covered are multiple linear regression models and the computer-assisted methods for building them, including stepwise regression and all subsets regression. Emphasis is placed on diagnostic and graphical methods for testing the validity and reliability of regression models.
Course topics include a review of basic statistical ideas, numerical and graphical methods for summarizing data, simple linear and nonlinear regression, multiple regression, qualitative independent and dependent variables, diagnostic methods for assessing the validity of statistical models. The course studies applications of regression to business forecasting and also examines alternative times series forecasting models, including exponential smoothing.
While the primary focus of the course is on regression models, some other statistical models will be studied as well, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and goodness-of-fit tests.
Term project: A major aspect of course is the opportunity to carry out a practical statistical analysis project of one’s own. Students work in teams on a problem of their own choosing. The goal of the project is to develop a useful statistical model for a specific business problem, with the professor providing ongoing guidance and advice during the course of project. The teams will give an oral presentation of their results at the term’s end. 
Excel is used for basic statistical analysis as well as for developing straightforward regression models. In addition, more advanced commercial statistical software, such as Minitab or SAS, is used to carry out more complex and advanced analyses.

DROM B8106,Operations Strategy,"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,"" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, ""Firm Boundaries,"" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, ""Internal Operations,"" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, ""New Challenges,"" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.""",Medini Singh,9:00am,5:00pm,12144,Morningside,B8106-20232-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8106-20232-001/,420 Kravis Hall,In-Person,"Business

DROM B8131,Sports Analytics,"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. 
Students are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the ""laboratory"" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",Mark N Broadie,9:00am,5:00pm,12134,Morningside,B8131-20232-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8131-20232-001/,420 Kravis Hall,In-Person,"Business

ECON GU4301,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOPMNT I,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213. Economic development is a complex and multifaceted process. Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 /day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",Palaash Bhargava,1:00pm,4:10pm,10047,Morningside,G4301-20232-001,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOP,Summer Session (SUMM),ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/G4301-20232-001/,227 Seeley W.

EESC S1004,Dinosaurs and the History of Life,"Dinosaurs  
explores how science works and provide practical knowledge about the history of life and how we have come to understand it. We learn how to analyze the evolutionary relationships of organisms and examine how dinosaurs came to be exemplars of a very successful group of organisms dominant on land for 140 million years. We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a “hot-house world”, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future. The non-avian dinosaur met their end in a remarkable cataclysm discovered by detective work that we will delve deeply into as a paradigm of the scientific method  Finally, they are fun and spectacular - monsters more fantastic than any person has invented in legend or religion - and they are still with us!",Paul E Olsen,1:00pm,4:10pm,10213,Morningside,S1004-20232-001,Dinos and the History of,Summer Session (SUMM),EESC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_E._Olsen,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EESC/S1004-20232-001/,506 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,MW,20232EESC1004S001,LECTURE

ENGL BC1021,FEMINIST LIFE WRITING,"Feminists have famously claimed that ""the personal is political."" Accordingly, life writing--in various genres--has been an important form for feminists across generations. In this class, we will explore the different ways in which feminists have used these modes to create visions of the self, to challenge the roles and self-images given to them, and to imagine new narratives. In particular, we'll explore questions of genre: so many of these writers have developed hybrid genres or challenged the boundaries of genre in order to write their lives. Looking at examples of life writing including letters, diaries and journals, graphic memoirs, and ""traditional"" autobiographies, we will examine these forms through the lens of gender, race, sexuality, class, and disability. Readings are subject to change, but may include: Audre Lorde,

ENGL BC3304,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, George Orwell, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,1:00pm,4:10pm,00006,Barnard College,X3304-20232-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3304-20232-001/,119 MILSTEIN CEN,,Barnard College,3,,TR,20232ENGL3304X001,WORKSHOP

Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into account the particularities of each author’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious or political contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and represented in literature? How do these authors represent the intersections of queerness with race, class, ethnicity, disability and citizenship? How have queer narratives developed over time and across cultures in conversation with local and global modes of conceptualizing gender and sexuality? How do queer authors utilize the particularities of each genre to create new forms of self-expression?
  
Texts will span various genres such as short stories, poems, memoirs, graphic novels, novels and personal essays by authors such as James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Sappho, Carmen Maria Machado, Alison Bechdel, Adrienne Rich, Casey Plett and Imogen Binnie.

ENGL S3233,SHAKESPEARE,"This course provides an introduction to Shakespeare through a combination of reading his plays and viewing them in performance. On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",Douglas S Pfeiffer,1:00pm,4:10pm,10013,Morningside,S3233-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3233-20232-001/,315 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232ENGL3233S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10014,Morningside,S3273-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3273-20232-001/,401 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3353,AMERICAN MEMORY,"Historiographically speaking this course is a study of the complex processes that evolve social memory and shape various (often deeply contested) historical narratives.  Practically speaking, this course is a study of objects (“scraps” and “fragments”) that “fix” history within the matrices of particular technologies (manuscripts, books, photographs, recorded sound and moving image) at a particular moment in time and amid a variety of historical contexts (most of which quickly become invisible to posterity).  Our challenge, really the challenge for all researchers, is to reconcile the process by which fixed history is evolved into both memory and narrative.
  
But, first, we distinguish “American Memory” from “American History.”  To begin, I suggest that history is memory codified and placed within a particular narrative (generally the final product is a published volume).  We need to consider, however, that Americans are exceptionally good at democratizing technologies of memory: Thomas Edison (recorded sound, moving image), Polaroid, and Steve Jobs (I-phone) revolutionized how (and by whom) memory is captured and shared.  I suggest, that such a collective history of memory making has created massive new opportunities to expand upon and revaluate the boundaries of “American History.” 
  
Within this critical context we will then engage the complex contestations of history that are shaping American culture today.  Does America have a national origin story?  Across American history how have the experiences of Native Americans been remembered, forgotten, and (re)remembered?  What is “The Lost Cause” and how can a narrative composed in 1865 still be tearing at the very fabric of American society?  What is “the West”?  Could the advances in Civil Rights (broadly conceived) that we associate with post World War II America have been possible without the documentation and preservation of the memories of marginalized populations from before World War II (this includes focused study of the WPA during the 1930s as well as the phenomena of “America’s documentary aesthetic.”  More recently, we will consider the connection between the processes of memorializing the Aids epidemic (the famous Aids Memorial Quilt) and the rapid acceleration of LGBTQ+ rights in America.",Ben Alexander,1:00pm,4:10pm,10253,Morningside,S3353-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3353-20232-001/,652 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3353S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3376,REVOLUTIONS IN TEXT AND TECHNOLOGY,"New media is nothing new. New media historians trace rich record of the moments when some new textual technology entered the public sphere and provoked responses ranging from widespread anxiety and to revolutionary fervor. We will examine the cultural anxieties that attend new media, stretching from Plato’s 
Phaedrus
—where Socrates warns that the advent of writing will destroy people’s memories—to today, when Nicholas Carr asks “Is Google making us stupid?” The clay tablet, the codex, the printing press, the chalkboard, the telegraph, the typewriter, the pdf, computer coding, and the smart phone have each promised to revolutionize the reading and writing publics, access to power, and even how people think.
  
This course examines those promises within their historical contexts, through critical study, and using hands-on experiences. For instance, we will study the role of clay tablets in upholding ancient empires at the same time that we craft our own clay tablet texts. We will take notes with ink pens while we study the role of Medieval scribes in spreading Christianity and Islam. We will create ‘zines while studying the Riot Grrl movement. And we will create our own html hypertexts (no prior coding experience required) as we read the earliest hypertext fiction. These hands-on experiences move arguments about the dangers and revelations of writing technologies out of the realm of the hypothetical and into the realm of the experiential.
  
The class will visit Columbia’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library (RBML) and Barnard’s Zine Archive, where we will look at textual artifacts, from ancient papyri to early print and digital texts. Our approach will prepare you to situate the contemporary textual technologies you take for granted (IMs, Twitter, Google Docs, and so on) within the long history of new media. And it will teach those pursuing literary studies, new media studies, and computer science research methods required to examine a text as a technology.",Susan Mendelsohn,1:00pm,4:10pm,10012,Morningside,S3376-20232-001,REVOLUTIONS IN TEXT AND T,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3376-20232-001/,652 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3376S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.
  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order):

You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard, The Writing Life “Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,10017,Morningside,S3915-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3915-20232-001/,652 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3915S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S4526,COMICS: READING THE MEDIUM,"This course will offer an immersion in both the history and the language of comics, from the newspaper strips through the early comic books to today's graphic novels. Beginning with readings that offer a theoretical framework and an analytical vocabulary, students will examine and discuss the way page layout, panel composition, color, lettering, sound effects, and more help carry and shape the narrative, as soundtracks and shot composition do in film. Readings will include wordless works by Shaun Tan, classic works by Alison Bechdel, as well as many that may be less familiar. Students will analyze the American, Asian, and European approaches to comics. Guest speakers from the comics industry will aid in developing students' analytical skills.

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television. Critical avenues privileged will include gender, sexuality, criminal and political economy, poetics of place, internationalism, dialect, plurilingualism and the politics of language, ethnicity and race, diaspora, philosophies of violence, philosophies of power.",Stefan Pedatella,1:00pm,4:10pm,10015,Morningside,S4930-20232-001,MADE IN AMER: MAFIA IN CI,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S4930-20232-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232ENGL4930S001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3048,British Literature to 1500,"This course will introduce some of the most fascinating texts of the first eight hundred years of English literature, from the period of Anglo-Saxon rule through the Hundred Years’ War and beyond—roughly, 700–1500 CE. We’ll hit on some texts you’ve heard of – 
Beowulf
 and selections from Chaucer’s 
Canterbury Tales
 – while leaving time for some you may not have encountered – Marie de France’s 
Lais
 and Margery of Kempe’s 
Book
. Along the way, we’ll also hone skills of reading, writing, and oral expression crucial to appreciating and discussing literature in nuanced, supple ways. 
  
If you take this course, you’ll discover how medieval literature is both a mirror and a foil to modern literature. You’ll explore the plurilingual and cross-cultural nature of medieval literary production and improve (or acquire!) your knowledge of Middle English.

ENGL UN3601,The Business Story and the Occupational,"A story in the “occupational” genre develops within a professional setting, like a hospital, airport, or police department. Occupational novels (and film and television scripts) are widely consumed but rarely studied. In this course, we will take a deep dive into the history of the genre, beginning with works from French and Soviet realisms, and continuing to American police procedurals and Japanese business novels.
  
Despite its popular image, works in this genre will lead us to profound philosophical questions about collective intelligence, personal belonging, the emergence of institutional agency, and the feeling of personal powerlessness in the face of large bureaucracies. Readings from Plato, Hobbes, Marx, Mary Douglas, Sara Ahmed other institutional theorists will therefore anchor our weekly discussion.",Dennis Tenen,1:00pm,4:10pm,10616,Morningside,W3601-20232-001,Business/Occupational Nov,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3601-20232-001/,511 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232ENGL3601W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3638,Contemporary American Short Story Collec,"In 2013, Alice Munro was honored with the Nobel Prize in literature. Munro’s award was seen as a literary landmark: the first time that the prize was awarded to a writer whose exclusive form was the short story. The award was seen as fitting recognition, not only for this writer in particular, but also more broadly as moment of recognition for the short story’s importance as a genre, especially in a publishing industry that has long been dominated by the novel.
  
In this course, we will focus on the contemporary North American short story authors featured on our syllabus: Chimamanda Adichie, George Saunders, Lydia Davis, Carmen Machado, Leanne Simpson, Anthony Veasna So. Some of the writers on this list are veterans of the short story form. Others are authors who recently published debut collections. As we work through our reading list, we will attempt to analyze not only individual short stories, but also what marks these books as collections. What might hold these texts together? What disrupts the unifying principles of a collection? And most importantly, what do short stories offer—in terms of representations of American life and culture and itscomplexity—that other forms do not?",Denise Cruz,9:00am,12:10pm,12578,Morningside,S3638-20232-001,Contemp.

ENGL UN3804,British Women Writers: the Woman Questio,"This course will examine British women writers including Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf in the context of the (long-) nineteenth-century ""Woman Question"". Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman’s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of “woman’s nature” in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman’s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between “inward impulse and outward fact”? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: “What does a woman want?”",Aileen G Forbes,9:00am,12:10pm,10617,Morningside,W3804-20232-001,British Women Writers,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3804-20232-001/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232ENGL3804W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3808,The Novel and Economic Justice,"Global capitalism inspired novelists to explore the ways in which money, or the lack of it, forms or deforms our characters.    It also inspired the writings of Karl Marx, the great theorist of economic justice.  In this seminar we will read three early novels – Behn’s 
Orinooko
, Godwin’s  
Caleb Williams
, Austen’s 
Persuasion
 alongside Marxist theory, and then examine a cluster of twentieth century global novels in English.   We will pay special attention to Marxist notions of materialism; alienation and human flourishing; capital and labor; classes; and ideology.  Special emphasis will also be given to the Marxist approach in the study of culture, the role of intellectuals (such as ourselves) and the relationship between capitalism and culture – through theorists like Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, and Raymond Williams.     
  
The course tracks how key Marxist concepts such as capital and class consciousness, reification, commodification, totality, and alienation have been developed across these traditions and considers how these concepts have been used to rethink literary and mass cultural forms and their ongoing transformation in a changing world system. Writers discussed may include Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Georg Lukács, Mikhail Bakhtin, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Amílcar Cabral, Edward Said, Antonio Gramsci, Raymond Williams, Giovanni Arrighi, Pascale Casanova, David Harvey, and Melinda Cooper.",Ross T Hamilton,1:00pm,4:10pm,10642,Morningside,W3808-20232-001,The Novel and Economic Ju,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3808-20232-001/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3808W001,SEMINAR
ENGL W3595,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL: GENRE AND,"In the late seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel.  It told the stories – not of the princes and princesses – but of ordinary people on extraordinary voyages, from villages to the Metropolis, from England to Africa and the Americas. In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century – country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.
  
Why does the novel appear?  What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society?  Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?  To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.  Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen. Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,
 Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.  Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",Ross T Hamilton,5:30pm,8:40pm,10019,Morningside,S3595-20232-001,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NO,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3595-20232-001/,652 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20232ENGL3595S001,SEMINAR
ENGP BC0002,Flash Forms,"The most compelling creative nonfiction usually balances two things on a scale: looking inward and looking outward. The writer usually commands the attention of the reader with personal fixation, urgent inquisition, and/or evocative occurrence before allowing the self to move beyond and observe, digest, and/or criticize the world with a keen eye. To learn how to do so, we will be reading diverse works of nonfiction that center an honest, complex, and incredibly porous narrative, each combining the reflective and the analytical in its distinct style. We will also approach major genres of nonfiction, including memoir and personal essay, and other miscellaneous forms such as diary and writing with archival materials. There will be voluntary in-class and take-home exercises that encourage students to practice techniques exemplified by assigned texts, while weekly writing assignments will give students opportunities to adopt these skills to fit their own language and style.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00072,Barnard College,S0002-20232-002,An Intro to Reading/Writi,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/S0002-20232-002/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ENGP0002S002,SEMINAR

Who are the parents? What happened to the baby? Where are the parents selling the shoes? Who will buy them? A work of flash fiction or nonfiction gives us just enough information to suggest narrative and character, while leaving us to fill in the gaps with our imagination. In this workshop, we'll practice writing very short essays, stories, and prose poems, assessing what makes them evocative and memorable. We'll read very short works by Jamaica Kincaid, John Edgar Wideman, Lydia Davis, George Saunders, and others, with attention to how these writers create meaning through very few words, while gesturing towards context off the page. We'll practice writing flash with prompts given in class.

ENGP BC0012,Uses of Violence,"In this course, we’ll explore the use of violence in short stories and fiction. We’ll look
 at how violence, be it emotional, political, or physical, can serve to develop conflict
 and character in fiction. How does fictional violence serve to disrupt and unsettle
 not only the narrative, but the reader as well? To explore this, we’ll move from the
 philosophical exploration of violence in works by Dostoyevsky and Moravia to the
 more raucous display in Cormac McCarthy’s Westerns and Highsmith and
 Thompson’s noirs, from the repressed, lurking violence in short stories by writers
 Such as Carver and Gaitskill to the textual violence found in postmodern writers like
 Acker. Along the way, we’ll meet assassins, prisoners, skinheads, schoolgirls, and
 gangsters. How and why do these characters excite or repel us? How far can we
 push the characters in our own fiction, and how far should we? How can violence
 illuminate the larger political or societal forces that exist in specific moments of
 history? How does violence in fiction create an often unexpected, yet deeply
 significant, catharsis and consequence?",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00093,Barnard College,S0012-20232-012,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/S0012-20232-012/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ENGP0012S012,SEMINAR

Students will perform weekly exercises to practice and explore traditional forms, discuss predecessors of American performance poetry, and offer critical exegesis on each other’s work. The second half of the class will be spent in performance. We will study current spoken word performances, voice training techniques, and intersections between acting and poetic theories.

ENGP BC0123,The Arguments in Your Head: Playwriting,"In The Arguments in Your Head: Playwriting Workshop, we’ll explore and develop the foundational skills, techniques, and instincts that you’ll need to write a full-length play. The goal of this class is not to write a perfect play (doesn’t exist!) Rather, the goal is to let go of what you think you should be writing to impress others and instead learn to become the stewards of your own urgent questions and aesthetics principles. This workshop will be process-focused rather than outcome-focused. As your teacher, my concern is not perfection— I care about pulse. Everyone will be bringing in new, unfinished work that is a little raw and uncomfortable. No one knows what they’re doing, we’re all in the same boat! My goal for you is not to get stuck when you get lost (because if I do my job right you will get lost), but instead I hope to give you tools that help you find your way in the dark, take bold risks, and above all keep going. Every play is different and has its own rules. In order to fashion those rules autonomously we have to learn to listen deeply, follow an inarticulate hunch, and above all, be willing to fail. Be brave, playwright! This is where the wildness lives, where all the scary fun is to be had. And in the end… it’s just words on a page, ink on paper— you can always tear it up and start over. By the end of this class, you will have written a draft of a full-length play, learned how to give thoughtful feedback on the plays of your classmates, and developed a more critical eye to the plays that you read.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00090,Barnard College,S0123-20232-011,THE ARGUMENTS IN YOUR HEA,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/S0123-20232-011/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232ENGP0123S011,SEMINAR

While Black Harlem forms the focal point of our investigation, the wide varieties of identities that found a home in uptown Manhattan, from the Native American, Dutch, and British periods, to the early American era, to the rise of German, Italian, Jewish, and Latinx Harlem, to the ""New Renaissance"" currently underway uptown, are also covered. Of particular interest is the role of women in Harlem, as farmers and traders in the Native American, Colonial, and early American periods, to writers, musicians, and sculptors during the Harlem Renaissance, to the current generation of uptown politicians, artists, and educators.

EPID P8484,INTRO TO ADV EPI METHODS,"This is a 1.5 credit course designed for students who have successfully completed the Columbia Summer Research Institute (CSRI) program which provides an introduction to the conceptual foundation and application of advaned epidemiologic analysis methods. The course will take place over five 4-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will cover multiple analysis topics and will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods including descriptions of their relationship to causal inference and a discussion with examples of the types of study designs and data the methods can be used with. Following the lecture will be a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises to give them hands on experience implementing the anlytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis ans present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset).",,9:00am,12:30pm,11098,Health Science,P8484-20232-D01,,Epidemiology,EPID,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EPID/P8484-20232-D01/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,R,20232EPID8484PD01,LECTURE

ETHI PS0201,Introduction to Philosophical Enquiry: E,"Most broadly, ethics is concerned with how it is best for us, as human individuals and communities, to live – how we understand and relate to ourselves, each other, and beyond. What goals or values should we pursue? What kinds of lives are good and worthy of choice (for anyone)? What moral duties do we have – are there individual actions or social policies which are (morally) required or forbidden? And to whom or what do we owe them – in virtue of what do entities have moral standing? Is acting morally good for us and, if so, would this compromise the ethical worth of so acting? What is the source of our knowledge, if any, about these matters, and how do we resolve conflicting answers to these questions? 
  
While attending some to ‘meta-ethics’, the course focuses on normative ethics and its application. After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics – consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly ‘Kantianism’ and ‘contractualism’), and some of the traditions of ‘virtue ethics’. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech. 
  
Our authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois. 
  
The course has three main goals for students: 
1
) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives – historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western – on ethics; 
2
) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct (logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; 
3
) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly. 
  
There are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",,8:00am,11:00am,10505,Morningside,N0201-20232-D01,Philosophy: Ethics,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ETHI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ETHI/N0201-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20232ETHI0201ND01,LECTURE

FILM BC1020,NEW YORK CITY IN FILM,"This course will explore the representation of New York City in film. We will examine the way that film portrays social problems and either creates or responds to “social panics.” We will also examine the way in which film actively creates an idea of “New York” through cinematography, directing, acting and other aspects of filmmaking.  Some topics to be considered are utopia/dystopia, race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, art, immigration, houselessness, and gentrification. The course follows three main themes: 1. How the filmmaking process (camera movements, lighting, dialogue, acting, etc.) is used as a method to describe space (filmmaking as a geographic method). 2. How various genres of film have been used to portray the social geography of New York City (the geography of film). 3. The relationship between the viewer’s “place” and the places portrayed in the film (communication geography).

FILM BC3702,MAJOR WOMEN FILMMAKERS,"Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood’s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as “marginal” or “peripheral” cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet… are these motion pictures really “secondary”? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called “alternative women’s cinema” at the core of film history. Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women’s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agnès Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, Věra Chytilová, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertmüller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...).

This course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. 
  
In the early 1960s, a number of new film movements emerged in national cinemas around the world. Called “new waves” or “new cinemas,” these movements, made up of young filmmakers, would challenge the cinematic industrial structures in each of their respective nations, as well propose both radically different approaches to filmmaking and to cinematic storytelling. Perhaps inevitably, these films and filmmakers would also be drawn into larger political discussions about the futures of their respective nations. This course will explore three important examples of this development—the French New Wave, the Japanese New Wave and the Brazilian Cinema Novo—detailing both the commonalities among these movements (aesthetic, social, technological, political) as well those factors which made each unique. Among the filmmakers included will be Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Nagisa Oshima, and Glauber Rocha. The relationship of these respective “new waves” to simultaneous radical experiments in visual arts, theater, literature and music will be a special focus of the course. A watershed moment in film history that would forever change the way films were made, financed, seen and discussed.

FILM S2295,WORLD CINEMA: MEXICO,"The global success of film directors Alejandro González Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón, and Guillermo del Toro has attracted much attention to the New Mexican Cinema. Yet this «Nuevo cine mexicano» cannot be understood without knowing the traditions of Mexico’s intricate film history. This course explores the numerous tendencies of Mexican cinema through the analysis of its most representative genres, features, and directors since the so called Golden Age (1938-1957). An in-depth analysis of films such as Emilio Fernández’s 
La perla
 (1947), Luis Buñuel’s 
Los olvidados 
(1950), Jomi García Ascot’s and María Luisa Elío's 
En el balcón vacío
 (1962), Alejandro Jodorowsky’s 
La montaña sagrada
 (1973), and Arturo Ripstein's 
Profundo carmesí
 (1996) will contribute to define the characteristics of the most relevant «national» genres – from 1940s melodramas to 1970s psychedelic movies and 1990s crime films. The study of the New Mexican Cinema of Iñárritu (
Amores perros
, 2000), Cuarón (
Y tu mamá también
, 2001), and del Toro (
El laberinto del fauno
, 2006) will comprise an examination of the complex relationship between the US and Mexican film industries, as well as a critique of the very notion of «national identity» in today’s globalized world. We will also analyze new tendencies in commercial, experimental, and documentary Mexican films – including Carlos Reygadas'

We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities.

What are the historical linkages between ‘Black’ France and the United States? Between African-Americans and ‘Black’ French women and men? How is this relationship different from and contingent on the relationship between the French and their post(-)colonial ‘Others?’ Taking an internationalist (specifically transatlantic) approach and considering the 20th and 21st centuries, this course explores literature, art, culture, history, and politics emerging from or grappling with ‘Black’ France. The course features guest lectures by Black French intellectuals and cultural actors, guided museum visits and walking tours, and educational dining opportunities with owners of Black French African and Afro-Caribbean restaurants, so to offer students the opportunity to encounter ‘Black’ France in a variety of contexts, and to bring them into conversations about the fact and fantasy of ‘race’ in the complex, long-historical relationship between the United States and the French Republic. ""'Blackness' in French is part of a wider 'Black France Consortium cohort that will engage over the course of the five-week session in a broad range of co-curricular activities and programming.

Prerequisite: 4-5 semesters of French language study or the equivalent. 
  
French cinema is characterized by its artistic richness, its vigor and, above all, its diversity. This film history course will function as a journey in which we explore contemporary French cinema. Our itinerary will take us from the 1990s, those of “young French cinema” and neoclassicism, to the end of the 2010s, those of directors like Julie Delpy and Christophe Honoré. Together, we will develop a panorama in which the works of Cédric Klapisch and Nicole Garcia will intersect, as well as those of Céline Sciamma and Arnaud Desplechin.
  
The objective of this course will be to introduce students to French cinema, its history and its diversity. We will also have the chance to correlate academic knowledge and practical experience, so as to give the students a significant idea of French film activity. The application process is competitive and will take place onsite in February.

GERM S1115,ACCELERATED ELEM READING I/II,"Prerequisites: no previous knowledge of German required, but some background is strongly recommended. This accelerated survey of German grammar, reading techniques, and dictionary skills is designed primarily for graduate students preparing for reading proficiency exams or wishing to do research in German-language literature. In addition to translation, the course focuses on strategies for extracting general and specific information from German texts (skimming and scanning) and judging their relevance for a specific research purpose. Reading texts take students' fields of study into consideration. Although this course does not satisfy any part of the foreign language requirement for degree candidates, successful completion of the translation on the final exam fulfills the German reading proficiency requirement in most graduate programs. Students are advised that this course is a full-time commitment. Students should expect to study 2 hours every day for every hour spent in the classroom and additional time on weekends.

The Practicum's participants will be registered for the course ""Public Hellenism,"" which will meet daily from 10:00-11:00 (with the exception of a few days when it will meet 10:00-12:00). This course consists of three parts.The first part (weeks 1 and 2) introduces students to public humanities and Greek history and culture, is structured around an examination of 
SNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece
, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).
  
The second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.
  
Throughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).
  
Course Objectives
: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia.

HCM_ PS5380,HCM: Labor Relations for a Changing Worl,"In this elective course, students will examine the theory and practice of labor relations as context for exploring new and emerging unionization trends. It is intended to provide students with competencies to understand why workers seek union representation, understand the legal and regulatory framework surrounding labor relations, and develop critical thinking skills to address changing expectations around DEIA, business ethics, and generational pressures. Grounded in a review of the labor movement’s historical underpinnings in the U.S. and globally (ex. China, Japan, Korea, EU, Great Britain), the course will provide a comprehensive examination of labor relations topics ranging from union organizing, collective bargaining and contract administration, to incipient issues such as unionization in new industries and work groups, the impact of shareholder and customer pressures, and potential contradictions between a company’s stated ethical principles and its day-to-day labor relations decisions.
  
The course is designed for current or aspiring HCM and other professionals seeking to develop their capabilities to provide strategic labor relations guidance within their organizations. The objective is to impart a sophisticated understanding of why workers unionize, examine effective management responses to unionization, and master the legal and ethical framework in which these activities take place. Students will acquire skills to address existing and emerging labor relations issues facing organizations, competencies in foundational legal and compliance issues, and the ability to address strategic and practical challenges that impact the labor-management relationship.

Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10003,Morningside,S3116-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S3116-20232-001/,613 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,4,,MW,20232HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the 
Global Core
 requirement, which is reflected on the Columbia online registry.  The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits. Finally, the course is regularly

The course will explore the idea of revolutionary ethics as conceived by Western and non-Western political philosophers and militants. The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties. Students will be exposed to different discourses of political militancy and radical politics and to reflect on the ethical implications of the history of radical thought and action in comparative perspective.",Alheli Alvarado-Diaz,1:00pm,5:00pm,10008,Morningside,S4981-20232-001,REVOL/RAD POLITICS-MARX-M,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S4981-20232-001/,509 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,4,,TR,20232HIST4981S001,SEMINAR
HIST UN2176,"REVOLUTION & EMPIRE: HAITI & FRANCE, 178","Few periods in history have stirred imaginations and been debated as much as the so-called “Age of Revolution” at the turn of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Long seen through a self-righteous North-Atlantic lens, this era of (democratic) revolutions has today been decentered both spatially and conceptually to encompass other revolutionary upheavals around the globe and their twin other: empire. This course takes stock of these developments to explore how revolution and empire developed in tandem in France and Haiti, with ramifications across the Caribbean, Europe and beyond from 1789 to 1820. Topics covered include: the end of an “old” regime and birth of several new ones; the largest and most successful slave revolt in history; revolutionary politics and social transformation; the terror; Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture, and charismatic leadership; the first “total war” and new forms of empire-building; the legacies, memory, and forgetting of these events. Throughout, the course considers revolutionary upheaval and imperialism as intertwined processes driven both by determinate logics and by unintended consequences.
  
This course is lecture-based although students are expected to engage in short document-based discussions in class. All classes and readings will be English, and no prior knowledge of the period is required.",Thomas Dodman,9:00am,12:10pm,10007,Morningside,W2176-20232-001,REVOL & EMPIRE: HAITI & F,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2176-20232-001/,311 Fayerweather,In-Person,,3,,TR,20232HIST2176W001,LECTURE
HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

HRTS GU4050,"Young People, Human Rights, Gun Violence","This 3-credit course aims to give students a foundation in research, policy, and practice relevant to gun violence and the human rights of young people. In the first part of the course, we look at the US. In the US gun violence against children has increased, as part of a broader nationwide rise in crime. School shootings have also risen: The Washington Post counted 42 last year in the U.S., the most on record and up from 27 in 2019.  In addition to exploring its underlying causes, the prevalence, and solutions to gun violence in homes, schools, and communities in the United States, young peoples’ participation in legislation and other efforts to address physical insecurity. In the second half of the course, students examine the ways in which US foreign policy– including in the areas of small arms waivers, direct gun sales, and migration, have shaped the lives of young people in other nations. The focus of this part of the course will be on Central America where armed violence has had a dramatic impact on young people and has resulted in forced displacement and loss of education for young people. Throughout the course, students will explore the gun-related human rights issues affecting young people through the study of cases, reports, documentaries, and other visual images including satellites and aerial images. Students will examine the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 2250 and 2419-- the Youth Peace and Security Agenda (YPS), the Arms Trade Treaty, and the Optional Protocol on the Child Soldier, as well as the U.S. Youth Peace and Security Act of 2021 (HR 4838), national legislation that prioritizes the inclusion of youth in conflict resolution and recognizes that youth participation is a key component of U.S. peace and security strategy. An ongoing and significant consideration in the course will be the role of international education efforts and youth-led advocacy and legislative efforts around gun control legislation. 
  
In addition to the topics mentioned above, students will acquire and deepen their understandings
  
  
the framing of gun violence and violence caused by small weapons as human rights issues for young people, including but not limited to the international and national human rights laws that protect the right to life, development, survival, and protection
  
the impacts that race, ethnicity, gender, age, life experience all have on the realization of young people’s human rights

IEOR E4734,FOR EXCH/RELATD DERIVATVS INST,"Foreign exchange market and its related derivative instruments—the latter being forward contracts, futures, options, and exotic options. What is unusual about foreign exchange is that although it can rightfully claim to be the largest of all financial markets, it remains an area where very few have any meaningful experience. Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives—given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most of that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least comparatively speaking, a fact that makes the foreign exchange market an ideal platform for derivatives. The emphasis is on familiarizing the student with the nature of the foreign exchange market and those factors that make it special among financial markets, enabling the student to gain a deeper understanding of the related market for derivatives on foreign exchange.",David Derosa,6:00pm,8:30pm,12558,Morningside,E4734-20232-001,FOREIGN EXCH/RELTD DERIVATIVES,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IEOR/E4734-20232-001/,627 Seeley W.

IKNS PS5301,Strategic Consulting for Knowledge-based,"The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with the typical phases of an internal or external consulting project. The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,  phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A  typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor/client  relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a  variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or  product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and  the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and  proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.  
  
 
  
  Successful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the  client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on  the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to  work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual  and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing  expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability  to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.  During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,  processes, and social factors that promote successful change.  
  
 
  
  This course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external  organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives. No  prerequisites.",Edward J Hoffman,8:10pm,10:00pm,11033,Morningside,K5301-20232-D01,STRATGIC CONSLTNG FOR KNW,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5301-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20232IKNS5301KD01,LECTURE
IKNS PS5305,The Science of Communities and Networks,"For-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike, are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, foster pluralism, and innovate. For example, realtor COMPASS, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and electric cooperatives are all leveraging networks. The ideas of “open” and “collective” are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.
  
 
  
“The Science of Communities and Networks” presents the structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:
  
 
  
  
social networks
  
communities of practice (or knowledge-networks),
  
open source,
  
open data, and
  
open innovation.

: This 1 semester course (elective, IKNS students only, hybrid) provides an opportunity for a student to extend or supplement their educational experience via a deep-dive into an established or novel area of research of their choice (the topic), under the guidance & supervision of a faculty member (the supervisor). An independent study course allows a student to work one-on-one with a faculty member to gain & contribute new insight into the discipline of Knowledge Management.
  
Topic/objective
: The topic is chosen by the student as long as it falls within the general realm of Knowledge Management or its specific content areas in the IKNS curriculum, such as IT systems, knowledge organizing systems, data repositories, business data analytics including machine learning & AI, learning processes, collaboration, dialogue, team & project management, transformational leadership, change management, digital transformation, or digital product innovation. The course will therefore serve the dual purpose of allowing a student to pursue their own intellectual curiosity & to make a contribution to the wider discipline of Knowledge Management. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the content they acquired in other courses, by applying this content to the specific topic chosen for the Independent Study.
  
Logistics
: Ahead of registration, the student meets with the supervisor to discuss & agree on (i) the topic & the relevant IKNS curriculum area(s); (ii) the timeline of deliverables, milestones, & contact hours for the semester; & (iii) the number of credits. The student summarizes these points in a ~1 pg

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10054,Morningside,S6559-20232-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INAF,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INAF/S6559-20232-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,In-Person,,3,,TR,20232INAF6559S001,SEMINAR

From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication.

It provides historical perspectives on the development of today's Ukraine, analyzes the evolution of its politics since independence, and delves into its quest for Euro-Atlantic integration. While providing an assessment of political, social, and economic transformations, the course examines major causes of Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity. The current political situation in the country and the current war with Russia will be thoroughly investigated. The top priority of Ukraine's foreign policy is to ensure international support for its efforts to rebuff Russia’s full-fledged aggression and to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Can diplomacy still play a role? What is to be done to solve existing internal problems? What is to be done to restore the country? Can Ukraine’s president, its government, and parliament solve all these problems? Is there a future for UN peacekeeping operations in Ukraine? These and other issues, including international assistance to Ukraine, behind-the-scenes activities, power struggles, and diplomatic endeavors are analyzed in the course.

This class will explore the city of Venice as it appears on screen and in real life. We'll sit in the cool of an air-conditioned classroom as we watch films from such directors as Woody Allen, Andrea Segre, Luchino Visconti and Silvio Soldini. Then we’ll explore the city ourselves to experience first-hand the settings for so many films. Among the many questions we’ll explore: Whose Venice are we seeing, that of the tourists or of the inhabitants? Why are so many love stories set in Venice? What about the “Venice” in Las Vegas? In California?
  
Requirements: active participation in all class discussions; midterm; and final in-class exam.

This course is intended primarily for beginning students who have no prior knowledge of Classical Japanese (bungo 文語 / kobun 古文 / kogo 古語, etc.). It is designed to give students a systematic and intensive introduction to the grammar of classical Japanese. Texts are taken mainly from the Heian and medieval periods, though texts from later periods will also be introduced. It is expected that by the end of the course students will have acquired a firm foundation in classical Japanese grammar and will be able to read classical Japanese texts with the aid of a dictionary. Students will generally find that they also have an improved grasp of modern Japanese grammar and will also gain experience in using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries. The course will also include some instruction in reading cursive Japanese, primarily variant kana (hentaigana).

KNOW PS0101,"Knowledge, Reality, and Truth","Is it possible that how things “really” or “truly” are is very different from how they appear to us? Could it be, for example, that the “real world” in which we believe ourselves to live is actually a computer program, á la 
The Matrix
? If not, then how can we know that this is not the case – what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge – what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference – would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways – if we actually are living in the Matrix?
  
In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato’s 
Republic
 and René Descartes’ 
Meditations
, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.
  
This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students’ abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.
  
Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10381,Morningside,N0101-20232-001,"Knowledge, Reality, and T",Pre-College Programs (SHSP),KNOW,,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/KNOW/N0101-20232-001/,329 Uris Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20232KNOW0101N001,LECTURE

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative.

Instructor:
 Madeleine Dobie
  
Taught in English. 
  
This course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. 
  
This course examines the social, political and cultural history of migration in the Mediterranean,
 with a particular focus on France and Africa. We examine the forces that have underpinned
 migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions
 in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an
 object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political,
 social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres
 and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with
 questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between
 politics and the arts.

MGLO PS0101,The Media and Politics in Global Perspec,"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.
  
We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.
  
Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10395,Morningside,N0101-20232-001,Media and Politics: Globa,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MGLO,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MGLO/N0101-20232-001/,607 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20232MGLO0101N001,LECTURE
MIGR PS0101,Global Migration & Personal Identity,"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one’s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.
  
This course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?
  
Participants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies—and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.
  
We approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.
  
Outside of class, students read articles on migration theory as well as various case studies, including life stories of young migrants in Europe, accounts of the border crisis in the US, and testimonies from DACA recipients.

NANO PS0226,Introduction to Material Science & Nanot,"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials—the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today’s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures—bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures—light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.
  
In this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.
  
Students investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia’s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",Luis A Avila,3:10pm,5:00pm,10398,Morningside,N0226-20232-001,Material Science & Nanote,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NANO,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NANO/N0226-20232-001/,711 Havemeyer Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20232NANO0226N001,LECTURE

NECR PS5050,INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH CARE NEGOTIATION,"The topic of health care continues to capture the attention of the nation in ongoing debates fueled by rising costs, overutilization and the implementation of much needed reforms (Affordable Care Act). As the healthcare industry continues to rapidly evolve, it provides immense opportunities for learning and applying concepts, theories and research related to negotiation and conflict resolution in procurement of medical devices and difficult conversations such as advanced directives to name a few. This course is applicable not only to students pursuing careers in health care, but is also designed for students who are interested in applying negotiation skills that they have learned in an environment that can be emotionally charged and conceptually complex. 
  
Throughout this course students will be given the opportunity to apply the skills they have learned from previous classes as well as solidify key concepts including but not limited to negotiation preparation, quantitative/qualitative analysis, influence, social cognition, asymmetrical information, and conflict resolution in a healthcare context. This course is designed to challenge each student to harness their critical thinking skills, uncover nuances and recognize the complexities associated with multiparty negotiations in healthcare. This course aims to enable students to develop and implement strategic processes that help bring parties together and promote new perspectives that will bridge the gap between the classroom and real-life scenarios. 
  
During the course, students will gain insight into the history of the US healthcare system as well as the changing dynamics associated with the Health Care Reform, and end of life discussions. This course will emphasize the role of negotiations from multiple perspectives and will utilize an expert panel videos of such subject matter experts as hospital administrators/executives, physicians and medical device manufacturers in order to provide historical case studies as well as review real-life negotiations. Students will actively engage in negotiation planning and role plays, read case studies and other materials about negotiation and the healthcare field, as well as, use industry software to help them prepare for negotiations.",Rodney K Jr. Erb,,,11004,Morningside,K5050-20232-D01,INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH CA,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5050-20232-D01/,,On-Line Only,"Business

NECR PS5107,Organizational Conflict and Mediation,"This required NECR course will introduce the concepts and skills of mediation, a type of third-party conflict intervention. This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict.

NECR PS5250,THE ART AND CRAFT OF PRACTICE,"The elective “The Art and Craft of Practice
”
 
course is designed to introduce students to key practical insights, tips, and professional skills necessary for any successful conflict resolution practitioner. In this course, students will be required to practically apply some of the tools and techniques of NECR, and appreciate the importance of combining and reformulating the basic NECR concepts in order to serve their exact needs in the field. 
  
Through this course, students have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the classroom, learn additional practical research skills, and adjust them to their own very specific professional aspirations in the field. This course also helps students strategize their next professional steps in the field in a concise, methodical way. 
  
It is important to keep in mind that the Conflict Resolution field at large is quite diverse, and our students have unique backgrounds and future aspirations. Therefore, this course is customized in coordination with each student during 1-on-1 sessions that take place at the beginning of the semester, in order for each student to be working on something that is clear, and has practical value for his/her very specific professional interests. 
  
As with many things in life, proactiveness, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit are keys to success for our very challenging field.  Each student will be having a required 1-on-1 session with the instructor, where the instructor will help the student explore ways to creatively strategize their next professional steps as practitioners and also develop the instructions for the final paper that match the needs of the student. 
  
Overall, the goal is to provide students with an enriching, personal experience that helps them rethink their role as practitioners and strategize better their short/ long term goals in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution.",Nikolas Katsimpras,9:00am,1:30pm,11032,Morningside,K5250-20232-H01,THE ART AND CRAFT OF PRAC,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5250-20232-H01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,1,,U,20232NECR5250KH01,LECTURE

NECR PS5880,"Interpersonal Dynamics: Collaboration, F","The Skills Practicum: Self as Instrument course develops students’ capacity to act as reflective practitioners of constructive conflict resolution. Building on theories presented in Introduction to Negotiation and Introduction to Mediation, the course provides students with many opportunities to develop self-awareness and to practice the skills of negotiation, mediation, and facilitation.
  
To intervene as skilled practitioners, conflict-resolution professionals need to understand both what they themselves bring to the table as well as the appropriate strategies and communicative skills for effective conflict management. Along with those skills, they require a deep understanding of how their own worldview shapes their biases and perspectives to form the lens that they use to view and respond to conflict.
  
Students bring their own unique experiences, insights and communicative strengths to the learning process. This course seeks to build on these contributions, providing (1) tools for deepening self-awareness as a means of advancing connection to others, (2) opportunities for strengthening their face-to-face communication skills as negotiators and as mediators, and (3) techniques for developing their skills as third-party facilitators.",Robert Anderson,9:00am,5:00pm,11012,Morningside,K5880-20232-001,SKILLS PRACTICUM,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5880-20232-001/,328 Uris Hall,In-Person,"Business

NOPM PS5160,COMMUNICATIONS & MARKETING FOR NONPROFIT,"This introductory core course examines the central role of marketing and communications in fulfilling the mission of nonprofit institutions of all types and at all stages of development. The programmatic objective of this course is to build a shared set of competencies and understandings around the power, practices, ethical applications, and desired outcomes of nonprofit marketing and communications.
  
Dramatic changes across civil society in recent years, including the evolving role of nonprofits in democratic discourse and the rise of new forms of communications technologies, means that nonprofit leaders today must have a fundamental understanding of the principles of marketing and communications in order to ensure organizational success both internally and externally. While outreach technologies and trends change rapidly in our era, true excellence in the field is based upon a core group of basic skills that are hardly novel: strong writing and analysis, strategic planning, and the ability to connect disparate individuals across a wide range of disciplines and diverse backgrounds to build an inclusive community around shared goals.
  
This course is designed to help students gain these skills through engaging with the strategic frameworks and tactical applications needed to create and leverage a range of communications and marketing activities. The course will introduce students to multiple communications and marketing practices designed to engage key stakeholders, including donors, the media, volunteers and advocates, and additional internal and external influencers and sector leaders. Throughout the semester, the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all forms of outreach (written and oral; digital and print) will be foregrounded.

NSCI PS0100,Neuroscience and the Law,"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.
  
The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.
  
Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?
  
Some of the topics that may be addressed include the 
Frye and Daubert
 standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.
  
The course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",Florina Altshiler,3:10pm,5:00pm,10404,Morningside,K0100-20232-001,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NSCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSCI/K0100-20232-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20232NSCI0100K001,LECTURE

PHIL S3601,METAPHYSICS,"This course will survey topics in contemporary metaphysics. We will focus on material objects, time, modality, causation, properties, and natural kinds. We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds.

First the conceptual issues are analyzed through contemporary essays on these topics by authors like Peters, Hart, Williams, Berlin, Rawls and Schumpeter. Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau.

PHMN PS0100,"Minds, Brains, and the Nature of Conscio","How is the mind related to the brain? Are sensations, beliefs, and desires immaterial or physical states? What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?
 
 We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.
 
 Course readings include such influential works as René Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's ""Sensations and Brain Processes,” Hilary Putnam’s “The Nature of Mental States,” and Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.
 
 The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students’ analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",Jared Peterson,1:10pm,3:00pm,10410,Morningside,K0100-20232-001,Intro to Philosophy of Mi,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHMN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHMN/K0100-20232-001/,318 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20232PHMN0100K001,LECTURE

Themes include power and decision-making, the leadership and administration of cities, present day problems and strategies to deal with them, the historical origins of urban politics, past federal and state policies toward cities and the contemporary consequences of these patterns. The survivability of the city in the face of contemporary overlapping crises will be addressed. Among other topics, students can expect to focus on urban political economy, political machines and urban reform, immigration, race and ethnicity in urban politics, regional efforts to contend with economic development and crisis, federal laws and policies that have shaped today’s urban environment, the day to day administration of cities, and urban problems such as fiscal strain, poverty, the burden of growth and attracting economic investment, the costs and consequences of urban terror, disaster, extreme political lability, and the evolving global city.",Judith Russell,1:00pm,4:10pm,10571,Morningside,S3232-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3232-20232-001/,509 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,4,,MW,20232POLS3232S001,LECTURE

Modern theories attempt to characterize the human mind in terms of information processing. But machines that process information do not seem to 
feel 
anything; a computer may for instance receive inputs from a video camera, yet it would be hard to imagine that it 
sees 
or experiences the vividness of colors like we do. This course explores behaviors by understanding the influences of biological processes. What does a prototypical neuron look like? How do neurons talk to each other? How does neuronal communication produce behavior? Then we will move into asking deeper questions like: what happens in the brain when you want to move? why do we dream? How do we form memories? Nobody has yet provided a convincing theory as to how to explain the subjective nature of our mental lives in objective physical terms. Over four weeks, 
CSP23
 attempts to provide a strong introductory foundation to the field of human neuroscience.
  
Each week we will review a neuroscientific field, by following the four main components of the scientific method:
  
  
Observation and formulation of scientific questions
  
Data collection and analysis
  
Accurate and transparent communication of results
  
High-level discussion of the findings and future directions and societal relevance

PUBH P6032,RESEARCH METHODS & APPLICATIONS,"Successful public health studies, policies, and interventions rely on evidence to guide their design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Because public health is not a simple, reactive, “take the pill three times a day” solution, but a purposeful approach to preventing disease and promoting health, the tools of scientific inquiry to document, measure, evaluate, and understand all the consequences of health interventions are essential. Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed. The methods introduced in this course will provide a toolkit with which to help measure and estimate the relationships between the smaller pieces that comprise the complex and dynamic web of systems in public health.",Michelle K Smith,,,14210,Presbyterian Hospital,P6032-20232-D01,RESEARCH METHODS & APPLIC,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6032-20232-D01/,,On-Line Only,Public Health,4.5,,,20232PUBH6032PD01,LECTURE
QMSS GR5066,Entrepreneurial Principles and Quantitat,"This course is structured around class-wide and individual exercises that introduce students to the key principles of entrepreneurial thinking, such as identifying problems and opportunities, thinking creatively, developing minimally viable products (MVPs) and low fidelity prototypes, creating a reliable workflow, pivoting and course-correcting, finding valuable help, and developing productive habits. In addition, students are introduced to the key tools of quantitative reasoning, including surveys, observational data, experiments, simulation and projections, data analysis, statistical reasoning, organized researching, and persuasive and authoritative writing – and how those tools support entrepreneurial projects. Students should leave the class equipped with the sense that they themselves can produce constructive change in their world, along with a blueprint for how to go about getting it started.",Gregory M Eirich,9:00am,12:10pm,10258,Morningside,G5066-20232-001,Entrepren & Quant Reasoni,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5066-20232-001/,327 Seeley W.

QMSS GR5067,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING SOCIAL SCIENCES,"Social scientists need to engage with natural language processing (NLP) approaches that are found in computer science, engineering, AI, tech and in industry. This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",Patrick Houlihan,5:30pm,8:40pm,10259,Morningside,G5067-20232-001,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING S,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5067-20232-001/,313 Fayerweather,In-Person,,3,,MT,20232QMSS5067G001,SEMINAR

QMSS S5019,DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON,"This course is meant to provide an introduction to regression and applied statistics for the social sciences, with a strong emphasis on utilizing the Python software language to perform the key tasks in the data analysis workflow. Topics to be covered include various data structures, basic descriptive statistics, regression models, multiple regression analysis, interactions, polynomials, Gauss-Markov assumptions and asymptotics, heteroskedasticity and diagnostics, data visualization, models for binary outcomes, models for ordered data, first difference analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Through a variety of lab assignments, students will be able to generate and interpret quantitative data in helpful and provocative ways. Only relatively basic mathematics skills are assumed, but some more advanced math will be introduced as needed. A previous introductory statistics course that includes linear regression is helpful, but not required.",Gregory M Eirich,9:00am,12:10pm,10257,Morningside,S5019-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/S5019-20232-001/,330 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232QMSS5019S001,SEMINAR
QMSS S5072,MODERN DATA STRUCTURES,"This course is intended to provide a detailed tour on how to access, clean, “munge” and organize data, both big and small. (It should also give students a flavor of what would be expected of them in a typical data science interview.) Each week will have simple, moderate and complex examples in class, with code to follow. Students will then practice additional exercises at home. The end point of each project would be to get the data organized and cleaned enough so that it is in a data-frame, ready for subsequent analysis and graphing. Therefore, no analysis or visualization (beyond just basic tables and plots to make sure everything was correctly organized) will be taught; and this will free up substantial time for the “nitty-gritty” of all of this data wrangling.",Michael Parrott,1:00pm,4:10pm,12483,Morningside,S5072-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/S5072-20232-001/,337 Seeley W.

QMSS S5073,MACHINE LEARNING SOC SCI,"Prerequisites: basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra, and calculus This course will provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning as it is applied in a number of domains. Comparisons and contrasts will be drawn between this machine learning approach and more traditional regression-based approaches used in the social sciences. Emphasis will also be placed on opportunities to synthesize these two approaches. The course will start with an introduction to Python, the scikit-learn package and GitHub. After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python. Previous programming experience will be helpful but not requisite.

RELI BC4001,Curating Islam in NYC,"This course focuses on the ways in which museums conceptualize, contextualize, curate and display Islamic art.  In the process, it interrogates the degree to which the orientalist past and the secular present shapes our understanding of the Muslim world.  Students will not just engage with material objects from Muslim societies but also consider the choices museums make about their display and presentation.  These choices, in turn, speak to the role of museums in defining a specific understanding of the “sacred.” Finally, students will learn to thoughtfully and critically pose questions about the roles that museums as public institutions play in sharping public and private understandings of Islam.
  
The course begins with a general discussion of material objects in the study of religion.  This is followed by a broad survey of Islamic Art which both describes and critiques the category as it has been framed in the Academy.  Students then visit a number of museums to learn about the style and content of their Islamic collections.  The course concludes by engaging a different kind of curation, namely oral histories in the Brooklyn Museum.",Najam I Haider,9:00am,12:10pm,00026,Barnard College,X4001-20232-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),RELI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X4001-20232-001/,113 MILSTEIN CEN,,,4,,MW,20232RELI4001X001,SEMINAR

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings.

SNET PS0100,The Networked Self: Identity in the Digi,"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.
  
Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the “commodified self” and “self-branding.” 2) “Digital surveillance” and the “managed self.” 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically “marginalized” identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.
  
The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10427,Morningside,K0100-20232-001,The Networked Self,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SNET,,http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SNET/K0100-20232-001/,607 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20232SNET0100K001,LECTURE

SOCW T7601,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment that was originally developed for chronically suicidal individuals and is now the gold standard treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder.  The treatment and its adaptations have since been proven through research to be effective across a wide range of disorders and behavioral problems which have at their core the issue of Pervasive Emotion Dysregulation.   Students will be introduced to key theoretical concepts that inform the “spirit” of DBT, along with an overview of core treatment strategies as used within a DBT skills group. This course is focused on DBT skills, and will provide students with a basic understanding of the four DBT skills modules (Core Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance). The focus will be on the revised and expanded DBT Skills Manual released in late 2014.  Through course assignments and in-class activities, students will have an opportunity to learn the content of the skills, as well as how to structure and conduct a DBT skills group.   Students will develop a beginning understanding of standard comprehensive DBT, the particular function of each treatment component, (e.g., individual, group, consultation team, coaching) and how DBT skills relate to the other program components. The basic format of this course will include the Instructor's presentation of concepts and principles, group discussion, modeling, role-plays, and technique coaching.  As a practice elective, the major focus is on skill development.  As such, students are expected participate fully in in-class practice exercises and be receptive to feedback from their classmates.",Grace G Berman,9:00am,11:30am,12337,Morningside,T7601-20232-001,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILL,Social Work,SOCW,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCW/T7601-20232-001/,304 School of Social Work,In-Person,,3,,W,20232SOCW7601T001,SEMINAR

It is designed to prepare students for intensive DBT training and for their DBT internships in the community and for ensuring that program interns are prepared for beginning DBT practice with client populations exhibiting a range of behavioral dysfunctions. These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class. Personal development as a clinician and personal practices that improve performance are an integral part of all these activities.",Siddhi Patel,1:00pm,3:30pm,12338,Morningside,T7602-20232-001,DBT PRACTICE,Social Work,SOCW,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCW/T7602-20232-001/,404 School of Social Work,In-Person,,3,,T,20232SOCW7602T001,SEMINAR

Heavy emphasis will be placed on learning behavioral assessment techniques and developing treatment strategies based on behavioral conceptualizations. Specific techniques for putting this knowledge into practice will include instruction in functional analysis, behavioral assessment, behavioral change strategies, case conceptualization and treatment planning. Students will also gain knowledge of recent “third wave” behavioral treatments. Evidence and outcomes for behavioral treatments will be reviewed.

SOSC P8910,INTRODUCTION TO RACE AND HEALTH,"It is widely acknowledged that as a variable, 'race' often explains a significant portion of the variation we observe in patterns of morbidity and mortality. But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct ‘race’ to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",,,,11103,Morningside,P8910-20232-D01,INTRODUCTION TO RACE & HE,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P8910-20232-D01/,,In-Person,,1,,,20232SOSC8910PD01,LECTURE
SPAN BC3305,Sustainable Communities in Ecuador: What,"Indigenous people in Ecuador, which represent about 7% of the Ecuadorian population (United Nations, 2015), are disproportionately poor compared with the rest of the population. In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution. Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis. 
  
The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.  It aims to:
  
1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.
  
2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.
  
3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.
  
4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.
  
5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",Maria E Lozano,9:00am,9:00pm,00025,Barnard College,X3305-20232-001,SUSTAINABLE COMMUN.

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.  Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked “experts only.”  The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.  Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",Lucius J Riccio,6:10pm,8:00pm,11058,Morningside,K5033-20232-001,DECISION MODELS & MGMT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5033-20232-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,MW,20232SUMA5033K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.
  
Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.
  
This course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,11059,Morningside,K5035-20232-001,GHG EMISSIONS CARBON FOOT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5035-20232-001/,703 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,TR,20232SUMA5035K001,LECTURE

Limits to growth, rapidly fluctuating raw material prices, and the emergence of new technology options all contribute to heightened risk and opportunity in the energy sector. The purpose of this course is to establish a core energy skill set for energy students and prepare them for more advanced energy courses by providing a basic language and toolset for understanding energy issues.
  
Using theoretical and practical understanding of the process by which energy technologies are developed, financed, and deployed, this course seeks to highlight the root drivers for change in the energy industry, the technologies that are emerging, and the factors that will determine success in their commercialization. Understanding these market dynamics also informs good policy design and implementation to meet a broad range of social welfare goals.

As you leave the school and become leaders of organizations financial literacy will be a skill set that will be vital to success no matter what career path you go down. It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.
  
To understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm. The course also provides a practical introduction to selected non-financial accounting topics including sustainability reporting standards, ESG corporate performance indicators and corporate social responsibility report (CSR Reporting).",Brad Schwartz,6:10pm,8:00pm,10807,Morningside,K5195-20232-D01,"ACCTG, FIN & MODL OF SUST",Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5195-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,MW,20232SUMA5195KD01,LECTURE

SUMA PS5470,CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR SUSTAINABILITY PROF,"Throughout history, societies have discovered resources, designed and developed them into textiles,
  
tools and structures, and bartered and exchanged these goods based on their respective values.
  
Economies emerged, driven by each society’s needs and limited by the resources and technology
  
available to them. Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the
  
overextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast
  
technological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of
  
the disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a “take-make’-
  
waste” manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our
  
planet’s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological
  
advancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;
  
which begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?
  
The premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative
  
economic future are available to us. By looking at resources’ potential, we can shape alternative methods
  
of procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,
  
products and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into
  
both the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and
  
restoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications
  
required in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially
  
transformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic
  
structures, systems and processes.
  
This is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability
  
leaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us
  
(as rapidly as we need) into a more sustaining future. The class will be comprised of a series of lectures,
  
supported by readings and case-studies on business models, design thinking and materi",Diana A Trushell,6:10pm,8:00pm,11093,Morningside,K5470-20232-001,CIRC ECON FOR SUST PROFS,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5470-20232-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,W,20232SUMA5470K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5770,Sustainable Management of Forests,"The course intends to give an overview of forests – how they function, and how they can be managed sustainably. The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.  The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.  For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival. The course is going to emphasize the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contribution of deforestation to climate change.",Ralph C Schmidt,6:10pm,8:00pm,10812,Morningside,K5770-20232-001,SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGE,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5770-20232-001/,303 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,T,20232SUMA5770K001,LECTURE

We see how technology has obfuscated the demarcation and delineation lines between entertainment media. Rather than perceiving this as a problem or challenge, this course approaches such an evolution from the point-of-view of infinite possibilities.

It introduces executive students to the multifaceted realities that supervisors of project managers deal with in the context of technology systems. It pays especially close attention to crisis management in the context of programs, and provides students with best practices for addressing corollary concerns. The course will introduce students to multiple frameworks for managing programs – offering students perspectives from global project managers.
  
Some assignments in this class mimic the kinds of deliverables a program manager will be expected to produce throughout the course of managing a suite of projects. Students must therefore develop an approach to program management based on actual projects within their company or industry.

TMGT PS5270,EXECUTIVE PRESENCE NOW,"This elective course that will enable Technology Management Master’s students to develop the confidence and skills
 in communication, self-reflection, emotional intelligence, and decision-making that are at the core of executive
 presence. More specifically, honing executive presence in today’s work environments requires leaders to actively
 engage with issues of difference, inclusion, and diversity and develop a working knowledge of power dynamics,
 personal and organizational identities, and articulation of one’s vision and values. This course situates executive
 presence alongside diversity equity and inclusion issues that arise in the technology management workplace. Core
 topics in Executive Presence Today include: 1) establishing trust and credibility as an executive; 2) interpreting and
 disrupting racism, exclusion, and bias; 3) communicating authentically; 4) driving internal and external change; and
 5) making sound decisions in ambiguous, complex, high-stakes contexts.
 Throughout the course, you will study executive presence through the lens of technology professionals, learning
 from case studies and executives in the field from varied technology industries in corporate, mission-driven or non-
 profit, and education contexts. You will explore how to lead with poise and confidence in a technology management
 context where constant digital innovation and disruption are the norm. You will examine issues of cyber security
 decision-making where establishing credibility among senior officials may present conflicts to your values,
 identities, and closely held relationships. You will articulate a vision for how technology can be leveraged to
 innovate and improve products, services, and company bottom lines while deepening your communication skills.
 In this course, you will be learning about yourself as a leader and hone the skills of executive presence
 through work in the field with mentor executives and peers, in-class collaborative learning experiences, regular
 reflective writing, weekly public speaking assignments with immediate feedback, and written assignments.",Sarah Benis Scheier-Dolberg,6:10pm,8:00pm,11146,Morningside,K5270-20232-001,,Technology Management,TMGT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/TMGT/K5270-20232-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,M,20232TMGT5270K001,SEMINAR

These principles will be explored in the context of our contemporary geopolitics and political economy to examine why difference is often - to the contrary - characterized by inequality. Furthermore, scholarship in sociobiology and sustainable development will raise our consciousness about how the destruction of the material world is intimately tied to increasing stratification in the social world. Finally, we will turn our attention to the culture wars: great disagreements, misunderstandings, and contests of expressive values that include inauthentic and well-intentioned ignorance and inconsistency regarding these social movements. In this context we will also consider the political economy of knowing and being to define our own praxes for living in and making a more enduring and just social world.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00070,Barnard College,S0001-20232-001,Sustainability Diversity,Pre-College Program (Barnard),URBP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBP/S0001-20232-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232URBP0001S001,SEMINAR

URBS S3311,"RACE, SPACE AND URBAN SCHOOLS","Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools.  And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who look very much like ourselves.  In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly racially diverse.  In this class, we will use public schools in New York as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions.
 
 We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the relationships between city schools and their local contexts?  What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”?  How are spaces inside of schools racialized?  We will use ethnographies, narrative nonfiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives.  You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.

WKLM PS0101,Introduction to Labor Studies,"This course serves as an introduction to the multidisciplinary study of organized labor and collective bargaining, with a primary focus on the United States. Recent years have seen an upswing in labor activism, including organizing campaigns and strikes at major American employers like Amazon, Kellogg’s, and John Deere, as well as by schoolteachers and other workers in the public sector. Students who are curious to explore such issues will find in this course valuable tools for understanding these and other related developments, and for situating them in the larger context of American labor history, the current framework of U.S. labor relations, and global movements for workers’ rights.  Each day of class will feature both a lecture session and a small group activity designed to introduce practical aspects of labor studies, such as how social scientists use data to analyze the economic effects of unions or how labor and management bargaining teams approach the task of negotiating a contract. The course is designed for high school students who may never have taken a class in economics or related disciplines but who are eager to learn more about what labor unions are, how they work, what they do, and what their larger impact is on society and the economy.",Matthew M Mazewski,1:00pm,3:00pm,10553,Morningside,K0101-20232-D01,Introduction to Labor Stu,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),WKLM,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WKLM/K0101-20232-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20232WKLM0101KD01,LECTURE

WOMP BC0002,Women & Comedy,"“Women and Comedy” focuses on the intersection between comedy and gender, race, class and sexuality. Aware that as Judith Butler says, “the process of securing greater freedom for women requires an ongoing rethinking of this category,” we use the term “woman” not as a fixed position but an entry point into discussing history – specifically to interrogate and challenge comedy’s all-too-long and enduring history of making a punchline out of marginalized groups. We will explore laughter as a subversive act and how the identity of a “funny woman” can be both dangerous and liberating. As Margo Jefferson writes, “Given the history of social restriction and sexual regulation, how many women have been in a position to -- or been willing to -- take these risks?” We will explore how the tools of comedy can be used to make mischief, to transgress the bounds of genre and form and to contest popular ideas about difference and power. How can humor be illuminating? How can humor be feminist? How can humor be intersectional? How can humor help us tell the hard truths? Can we laugh at oppression without laughing it off? This course does exclusively focus on humorists and welcomes writers of all genres who want to get playful. Rather than “funny,” we focus on “fun,” explore playfulness as it occurs in myriad ways across a diverse variety of texts. As we do, we will find models, key writerly moves, to adapt into our own writing whatever shape or form it takes. As we shift to sharing our own thoughts and work, we will do so from a place of generosity. As Charna Halpern, Del Close and Kim “Howard” Johnson put it: “A truly funny scene is not the result of someone trying to steal laughs at the expense of his partner, but of generosity – of trying to make the other person (and his ideas) look as good as possible.” Let’s share and discuss from this place of generosity. Rather than prescriptive critiques, let’s ask one another “what’s the fun of this story?” Let’s urge each other to see how can that fun remain, adhere, and grow through our time together.",Nina Sharma,2:00pm,4:30pm,00069,Barnard College,S0002-20232-002,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WOMP/S0002-20232-002/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232WOMP0002S002,SEMINAR
WOMP BC0003,"Race, Ethnicity, and US Society","What is “race”? What is “ethnicity”? How are they related and how do they shape the life chances of people in the United States? In this class, we discuss racism’s origin story, particularly how capitalist interests motivated the creation of racial hierarchy. We focus on how White-controlled institutions and elite actors mediate racial and ethnic groups’ access to material and social resources, leading to Whites disproportionately benefiting from U.S. social processes. We investigate social processes through intersectional—noting relationships between race, class, and gender—and historical lens, highlighting how racism evolves over time in response to resistance. We also examine the consequences of racism across social domains. Our course concludes by grappling with the questions: (1) How effective have social movements, and other forms of social organization, been in resisting and ending racism? (2) What are the implications for current racial justice activism?",Angela Simms,2:00pm,4:30pm,00071,Barnard College,S0003-20232-003,"Race, Ethnicity, & US Soc",Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WOMP/S0003-20232-003/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232WOMP0003S003,SEMINAR
WOMP BC0009,The Politics of Remembrance: Black Women,"This course is a general overview of the methods and approaches to the histories written on slavery and resistance. In it, we will consider the expansive reach of the Transatlantic slave trade to the Americas, its relationship to modern-day capitalism, and the contemporary debates on reparations. Students will learn to interpret and read various sources that contemplate the political and socioeconomic realities of slave societies. We will mainly examine the experiences of enslaved African-descended people through Black feminist approaches and methods. Therefore, the course will mainly focus on the location of women in these societies and the construction of gendered and racialized identities within these frameworks. In effect, this course explores how Black people, particularly Black women, have organized resistance strategies during slavery and through the re-narration of slave histories in academic and public spaces.
  
In the second half of the course, students will consider the relationship between studies on slavery and the collective public memory of slavery in Europe, coastal Africa, the Caribbean, and North and South America. To better understand activism and the construction of memory, students will visit various “memory spaces” in New York City, including the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the African Burial Ground, and the Flatbush Burial Ground. As this course demonstrates, the history of slavery is often written and narrated outside of official institutions and academic spaces. From this perspective, we will also engage with alternative methods (i.e., the body/corporeal forms) to narrate the slave past in theater, public protest, and “rest as activism” through outlets like the “Unheard Voices” theater workshop and yoga/ meditative practices. Overall, the course will unpack issues of gender and race by studying slavery and its narration throughout the transatlantic world and how the descendants of enslaved people have “rewrote” these histories in their intellectual work, art, and political activism",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00092,Barnard College,S0009-20232-009,The Politics of Remembran,Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WOMP/S0009-20232-009/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232WOMP0009S009,SEMINAR
WOMP BC0101,"Sex, Power, God","This course will also consider shifting notions of sex, power, and god that represent the increasingly complex relationship between identity, knowledge, and media in the modern era as we explore the concurrent changes in the social, political, and economic systems that made it possible for millions to worship the massive media culture icons of the 20th century: the Disney princess, First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and Princess Diana. By exploring these changes in the works of scholars like Tim Wu and Bernard Harcourt we will gain a deeper sense of contemporary sexual politics in “expository society” as we determine the criteria for evaluating the success of the modern celebrity. Finally, we will consider how the celebrity reality tv industrial-complex shifts notions of sex, power, and god by exploring the emergence of icons “famous for being famous” in the 21st century whose command of attention and social influence in the digital age represents power, capital, and divine myth befitting a queen: Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian West.",,2:00pm,4:30pm,00037,Barnard College,S0101-20232-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WOMP/S0101-20232-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20232WOMP0101S001,SEMINAR

Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing.

WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"The Young Adult (YA) publishing boom has changed the way we read—and write—coming-of-age stories. This course will introduce students to the elements that shape YA novels, and explore the fiction writing techniques needed for long projects, including narrative arcs, character construction, worldbuilding, and scene work. We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",Emily K Austin,1:00pm,4:10pm,10158,Morningside,S4323-20232-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4323-20232-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20232WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,5:30pm,8:40pm,10159,Morningside,S4810-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20232-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:00pm,4:10pm,10154,Morningside,W3215-20232-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20232-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20232WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
WRJN PS0100,Creative Writing: Journalism and Nonfict,"What creative possibilities do true stories hold? How can truth telling and storytelling work together? How can we turn ourselves—and other real people—into compelling characters? This class considers the possibilities of journalism and creative nonfiction. We will explore sub-genres ranging from news and magazine writing to memoir and personal essay; from science writing and profiles to humor, food writing, and lyric essay. Students will learn research and reporting skills essential to all forms of nonfiction writing, as well as how to incorporate techniques traditionally associated with fiction writing into journalism and nonfiction.
