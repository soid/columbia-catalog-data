The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.\n Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm\u2019s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.\n The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization\u2019s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors\u2019 internal-reporting mistakes.\n To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.\n \n We will examine the following key topics:\n ? Designing managerial information systems to support an organization\u2019s strategy.\n ? Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.\n ? Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.\n ? The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.\n ? The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.\n ? Activity-based costing and activity-based management.\n ? Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.\n ? Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.\n ?

    "course_descr":"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?\nThe course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models \u2013 models that use\nfinancial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements \u2013 but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models \u2013 but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that\nyou have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private\nequity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",

The framework consists of the following steps:\n1. Understand the firm\u2019s strategy. We will assess the firm\u2019s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.\n2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.\n3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.\n4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.\n5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm\u2019s current value. \nIn the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",

Each day's choice of monuments is based on a walkable itinerary, visiting churches, confraternities, cloisters, palaces, and museums.

It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context.

    "course_descr":"This course will focus on the reception and influence of medieval European architecture in New York City through the buildings and monuments that revive, replicate, and preserve it. We will examine the architectural as well as the social, historical, and political environment of nineteenth and twentieth century New York City, in which medieval architecture came to symbolize not only religion but also erudition, exoticism, heritage, education, civic pride, and even hygiene. Alongside Gothic Revival churches, skyscrapers, campuses, and parks, this course will consider other forms of medieval architectural revivalism (including Moorish Revival synagogues and Romanesque Revival rowhouses) as well as projects that physically relocated medieval buildings to New York City both for private collections and public display. We will combine regular field trips to sites around the city with readings and discussions and will make use of the archives of several prominent revivalist architects in Avery Library\u2019s collections.",

The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.\u00a0 With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",

    "course_descr":"The use of artificial intelligence\u2014propelled by deep learning techniques\u2014to analyze, curate, and generate digital images is having a profound influence on visual culture, one that well exceeds Jacques Derrida's anticipations of the effects of technology on society as he described them in Archive Fever. While regulation around emerging technologies such as AI is being formulated across the globe with much urgency, a problematic concept of \u201ctech ethics\u201d is being espoused by the leading technology companies that imposes a simplistic moralistic framework on potential policies. Through examination of the creative applications of AI, the aim of this seminar is to foster a nuanced critical discourse on AI art that places the ethics of emerging technologies at center stage. This course provides students with an introduction to the history of AI art and explores the challenges and opportunities that this burgeoning field faces, especially in regard to the regulation of technology. Class visits to Mercer Labs, Artechouse, MoMA, and the Whitney will allow students to directly engage with the core concepts of the seminar.\n  \nThe course begins with reflection on Adorno\u2019s prescient statement that technical rationality is \u201cthe rationality of domination,\u201d and challenges both the cynicism and optimism around emerging technologies and their effect on visual culture. We will question the accountability that art history and other fields of study have, if any, to steer the ethics debates spurred by today\u2019s \u201cculture industry\u201d of digital images, and ask what the custodianship of this space entails by examining its structures of power, conveyed visually or through automated processes enabled by computer vision science. By interrogating the socio-cultural effects of the use of machine learning on images\u2014such as algorithmic biases that lend to discrimination, or surveillance and privacy concerns in regard to facial recognition technologies\u2014new and diverse perspectives on visual culture are investigated. Although the mechanisms that enable technology to develop may be lending to the commodification and homogenization of visual culture, the seemingly democratic promises that big tech touts keep us captivated yet surprisingly uncritical. If the transformative role of AI on our visual culture is constituting a new type of archaeology of knowledge, how do we critically lend to its discourse through the theories, methods, and experiments surrounding art and AI?",

It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts. Reading primary sources from the period under examination is a crucial part of the course.",

The course is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the idea of \u201canthropology of Islam\u201d through different readings in anthropology and various, experiences, practices, dimensions of Islam as a relationship between humans and God. In the second part, the focus is to listen to Islam and connect the different sonic bodies of Islam to power and politics. The third part interrogates preconceived ideas about Islam, gender, feminism, and agency. The fourth part studies Islam, body, sexuality and eroticism. The fifth part is concerned with Islam, youth culture, identity, belonging and rebellion. The last part critically analyzes Islam, modernity, orientalism, post-colonialism and not least today\u2019s fear and notion of imagined enemies.",

We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial\/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality. We will pay particular attention to the concept of the 'Muslim woman' in both the colonial and colonized imagination.",

Since it has been eight years since I last taught this course here at Columbia (which I taught, under various different titles, six times between the years1999 and 2016), it needs to be extensively updated to include the numerous Millennial\/Apocalyptic\n  \nmanifestations that have arisen globally during this more recent period of time, the most current one perhaps being the re-election of our once and future president, Donald J.

Being able to effectively present data analytics in a compelling narrative to a particular audience will differentiate you from others in your field. This course takes students through the lifecycle of an analytical project from a communication perspective. Students develop written, verbal, and visual deliverables for three major audiences: data experts (e.g., head of analytics); consumer and presentation experts (e.g., chief marketing officer); and executive leadership (e.g., chief executive officer).\n  \nStudents get ample practice in strategic interactions in relevant social and professional contexts (e.g., business meetings, team projects, and one-on-one interactions); active listening; strategic storytelling; and creating persuasive professional spoken and written messages, reports, and presentations. Throughout the course, students create and receive feedback on data storytelling while sharpening their ability to communicate complex analytics to technical and nontechnical audiences with clarity, precision, and influence.",

The course will be organized\n according to four major lenses of inquiry: \u201cAesthetic Categories within Social Art Histories,\u201d\n \u201cFormalism and Autonomy,\u201d \u201cPerception and Artistic Production,\u201d and \u201cthe Role of the Mind,\n or, the Beholder\u2019s Share.\u201d Each of these lenses, or themes, will be driven by a set of readings,\n images, and key terms that together constitute \u201cconversations,\u201d or orientations toward the history\n of modern art. An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into\n focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader\n discourse. However, because there is a fair amount of conceptual overlap among the course\u2019s\n themes, the foremost goal is to enable critical analysis of modern, visual artworks from multiple\n perspectives, or within multiple frameworks. In considering the many, dynamic engagements of\n theory, history, and visual artworks, this course will provide not only a strong knowledge of\n modern art, modernism, and the avant-garde, it will also help students develop a sense of the\n methods used to study the histories and theories of modern art.",

For example, it is generally thought that health matters. But then what is health? And how does it matter? What is justice in respect to health-care and the other social determinants of health? Do competing theories of justice (e.g., liberal, libertarian, utilitarian) offer incompatible solutions to the question of healthcare justice? Or can a workable \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d at the public policy level nevertheless be achieved?\n  \nShould a healthcare professional be permitted, on grounds of conscience, to refuse to provide a healthcare service to which people are lawfully permitted? Indeed, what should count as \u201cconscience\u201d? In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, some have argued for a right to conscientiously insist on providing reproductive services that have been legally prohibited. How are we to sort through and resolve this complicated set of issues?\n  \nCould a meaningful personal understanding of what it means for someone to have died nevertheless not be suitable as the basis for a legal declaration of death? Why not? Should there be a \u201cconscience clause\u201d option whereby someone can specify in advance the conception of death to be applied in that individual\u2019s own case? Would every possible criterion be available or would certain criteria have to be excluded? Which? Why?\n  \nThe population in this and many other societies is aging and putting increasingly significant demands on the healthcare delivery system. Should healthcare be rationed according to age?\u00a0 Would it be unfair to young people not to give weight to that factor\u2014lest they lose out on a fair chance to live as long as society\u2019s seniors already have? What is healthcare justice across the generations?\n  \nAs researchers gain a fuller understanding of the aging process, it may soon be possible to genetically engineer a significant extension (even doubling?) of human life-span. Is this an appropriate objective for healthcare science to be pursuing?\u00a0 Is the point of healthcare to extend human life as far as possible by whatever means? Is aging a kind of \u201cdisease\u201d in its own right? Would life so dramatically extended be beneficial or burdensome?\n  \nThe topics for this course have been selected in view of (i) how fundamental they are to bioethical thinking (e.g., What is health?",

After learning how these tools provide superior analytic results than traditional regression techniques in making inferences about the real world, students will gain the practical knowledge to wield them successfully and make better decisions with data.",

This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters. Please note absence from the first day of class will result in automatic forfeiture of students' registration. Auditing is not permitted (no exceptions).",

The course covers emissions sources and their impact on climate change, followed by an exploration of the policy landscape, including current legislation, carbon markets, and climate justice. The course then evaluates current and evolving mitigation technologies, reviews the tools of climate finance, and considers strategies for reducing emissions to net zero. Finally, the course introduces the role of businesses in addressing climate change, including net-zero goals, actions they can take to mitigate their impact, and the perspectives of shareholders. \nThroughout the course, the business case for climate action is emphasized, highlighting the economic benefits of taking action to address climate change.",

Students in the course will learn about a topic in ancient Greek and Roman thought \u2014 stories about autonomous tools \u2014 and how that topic relates to social history and culture in the ancient world.

Mediterranean Humanities I is not a requirement to enroll in this course.\u00a0Instructor: Konstantina Zanou\n  \nWhat is the Mediterranean and how was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization? A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and political difference, the Mediterranean has been seen as the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing border and a unifying confluence zone, as a sea of pleasure and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. By exploring major works of theory, literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, South\/North and East\/West divides, tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism, borders and divided societies) and to \u2018read\u2019 the sea through different viewpoints. In the final analysis, Med Hum II is meant to arouse the question of what it means to stand on watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly shifting lens. The Summer version of the course is adapted to contain more material on Venice and its Mediterranean surroundings.\n  \nThis course fulfills the Global Core requirement and the requirements of Columbia's Italian major and Mediterranean Studies minor. For Global Core, please note students may only receive Global Core credit for either \nCLIA4500GU\n or CLIA4600OC; not both.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n\u00a0\nColumbia in Venice\n\u00a0\nprogram through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships\n\u00a0available.\u00a0\nTuition\n\u00a0charges apply.\u00a0\nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Sessions Terms.

    "course_title":"Building Equitable Community Partnership",
    "course_descr":"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional\n effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a \u201cwhole of community\u201d approach to disaster management.\n \n The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:\n  \n  \nDescribe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience\n  \nDescribe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle\n  \nIdentify whole community approaches for disaster management\n  \nIdentify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management\n  \nDemonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",

The field itself is now highly multi-disciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, anthropology, political science, computer science, engineering, earth sciences, psychology, and medicine and public health. These academic fields have intersected with the practice community by informing holistic emergency planning for all members of a community. Furthermore, these research outputs have informed federal and state policy, the private sector, and community organizations to inform program design and implementation. Translating research into practice remains a constant challenge in this rapidly evolving field. The methodological approaches to disaster research are just as diverse and have become increasingly complex with the advent of big data, the ubiquity of spatial information, and novel cross-disciplinary research. As a new era of compound and cascading disasters has triggered a constant \u201cresponse\u201d mode within the field of emergency management, the need for practitioners and research with a fluency in research and evaluation methods is required to critically evaluate or generate high quality and ethically based research.",

    "course_title":"Climate Ethics, Leadership and Managemen",
    "course_descr":"Often, our progress toward the remediation of persistently accumulating human damage to our collective home, the biosphere, is attributed to large-scale entities having a rather amorphous quality. Such are the industrial revolution, the global north, capitalism, colonialism, and countless preoccupied, habituated or denialist components of the human population. Yet, the dynamics of all types of leadership and management, whether in public, civic or private organizations, frequently push back on the progress desired, in more specific ways. These dynamics are so characteristic that climate ethics, an offshoot of environmental ethics, may seem to be cornered or futile. However, looking more closely at the essential functions of leadership and management, we may find the possibilities of change for the better: change that reverses climate change, or more widely, unsustainability. Conversely, we may find inadequate possibilities for such critical change.\n  \nIn this course, leadership and management are explored to determine their dynamics are and how these afflict our biospheric home\u2014including virtually all life.\u00a0 The course is divided into 4 sections, the 1st is two weeks long, the 2nd and 3rd are each four weeks long, and the 4th is two weeks long.\u00a0 The topic of the 1st section is climate ethics, their content and context:\u00a0 how they work and how they are tripped by surrounding problematic discourses. The topic of the 2nd section is leadership: at its becomingly best, and how it demeans itself with incapability, irresponsibility and corruptibility. The topic of the 3rd section is management: at its operationally best, and how it degrades itself with dysfunctional hierarchy, captive systematization, and offensive behavior.\u00a0 The topic of the 4th section reverts to climate ethics: the necessity of accruing and maintaining value\u2014of the right kind, and the necessity of creating and applying guidance\u2014of the right kind.\u00a0 It is not only because the impacts of problematic ways of doing things are harmful to the biosphere but also because those impacts have others, which are increasingly desperate, rancorous and volatile.",

    "course_descr":"The signing of the Paris Treaty in 2015 signaled a recognition by nearly all the world\u2019s governments of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile, the changing climate is already having negative impacts on business assets and operations around the world. Despite evidence that climate change poses a threat to business as usual for many companies, the financial sector has yet to form a consistent view on how to value risks and opportunities associated with climate change. There are multiple reasons for this. Climate-related disclosures vary widely from company to company, as do the ways that climate risks affect different sectors and geographies. The policy landscape is varied and fast changing. Unfortunately, many financial analysts lack the technical knowledge to assess corporate disclosures and actions pertaining to climate.\n  \nThis 6-week course provides a practical overview of how analysts in the financial sector can assess corporate climate risk and opportunity among publicly traded corporates, using public data. The class will begin with the concept of how business leaders and financial analysts understand climate risk \u2013 alongside other concepts such as decarbonization, transition planning and climate impacts from a policy perspective.\u00a0\n  \nWe will then move to focus on industry-specific analysis in four sectors \u2013 1) oil and gas, 2) consumer staples, 3) mining, and 4) financial services. In each, we will survey the tools that investors have to assess climate risk and opportunity, taking into account policy, voluntary frameworks, and technology. For each of these elements, we will review both how these tools can assist with climate risk analysis as well as their limitations and inconsistencies. We will consider ways the analyst can work with relevant data and reconcile public corporate claims with evidence through corporate disclosures.",

    "course_descr":"Globally, there are over 2 billion people suffering from moderate-to-severe food insecurity, with an estimated 600 million people projected to be chronically undernourished by 2030. One key aspect to understanding food insecurity is its spatial distribution and trends that contribute to how food secure a population is. This course will teach students how to collect and analyze spatial data related to food security, as well as touch on important topics in food insecurity. The course will focus on taking real-life food security questions and applying spatial analysis techniques to these questions. In the course, we will cover an introduction to spatial analysis, natural experiments in geography, applying remote sensing to food insecurity, climate shocks and food security, and seasonal forecasting and food security.\n  \nIt will have an in-class aspect, which will mainly focus on topics in food security and how they relate to data collection, and a lab section which will be an opportunity for students to collect data directly, clean the data, and analyze the data using the R programming language with spatial research methods. Example topics in class will be climate variability and food insecurity, women\u2019s role in agriculture and their rates of food insecurity relative to men, and population and health. These topics will then be further explored in the lab section of the class: specifically focusing on downloading weather data for time series analysis, using a convergence of datasets to map hotspots, and investigating how survey data intersects with spatial datasets.\n  \nIn this course, there will be two components; a lecture and a lab. The lecture will be short and focus on relevant topics in Food Security and methodology used to quantitative analyze these topics. The lab will be a computer-based lab in R, analyzing relevant food security data using techniques discussed during the lecture to provide a practical base for quantitative analyses.",

While it originated in digital web design and user experience, content strategy now encompasses a much broader set of considerations and addresses content creation, distribution, and governance across multiple channels, especially the interplay among digital, social, and traditional media. Content strategy provides a holistic approach for unlocking the value behind content and for increasing its effectiveness in achieving business and organizational objectives. This course will present the fundamentals of content strategy and explore the discipline\u2019s approaches, techniques, and tools that course participants can apply directly to the content situation in their own organization. It will draw parallels with \u2013 and highlight distinctions among \u2013 traditional communication strategy, publishing, and content strategy, and provide students with a framework to create a sustainable program grounded in meaningful, actionable content.",

For many the last gasp of the revolutionary era, for others the beginning of a new regime of flexible control. The hypothesis for this seminar holds that \"1968\" matters for a thinking of the event in two essential ways: not only may we ask what happened but we also should ask how we can talk of the happening of an event in the first place. Alternating theoretical and fictional, historical and artistic, filmic and political materials, students will be expected to develop an original take on one aspect of the paradigm shift that affects the thinking of the events of \u201c1968\u201d during that exceptional month of May in Paris, while keeping a close eye on the national and international contexts behind the global sixties.\n  \nThis summer edition of the course will meet three times per week for two hours each, plus a weekly showing and discussion of a movie related to May 1968 in France and around the globe. In addition, the class will include day trips with a guided tour to the Quartier Latin in relation to May \u201968 as well as the National Archives. To be confirmed are visits by contemporary theorists and philosophers such as Jacques Ranci\u00e8re or Alain Badiou, for whom May 1968 always was and remains a major touchstone event for their view of emancipatory politics.\n  \nTo enroll in this course, you must apply to the\u00a0\nColumbia Summer in Paris\n\u00a0program through the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\u00a0\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships available.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nTuition\u00a0\ncharges apply.\u00a0\n  \nPlease note the program dates are different from the Summer Session Terms.

Countertechnique\u00ae is a system of movement designed for dancers to practice self-direction and to cultivate availability to movement while learning to take risks. Developed over the past 25 years by Dutch choreographer, Anouk Van Dijk, the technique utilizes a task-based approach for body and mind as the vehicle to approach dance. It is a movement system that helps the dancer think with the dancing body by focusing on the process of incorporating anatomical information into action; and beginning to direct and counter-direct the body through space as an alternative to gripping or falling over. Dancers are encouraged to be proactive in discovering connections and solutions, to be less concerned with judging themselves, and to work in a healthy way physically, mentally, and emotionally. The priority is to experience clarity and enjoyment of movement while utilizing the Countertechnique\u00ae principles. \u263a www.countertechnique.com By the end of the semester, students will have a clarified relationship to space; a developed coordination and articulation of the body; they will gain knowledge about the anatomy of the body especially joint structure, location, and range; and will be able to begin Scanning \u2013 the ability to observe one\u2019s own state-of-being and draw upon solutions according to need and\/or experimentation.",

    "course_descr":"Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises such as businesses, non-profits, and governments use data to gain insights and make better decisions. Business analytics is applied in operations, marketing, finance, and strategic planning among other functions. Modern data collection methods \u2013 arising in bioinformatics, mobile platforms, and previously unanalyzable data like text and images \u2013 are leading an explosive growth in the volume of data available for decision making. The ability to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable decisions has been a critical strategic advantage for companies as diverse as Walmart, Google, Capital One, and Disney. Many startups are based on the application of AI & analytics to large databases. With the increasing availability of broad and deep sources of information \u2013 so-called \u201cBig Data\u201d \u2013 business analytics are becoming an even more critical capability for enterprises of all types and all sizes.\n  \nAI is beginning to impact every dimension of business and society. In many industries, you will need to be literate in AI to be a successful business leader. The Business Analytics sequence is designed to prepare you to play an active role in shaping the future of AI and business. You will develop a critical understanding of modern analytics methodology, studying its foundations, potential applications, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 limitations.",

    "course_descr":"This course is designed for students who wish to increase their capability to build, use, and interpret statistical models for business.\nA primary goal of the course is to enable students to build and evaluate statistical models for managerial use in finance, operations and marketing. The focus is on generating managerially useful information and practical decision-making tools, rather than on statistical theory per se. A number of actual business cases are studied.\nConcepts covered are multiple linear regression models and the computer-assisted methods for building them, including stepwise regression and all subsets regression. Emphasis is placed on diagnostic and graphical methods for testing the validity and reliability of regression models.\nCourse topics include a review of basic statistical ideas, numerical and graphical methods for summarizing data, simple linear and nonlinear regression, multiple regression, qualitative independent and dependent variables, diagnostic methods for assessing the validity of statistical models. The course studies applications of regression to business forecasting and also examines alternative times series forecasting models, including exponential smoothing.\nWhile the primary focus of the course is on regression models, some other statistical models will be studied as well, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and goodness-of-fit tests.\nTerm project: A major aspect of course is the opportunity to carry out a practical statistical analysis project of one\u2019s own. Students work in teams on a problem of their own choosing. The goal of the project is to develop a useful statistical model for a specific business problem, with the professor providing ongoing guidance and advice during the course of project. The teams will give an oral presentation of their results at the term\u2019s end. \nExcel is used for basic statistical analysis as well as for developing straightforward regression models. In addition, more advanced commercial statistical software, such as Minitab or SAS, is used to carry out more complex and advanced analyses. In addition to the term project, there will be several computer-based assignments.",

An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology\/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,\" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, \"Firm Boundaries,\" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, \"Internal Operations,\" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, \"New Challenges,\" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.\"",

This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. \nStudents are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the \"laboratory\" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",

Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions.\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nThis course is centered on the concept of \"work.\" The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing.\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nWe begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition\u00a0of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge \u2013\u2013 for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes \"work activity\" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of \"man\" and \"work.\u201d\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nThe course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market \u201cfacts\u201d that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close \"exegesis\" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.",

    "course_descr":"In 1930 Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by the 21st century because he expected we would be at the foothills of the \"economic promised land.\" He was more than right about technological progress and staggering productivity growth \u2013\u2013 but dead wrong about the role work would play in our lives. Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions.\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nThis course is centered on the concept of \"work.\" The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing.\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nWe begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition\u00a0of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge \u2013\u2013 for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes \"work activity\" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of \"man\" and \"work.\u201d\n  \n\u00a0\n  \nThe course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market \u201cfacts\u201d that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close \"exegesis\" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.",

We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a \u201chot-house world\u201d, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future. The non-avian dinosaur met their end in a remarkable cataclysm discovered by detective work that we will delve deeply into as a paradigm of the scientific method\u00a0 Finally, they are fun and spectacular - monsters more fantastic than any person has invented in legend or religion - and they are still with us!",

An analysis of the assumptions underlying the use of climate proxies and their interpretations will be presented. Particular emphasis will be placed on amplifiers of climate change during the alternating ice ages and interglacial intervals of the last few million years, such as natural variations in atmospheric \"greenhouse gases\" and changes in deep water formation rates, as well as mechanisms of rapid climate change during the late Pleistocene. The influence of changes in the Earth's radiation distribution and boundary conditions on the global ocean circulation, Asian monsoon system and El Nino\/Southern Oscillation frequency and intensity, as well as interactions among these systems will be examined using proxy data and models. This course complements GU4937 Cenozoic Paleoceanography and is intended as part of a sequence with GU4330 Terrestrial Paleoclimate for students with interests in Paleoclimate.",

Pressing security issues are also discussed, including peacebuilding in war-torn societies, terrorism, cybersecurity, and weapons of mass destruction.\n  \nThe format of the class combines open-ended lectures and interactive discussions of assigned readings. Each week, students discuss and debate three assigned articles that offer differing interpretations of the global dilemma addressed in the session. Assigned readings are carefully selected to convey of a range of opinions on controversial themes. Restricting the syllabus to several readings per week cannot do justice to the complexity of each topic.\u00a0 However, a realistic reading assignment enables students to fulfill this requirement diligently, and you are expected to do so. Supplementary sources will be suggested, to encourage exploration of specific topics in greater depth.",

Whether constructed in\u00a0order to moralize, to enforce or critique social or political ideologies, or purely to sell copies, \u201ctrue\n crime\u201d is a literary genre that reveals attitudes about gender, race, and class; that illustrates\u2014and sometimes calls into question\u2014cultural norms and mores; that calls on readers to reflect on their own morbid curiosity and assumptions and fears.

Through close reading and critical analysis, we will examine the evolution of the \u201ctrue crime\u201d genre and the cultural and societal contexts that shape the portrayal of crime for popular consumption. We will explore the ways in which texts and authors sensationalize, moralize, and convey the complexities of crime. We will analyze point of view: who\u2019s telling the story, whom we sympathize with, and what insights we get into the minds of those committing crimes as well as those who fall prey to them. We will consider justice and policing\u2014 the role played by the law and its enforcers in shaping narratives about crime and punishment, right and wrong. Finally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of representing real-life crimes in literature, and how \u201ctrue crime\u201d narratives shape social perceptions, fears, prejudices, and notions of justice and morality.",

Our semester\u2019s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare\u2019s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.

How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.

We will talk about the pleasures of those texts, as well as their formal and generic features, their language and their relation to literary history.\u00a0 But we will also discuss the idea and institution named \u201cSally Rooney,\u201d considering it as what Michel Foucault called an \u201cauthor function,\u201d or what Pierre Bourdieu dubbed a \u201cspace of possibilities\u201d within the literary field.\n  \nOur inquiry into \u201cSally Rooney\u201d will, therefore, also be an inquiry into the meaning of literary authorship in the twenty-first century. Through secondary readings in criticism and theory, we will engage longstanding arguments about the relation between critical interpretation and authorial intention, as well as between social and historical \u201ccontext\u201d and authorial and aesthetic autonomy. We will examine how patterns of social exclusion \u2014 in this case, race \u2014 define the digitally-mediated literary field of the present.

Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as \u201cnew television.\u201d That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: \u201cI\u2019d been thinking: it\u2019s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.\u00a0 But lately I\u2019m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.\u00a0 That the best is over,\u201d Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.\u00a0 Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order): \nThe Sopranos\n; \nThe Wire\n; \nDeadwood\n; \nMadmen\n; and \nBreaking Bad.",

Last year's class is a good model for what this year's syllabus will be:\u00a0\nhttp:\/\/coms4170.cs.columbia.edu\/2024-spring\/\n  \n**Attendance required**\n This class is highly interactive, and attendance for many of the lectures is mandatory. Especially in the second half of the class, students must attend in-class project mentoring sessions to get feedback from their TA and fellow students.\n  \n \n**Technical Preparation**\n The first half of the class is quite technical, we introduce principles of usable design and integrate them in to technical assignments. There is a lot of programming in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python (server-side). Whereas we do teach these technologies, we constantly find that students who have seen them before have a better time in class. Former students have advised future students to do an online web programming series like CodeAcademy (which is sadly no longer free). Advanced Programming is an advised pre- requisite, but the true pre-requisite is simply coding experience. You will be expected to figure out some of the programming aspects by yourself, and you need the maturity to do that. Hint: ask GPT. If you are going to email me about this class, please use a subject line\n that says I read the SSOL message for COMS 4170 and I still have a question.

Munro\u2019s award was seen as a literary landmark: the first time that the prize was awarded to a writer whose exclusive form was the short story. The award was seen as fitting recognition, not only for this writer in particular, but also more broadly as moment of recognition for the short story\u2019s importance as a genre, especially in a publishing industry that has long been dominated by the novel.\n  \nIn this course, we will focus on the contemporary North American short story authors featured on our syllabus: Chimamanda Adichie, George Saunders, Lydia Davis, Carmen Machado, Leanne Simpson, Anthony Veasna So. Some of the writers on this list are veterans of the short story form. Others are authors who recently published debut collections. As we work through our reading list, we will attempt to analyze not only individual short stories, but also what marks these books as collections. What might hold these texts together? What disrupts the unifying principles of a collection? And most importantly, what do short stories offer\u2014in terms of representations of American life and culture and itscomplexity\u2014that other forms do not?",

Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman\u2019s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of \u201cwoman\u2019s nature\u201d in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman\u2019s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between \u201cinward impulse and outward fact\u201d? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: \u201cWhat does a woman want?\u201d",

This course will introduce students to a range of habits, practices, and approaches to writing about literature and culture that widen and deepen how one can respond to and interpret a novel, a poem, and various other cultural artifacts. At the same time, we will engage in writing practices that empower students to locate and articulate what interests them about a particular piece of writing or culture, to make a claim about it, and to articulate that claim against other interpretations. Foundational to this endeavor is re-envisioning the writing process, from an isolated, individual process to one that involves collaboration and conversation; copious in-class writing; peer workshops; the power of drafts and revision; and the inclusion of research and theoretical frames. We will use Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s novella Lucy as our main text, accompanied by shorter readings and visits to the museum, Barnard library and archive and other excursions that expand the world of our writing and the objects we wish to understand.",

    "course_descr":"The turn-of-the-century United States was a nation on the cusp of a number of momentous social, cultural, and political movements. One of the biggest changes was in the status and role of women. From the emergence of the New Woman in the last decade of the 19th century, to the suffragette in the 1910s and the flapper in the 1920s, the roles and positions of women were expanding and evolving in unprecedented ways. Coupled with the growth and expansion of cities, women\u2019s mobility and the spaces they occupied changed dramatically during this time period. In this course, we will examine texts that depict the situation of women and their mobility in various social and cultural contexts in the shifting urban landscape of early twentieth-century New York City. What spaces were women allowed\/expected to occupy? What spaces were considered taboo or off limits? What were the effects and consequences of the spaces that women occupied? How did women\u2019s mobility differ to men\u2019s? How do race and class impact mobility and space? What factors influenced women\u2019s mobility and how did these factors change\/develop over time? Course materials will likely include work by Nella Larsen, Djuna Barnes, Sui Sin Far, Anzia Yezierska, Edith Wharton, and Faith Baldwin, as well as the film Skyscraper Souls",

The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums.

Film scholar James Snead describes the film as an \u201callegory of the slave trade\u2026 and of various other forms of exploitation and despoilment.\u201d Snead finds in the monster movie gestures towards the fears of an emancipated Black America as represented by the Harlem Renaissance and even, with its climax at the very top of the Empire State Building, a critique of American Capitalism. How the scholar uncovers, in \nKing Kong, \nanxieties about the city and the wider American experience, emblematizes the \u2018against-the-grain\u2019 approach of this class which asks: what kind of subterranean views of New York City and its taboo\/unseen histories emerge when we look deep into the shadows of the horror genre?\n  \nOur eye will move across the city as well as across film and media history, plunging from the heights of King Kong\u2019s looming skyscraper to Greenwich Village where murderers lurk among our neighbors (\nRear Window\n). We will move from the macabre world of a cruel, sometimes demonic upper class (\nAmerican Psycho\n, \nRosemary\u2019s Baby\n) to the gay cruising scene of the 1970s menaced by slashers who may be hiding in the dancing crowd (\nCruising\n).\n  \nWith its emphasis on field trips, the course will offer a holistic view of an iconic yet always changing city with visits to the top of the Empire State Building and to the Museum of Reclaimed Space. There, we will gain lessons on gentrification\u2019s costs as well as strategies to resist its insidiously flattening force. For our week on Roman Polanski\u2019s \nRosemary\u2019s Baby\n, we will visit the setting of the Dakota Hotel, mulling how the film about a woman who may be giving birth to an otherworldly creature visualizes urban space as a place of profound disconnection. It will mobilize the archival resources of Columbia\u2019s collections around the featured films, so students can appreciate how New York-based critics perceived these films\u2019 representations of the city. To further frame how horror can be a space to explore unsung histories and the impacts of ongoing cultural traumas, acclaimed artists will be invited into the classroom. These include: Pornsak Pichetshote whose graphic novel \nInfidel\n presents the prejudices, paranoias, and fears of post-9\/11 New York in a monstruous light a",

At the conclusion of the course, the student will have gained an appreciation for the role M&A plays on today's corporate landscape and have formed an opinion as to whether or not an M&A transaction makes sense\" for the firm. The student should expect at the conclusion of this course to have gained a level of competency in M&A commensurate with an entry-level investment banking associate in M&A. Whether or not the student \"practices\" M&A, the course will afford the student with an insider's look into what is an undeniable major force on today's corporate landscape. Accordingly, students who are interested in investment banking, consulting, equity research, corporate development, corporate lending, strategic planning, private equity, leveraged finance, or proprietary trading many wish to consider this course.\"",

The field has expanded far beyond the cohort of free-thinking \nphilosophes\n around which it was initially conceived to encompass broader cultural, economic, and religious preoccupations. Given these tendencies, how has the significance of the Enlightenment shifted as a historical period and interpretive framework? In what ways do scholars explicate its origins, outcomes, and legacies? The readings trace the development of Enlightenment thought and practices from their early manifestations in Britain and the United Provinces before shifting attention to France, the geographical focal point of the movement by mid-century. Topics to be addressed include the relationship of traditional political authorities to an emerging public sphere, the invention of society as a means of mediating human relationships, the entrepreneurial and epistemological innovations made possible by new media, the struggles of the \nphilosophe\n movement for legitimacy, debates surrounding luxury consumption and commercial society, the rise of political economy as field of knowledge and practical platform, and arguments between Christian apologists and radical atheists over the status of religious truth.",

    "course_descr":"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",

This course aims to place Latina\/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:\u00a0 Who are Latinas\/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?\u00a0 Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?\u00a0 The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.\u00a0 Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.\u00a0 The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups\u2014Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans.

Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa. Group(s): B, C Field(s): AFR, MEU",

The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,\u00a0 phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A\u00a0 typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor\/client\u00a0 relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a\u00a0 variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or\u00a0 product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and\u00a0 the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and\u00a0 proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.\n  \nSuccessful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the\u00a0 client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on\u00a0 the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to\u00a0 work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual\u00a0 and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing\u00a0 expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability\u00a0 to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.\u00a0 During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,\u00a0 processes, and social factors that promote successful change.\n  \nThis course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external\u00a0 organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives.

Students will learn about fundamental human values and how methods from the behavioral sciences and HCD can inspire ethical use of data to drive strategy and change in the modern, data-driven workplace. Students will understand how keeping \u201chumans in the loop\u201d is beneficial, and they will develop a critical eye for assessing whether the data they rely on to make decisions at work is human-centric, particularly as we become more reliant on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to inform our insights, strategies, and decision making at work.\n  \n Content & Goals: Through hands-on, project-based work, students will work individually and in project teams to practice designing human-centric information and communication experiences, leveraging audience-focused data visualizations and storytelling techniques to drive a strategic workplace objective, motivating leaders and employees into action to create traceable organizational impact that benefits people. Students will have an opportunity to practice their writing and presentation skills through practical course assignments.\n  \n Logistics: This graduate-level elective course is designed for students in Information & Knowledge Strategy but is open to other students at Columbia University. This course would be relevant to students studying management and technology more broadly. The course will be delivered in person on Columbia\u2019s campus during the spring semester.\n  \nNo prerequisites.",

An independent study course allows a student to work one-on-one with a faculty member to gain & contribute new insight into the discipline of Knowledge Management.\n  \nTopic\/objective\n: The topic is chosen by the student as long as it falls within the general realm of Knowledge Management or its specific content areas in the IKNS curriculum, such as IT systems, knowledge organizing systems, data repositories, business data analytics including machine learning & AI, learning processes, collaboration, dialogue, team & project management, transformational leadership, change management, digital transformation, or digital product innovation.

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication. Major themes of study will be: national security fundamentals; concepts of war, conflict, and special operations; and the use of special operations forces over time.",

There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war. The examination of risks to journalists on conflict beats will include detailed case studies of real kidnappings and battlefield deaths, and study examples of risk mitigation and best practices in the field. The course is intended for students with a deep interest in war, terrorism and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners. It aims to promote skepticism of official narratives and critical thinking about journalism itself.",

The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the \u201cGlobal Core.\u201d The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world\u2014where the false binaries of \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe Rest\u201d no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",

We examine the forces that have underpinned\u00a0migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an\u00a0object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a \u2018total social fact\u2019 involving political,\u00a0social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres\u00a0and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with\u00a0questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between\n politics and the arts.\n  \nTo enroll in this course, you must apply to the\u00a0\nColumbia Summer in Paris\n\u00a0program through the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\u00a0\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships available.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nTuition\u00a0\ncharges apply.\u00a0\n  \nPlease note the program dates are different from the Summer Session Terms.

After an early phase of private operatic experiments under the patronage of courts and aristocratic academies, the first public opera house, the San Cassiano Theater, opened its doors in Venice in 1637. As a commercial enterprise, opera rapidly came to dominate the social and cultural life of the city, as Venice grew into one of the most influential and strangely seductive European capitals of music.\n  \nThe course traces the Venetian history of opera from its origins to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Students will also have an opportunity to explore the legacy of this tradition in contemporary Venice as well as in the twentieth-century construction of a nostalgic image of the city\u2019s past musical splendor. Instruction will focus on the relationship between the unique political and topographical organization of Venice and the development of opera. The syllabus integrates academic training with activities designed to allow students to take full advantage of Venice\u2019s historical and cultural resources, including live musical performances, museum visits, and workshops on the workings of Venice\u2019s historical theaters.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n\u00a0\nColumbia in Venice\n\u00a0\nprogram through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships\u00a0\navailable.\u00a0\nTuition\n\u00a0charges apply.\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Sessions Terms.

As the healthcare industry continues to rapidly evolve, it provides immense opportunities for learning and applying concepts, theories and research related to negotiation and conflict resolution in procurement of medical devices and difficult conversations such as advanced directives to name a few. This course is applicable not only to students pursuing careers in health care, but is also designed for students who are interested in applying negotiation skills that they have learned in an environment that can be emotionally charged and conceptually complex.\u00a0\n  \nThroughout this course students will be given the opportunity to apply the skills they have learned from previous classes as well as solidify key concepts including but not limited to negotiation preparation, quantitative\/qualitative analysis, influence, social cognition, asymmetrical information, and conflict resolution in a healthcare context. This course is designed to challenge each student to harness their critical thinking skills, uncover nuances and recognize the complexities associated with multiparty negotiations in healthcare. This course aims to enable students to develop and implement strategic processes that help bring parties together and promote new perspectives that will bridge the gap between the classroom and real-life scenarios.\u00a0\n  \nDuring the course, students will gain insight into the history of the US healthcare system as well as the changing dynamics associated with the Health Care Reform, and end of life discussions. This course will emphasize the role of negotiations from multiple perspectives and will utilize an expert panel videos of such subject matter experts as hospital administrators\/executives, physicians and medical device manufacturers in order to provide historical case studies as well as review real-life negotiations. Students will actively engage in negotiation planning and role plays, read case studies and other materials about negotiation and the healthcare field, as well as, use industry software to help them prepare for negotiations.",

A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Applying conflict resolution constructs and frameworks such as interdependence, intergroup conflict, social identity, bias, peacebuilding, power dynamics, culture, and negotiation frameworks, are among the key learnings integrated into the course.\n  \nThe competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life.

We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",

    "course_descr":"NECR 5270 is a three-credit summer practicum course designed to expose students to the role of social justice in conflict resolution analysis and practice, using New York City as our laboratory. Each summer, we will focus on a single, challenging question facing NYC at the intersection of conflict resolution and social justice, including how to respond to gang violence, how to address inequality, how to manage immigration and more. Within the chosen topic, we will explore the historical and theoretical intersections between the fields of social justice and conflict resolution, drawing on our conflict analysis and resolution skills to explore concrete policy options and community strategies. The course builds on the historical connection between conflict resolution and social justice, particularly as it emerged during the civil rights movement, where nonviolent resistance and negotiation were used to challenge systemic oppression. It also draws on the foundational work of Morton Deutsch at Columbia University, whose research on cooperation, competition, and social justice highlights how power imbalances can perpetuate conflict. Through critical dialogue, case study analysis, and practitioner-led workshops, students will develop culturally sensitive, sustainable, and community-centered.\n  \nWe will focusing on needs-based strategies for addressing gang violence in New York City, while critically examining the role of bias in our work as conflict resolution scholars and practitioners. Students will analyze the social, economic, and psychological factors that drive individuals toward gang involvement, and learn about gang structures and the role of gang rivalries in driving crime. In addition to classroom learning, students will participate in fieldwork designed to expose them to experts, policymakers, activists, and practitioners working directly on issues related to gang violence in New York City. These immersive experiences will offer opportunities to engage with real-world challenges while critically reflecting on how biases\u2014both personal and systemic\u2014affect the implementation of violence prevention strategies and conflict resolution efforts. Fieldwork activities may include visits to local violence prevention programs, meetings with law enforcement officials focused on reducing bias in community engagement, and discussions with activists leading restorative justice initiatives. By integrating theoretical knowledge with practical experiences, students will be equipped to design innovative, needs",

The course will help prepare them for future careers as an NGO leader, staff person, consultant, analyst, donor, or manager. Students will understand how NGOs are structured and the definition and differences between key concepts such as strategy, theory of change, governance, leadership, management, and program design.\n  \nThe course will bring a scholar-practitioner perspective focusing on debates about strategy development, measuring impact, donor strategies, theories of change, institutional representation, diversity and equity, ethics, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement, campaigning, capacity-building, fundraising, resilience, sustainability, and external and internal communications.\n  \nThe course will explore distinctions, similarities, and relationships among nongovernmental (national and international), government, and private actors as they seek to solve problems and have impact and create a better world. Throughout this exploration, we will identify major ethical issues raised by the very notions of charity, philanthropy and nonprofits. As a focus, the course will especially draw on examples from the international human rights movement, and often critically employ a \u201cdonor perspective\u201d to draw out the hard strategic choices that INGOs (and their donors) are compelled to make. The course will also use documentary film about INGOs and their work, and various media produced about and by INGOs to help provide additional understanding.\n  \nThe course will be discussion intensive and require students to utilize and reflect critical and analytical thinking; students will write individual papers, participate in group presentations, write occasional reflection papers, actively participate in discussion both in class and through postings on Canvas and present material to classroom colleagues.\n  \nThis is an elective course in the M.S. Nonprofit Management Program and will be open, space permitting,\u00a0 to cross-registrants.\n  \nThe course will draw on material from the management course offered as part of the core curriculum.

We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds. The section will conclude with problems about the metaphysics of socially constructed kinds such as race or gender.",

    "course_descr":"Six major concepts of political philosophy including authority, rights, equality, justice, liberty and democracy are examined in three different ways. First the conceptual issues are analyzed through contemporary essays on these topics by authors like Peters, Hart, Williams, Berlin, Rawls and Schumpeter. Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau. Third some attention is paid to relevant contexts of application of these concepts in political society, including such political movements as anarchism, international human rights, conservative, liberal, and Marxist economic policies as well as competing models of democracy.",

This course introduces the theory, evidence, and practice of several common forms of soft tissue mobilization. The class begins with traditional massage that rely on basic theory and progresses to advanced techniques based on principles derived from current fascial theory. Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply soft tissue mobilizations that impact musculoskeletal system impairment of the upper-extremity, lower- extremity, and trunk. Along the way, students apply evidence-based practice concepts and knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, soft tissue pathophysiology in the experiential learning and discussion-based learning approach. Ultimately, students will be able to make logical clinical decisions that integrate soft tissue mobilization into an effective plan of care.

Students will begin by reviewing in the first week of the course the basic science of Climate Change and then studying the roots of our understanding of nature, including a variety of ancient religious texts and a wide range of Creation Narratives from around the globe. The second week of the course will be an introduction to a critical examination of artistic responses to Climate Change in recent decades. This will include Land Art that questions and tests our control over the landscape, a century of films that feature natural disaster scenarios, dystopian poems and short stories, music that seeks to represent the challenges of climate change in the auditory dimension, paintings and sculptures that visualize global warming, and performance art that uses the human body to dramatize the ways in we have been transforming nature. In the third week of the course, students will be exposed to the history of environmentalism itself before spending the final sessions in groups producing their own artistic responses to Climate Change.",

This seminar will consider how capital, gender, race, culture, and power shape understandings of Wall Street in the popular imagination, and how people\u2019s everyday practices reshape that understanding. Drawing on a variety of texts \u2013anthropological, sociological, political-economic, historical, literary, and cinematic \u2013 we will examine the ways new forms of capital produce financial subjects, class difference, and crisis, within the global economy. We will also explore the ways Occupy Wall Street, Me Too, Black Lives Matter and other social movements are recapturing the radical imagination and the possibilities of new forms of resistance to capitalism that often intersect with sexism, racism, and other systems of power. Using interdisciplinary methodologies such as fieldwork, archival research, and literary analysis students will produce short papers and one research paper that allows them to take advantage of conducting research in New York City.",

In doing so, we will read the work of major representatives of historical and contemporary political thought who assessed democracy\u2019s shortcomings and potential, examined the relationship between its theory and its practice, and offered prominent resources for thinking about democracy\u2019s future in our present.",

Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the \u201cleast dangerous branch,\u201d making law, not policy, without real power or influence.\n  \nOur thematic questions will be: \u00a0How much power and discretion do judges have in the U.S? \u00a0What drives their decision-making?",

To explore this phenomenon, students will engage with a variety of media\u2014such as podcasts, documentaries, and memoirs\u2014alongside scholarly articles from fields like cognitive neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology. Drawing on case studies centered on the lived experience of hallucinations, we will investigate how key theories of the mind and brain influence the interpretation of first-person accounts and how, in turn, these accounts challenge and refine these theories. Guest lectures will enhance the case studies by presenting current and future directions in hallucination research. By integrating interdisciplinary academic research with first-person perspectives, this course offers students the opportunity to critically examine how knowledge of the mind and brain is constructed and how it can be applied in real-world contexts.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n\u00a0\nColumbia Summer Program: Global Neuroscience\n\u00a0\nprogram through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships\u00a0\navailable.\u00a0\nTuition\n\u00a0\ncharges apply.\u00a0\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Sessions Terms.

    "course_descr":"Psychedelics are receiving growing attention in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience for their therapeutic potential. Psychedelic compounds like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT produce a wide range of changes to perception, ranging from visual perception to alterations in one\u2019s sense of self. When combined with psychological support or psychotherapy, psychedelics have been shown to lead to rapid and long-lasting therapeutic benefits for a wide range of mental health disorders, including major depression and alcohol use disorder. The acute alterations in perception and long-lasting clinical effects offer exciting insight into the relationship between the mind and the brain. This course will focus on the current state of research on the psychological and neurobiological effects of psychedelics. We will begin with a crash-course into the basics of neuroscience and research methodology. Next, the course will delve into how psychedelics alter brain functioning, both acutely during the drug effects as well as long after they have worn off. Studies covered will span molecular, cellular, and systems level analysis. A core element of the course will include reviewing methodological approaches and neuroscientific evidence for psychedelics interventions in the treatment of clinical\/psychiatric disorders. We will also review the clinical data and link neurobiological findings to their practical application to move the field of psychedelic science forward. Throughout the course, there will be a specific focus on critical appraisal of research, identifying strengths and limitations surrounding current research, and important avenues for future research. Students should leave the class with an enhanced ability to evaluate research findings and a broad understanding of the mechanisms of action of psychedelics.\n  \nThe format of the course will include lectures, class discussions and presentations, and guest speakers.\n  \nPrerequisites: \nPSYC 1001 and any PSYC 2400-level neuroscience course or permission of the instructor.",

Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed. The methods introduced in this course will provide a toolkit with which to help measure and estimate the relationships between the smaller pieces that comprise the complex and dynamic web of systems in public health.",

This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",

In this class \u2013 through readings and a dozen hands-on activities \u2013 students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI\u2019s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people\u2019s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI\u2019s \u201cweirdness.\u201d Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills \u2013 like in critical thinking and empathy \u2013 in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, \u201cSo far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1\/36th of the time, thanks to AI.

These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class.

In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution.\u00a0Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis.\u00a0\n  \nThe proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.\u00a0 It aims to:\n  \n1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.\n  \n2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.\n  \n3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.\n  \n4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.\n  \n5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",

Many of the techniques of CBA can also be applied to private sector decision-making. The objective of CBA is to determine whether the benefits of a particular program, policy or decision outweigh its costs. The techniques used to determine this are sometimes quite simple, but on other, increasingly frequent occasions are highly sophisticated. Sophisticated cost benefit studies are based on a framework that utilizes the basic concepts of economic theory. In addition, statistical and econometric analyses are often needed to estimate program effects from diverse available data. The course has two parts: methodology and practice. The goal is for students to be practically adept to undertake an independent cost-benefit analysis.",

Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world\u2019s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2\u00b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.\n  \nStudents in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries, \u00a0data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.\n  \nThis course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",

We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm. The course also provides a practical introduction to selected non-financial accounting topics including sustainability reporting standards, ESG corporate performance indicators and corporate social responsibility report (CSR Reporting).",

    "course_descr":"Throughout history, societies have discovered resources, designed and developed them into textiles,\n  \ntools and structures, and bartered and exchanged these goods based on their respective values.\n  \nEconomies emerged, driven by each society\u2019s needs and limited by the resources and technology\n  \navailable to them. Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the\n  \noverextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast\n  \ntechnological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of\n  \nthe disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a \u201ctake-make\u2019-\n  \nwaste\u201d manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our\n  \nplanet\u2019s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological\n  \nadvancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;\n  \nwhich begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?\n  \nThe premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative\n  \neconomic future are available to us. By looking at resources\u2019 potential, we can shape alternative methods\n  \nof procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,\n  \nproducts and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into\n  \nboth the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and\n  \nrestoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications\n  \nrequired in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially\n  \ntransformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic\n  \nstructures, systems and processes.\n  \nThis is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability\n  \nleaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us\n  \n(as rapidly as we need) into a more sustaining future. The class will be comprised of a series of lectures,\n  \nsupported by readings and case-studies on business models, design thinking and materi",

Analyzing global North and South cities, course themes focus on the politics of street food, food trucks, restaurants, markets, farmers\u2019 markets, food deserts, food assistance programs, urban farming and agriculture, gastronomic gentrification, and food delivery services. This course comprises a mixture of active teaching strategies, short lectures, a film, and several field trips throughout New York City. By the end of the course, students will garner a deep understanding of how food and societies influence, and are shaped by, contemporary global cities.",

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",

From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong \u201cnut graph,\u201d to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into \u201cthe field\u201d (of New York City) to craft their own.

This course will introduce students to the elements that shape YA novels, and explore the fiction writing techniques needed for long projects, including narrative arcs, character construction, worldbuilding, and scene work. We\u2019ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.\n  \nStudents will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",

    "course_descr":"People like to be liked. And writers obsess about likability in fiction. But is it that important? What about visionaries, iconoclasts, stragglers, strangers, weirdos, and cringe-inducers? What happens when there is friction between a person and their surroundings? Between people? What if a character throws aside motivations to be liked and impulses to comply?\n  \nAt its heart, this is a class focused on analyzing and crafting characters. We\u2019ll look at loners and lonely hearts, articulate big mouths, and introverted self-imploders. We\u2019ll observe their circumstances and question how their desires encourage them to think and act. Students will regularly respond to prompts and workshop their own writing.\n  \nOur discussions will consider what choices writers make to render, shape, define, and refine characters. We\u2019ll take on craft-oriented concerns such as: How is dialogue used to differentiate characters? How does a writer demonstrate a character\u2019s compassion, even if their attitude stinks? How do the story's events affect the reader\u2019s understanding of character? What elements in the narrative change\u2014or don\u2019t\u2014over time to signal to the reader that a character is developing?\n  \nThroughout, students will investigate how emerging writers move from maintaining characters\u2019 status quo and progress to allowing characters to do the unexpected. With every question, we will advance our comprehension of building dynamic representations of people in the world, how they act out, and what it takes to fit in.\n  \nReadings may include:\n  \nNights at the Circus\n by Angela Carter, \nGeek Love\n by Katherine Dunn, \u201cSpeech Sounds\u201d by Octavia Butler, \nMcGlue \nby Ottessa Moshfegh, \nTrue Grit \nby Charles Portis, \nDistant Star\n by Roberto Bola\u00f1o, \nHome Land\n by Sam Lipsyte,\n CivilWarLand in Bad Decline\n by George Saunders, \u201cFriday Black\u201d by Nana Kwame Adje Brenya, \u201cEmergency\u201d by Denis Johnson, \u201cTall Tales from the Mekong Delta\u201d by Kate Braverman, \u201cMe and Miss Mandible\u201d by Donald Barthelme, \nThe Book of Goose\n by Yiyun Li,\u00a0\nMezzanine \nby Nicholson Baker, \nWittgenstein's Mistress\n by David Markson, \nNo Longer Human\n by Osamu Dazai",

Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a \u201cmilieu\u201d of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",
