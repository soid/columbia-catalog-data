This course, 0s and 1s, considers the epilogue of the history of numbers: “Where did ‘Numbers’ bring us.” Today, the study of the art historian is flooded with an endless stream of visual, numerical, and electronic data. Computers and mobile devices offer sophisticated renderings of remote objects of art, spaces, and architecture. Digital technologies provide unprecedented means of analysis and research.  At the same time, however, new technologies bear on the overall direction art and architectural research is taking. This course investigates pros and cons of the new digital methods for art and architectural history. In this course, students will have the opportunity to learn the difference between observing art and architecture through digital media and direct contact with physical objects during museum visits at the Cloisters and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through the analysis of new methods for studying art and architecture from Europe and the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages, this course aims at introducing students to computational and digital art history.",Stefaan Van Liefferinge,1:00pm,4:10pm,72396,Morningside,S3219-20172-001,COMP APP TO STUDY OF MED ART,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623103938/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3219-20172-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

and
 implicit depictions of dance.  From this point of departure, we will ask why the performing arts exert such a force upon how we experience and interpret a wide range of figures and figural compositions.  More specific questions will arise in relationship to the following themes: the impact of Antiquity, the simultaneous rise of art and dance theory, the representation of music and time, parallels between composition and choreography, the concept of grace, dance and religion, the depiction of violence, and the modern viewers informative eye.  Ultimately, the class aims to nurture a productive exchange between students from different departments, as well as foster the potential for pushing interdisciplinary study to its limits.  Lectures, discussions, and readings will be complemented by trips to museums, libraries, and performances.",Olivia S Powell,5:30pm,8:40pm,68348,Morningside,S3306-20172-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/8347,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170809215640/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3306-20172-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

In the classroom, in the archival collections of Avery Library and in numerous field trips around the city and the phot, we will analyze these structures and milieux from the perspective of architectural history and urban design, trace their origins and development from the founding of the city to the present and look at how they have helped cut across but also harden class lines. We will examine the formal differences between high-brow and popular venues, discuss the problems of private and public patronage, as well as the financial and social impact of the entertainment industry on the wellbeing of the city as a whole. Above all, we will explore the ways in which places of play, recreation and escape have shaped the identity of and created a distinct look for New York, which, despite the enormous revenue that the culture and entertainment industry generates, are often at odds with the city's reality.",Irina T Oryshkevich,1:00pm,4:10pm,77260,Morningside,S3409-20172-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/240,silver,11.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623104051/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3409-20172-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.  Class lectures and presentations will be supplemented with trips to New York's world-renowned museums.",Kent M Minturn,1:00pm,4:10pm,66715,Morningside,S3426-20172-001,JACKSON POLLOCK & NY SCH,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/353,silver,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623104052/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3426-20172-001/,934 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3430,John Singleton Copley to Kehin,"Through an examination of painting, sculpture, photography and the visual culture of the United States fiĀ·om the colonial era to present day, this course will explore the role that American artists played in creating a national identity through the genre of portraiture. The class will consider how portraits speak to the political, economic and cultural moments of their production and what they reveal about their sitters' positions in American society. Examining a range of imagery from depictions of colonial merchants by John Singleton Copley, the faces of George Washington, George Catlin's Indian Gallery, and the scions of John Singer Sargent's Gilded Age, to the mixed-media portraits of the Stieglitz Circle, the photographs of Diane Arbus, and Kehinde Wiley's ""street castings,"" the class investigates the role of art in attempting to capture American character. Discussing an array of self portraits from James McNeil Whistler and Andy Warhol to Lily Martin Spencer and Cindy Sherman, the class also considers the unique qualities and challenges faced by the American artist. Particularly relevant after therecent election, the course questions the possibility of depicting American identity, given the changing circumstances under which that identity has been defined since the origins of the nation.

AHIS S3601,Outliers: How the Frontier,"This seminar investigates how the frontier  influenced Chinese art, daily life, and beliefs from the Han (206 BCE-220 cE) to the early Ming (1368-1644) dynasties. Imperial China often used defensive walls and pointed rhetoric  to draw distinctions  between itself and neighboring powers, but material evidence shows that cross-cultural exchange along the frontiers  was vibrant and mutual. Geography played a dynamic role in these interactions. The Tibet-Qinghai plateau to the southwest, Gobi Desert to the north, and Pacific Ocean to the east buffered China, but also facilitated interactions  that penetrated  deep into its territory and society. Architecture, paintings, sculpture, ceramics, textiles, and metal works from a range of historical junctures demonstrate how people along the border regions adopted new technologies and materials as well as novel concepts and forms of expression. These underscore the complex and persistent role of the frontiers  in shaping Chinese art and culture.",Heather D Clydesdale,9:00am,12:10pm,74762,Morningside,S3601-20172-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623104056/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3601-20172-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S3009,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF ISLAM,"What does it mean to be a pious or secular Muslim in the Middle East today? How is this complex identity inhabited, embodied, expressed, nurtured, redefined, contested and debated in the contemporary Middle East?  What kinds of ongoing debates about shari'a and authority are constitutive of Islam as a discursive tradition?  Through what forms of embodied practices and dispositions do women involved in a mosque movement in Cairo seek to become pious subjects?  What does it mean to be secular in Turkey?  Or a young person born after the revolution in Iran?  How does a Moroccan anthropologists teaching at Princeton University experience and reflect on his pilgrimage to Mecca?  We will think about these and other related questions through a series of recent anthropological texts that deal with questions of piety, secularity, modernity and subjectivity among Muslims in the contemporary Middle East.",Sonia Ahsan,5:30pm,8:40pm,71996,Morningside,S3009-20172-001,ANTHROPOLOGY OF ISLAM,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3513,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170629004336/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3009-20172-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S3722,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VIOLENCE,"This course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to the issue of violence with an exploration of three particular themes. Our main focus will be on the idea of representation, ethnographically and theoretically, of the concept of violence. First, we will look at how violence has been situated as an object of study within anthropology, as a theoretical concept as well as in practice. We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality. We will pay particular attention to the concept of the ""Muslim woman"" in both the colonial and colonized imagination.",Ellen Marakowitz,1:00pm,4:10pm,28655,Morningside,S3722-20172-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3387,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623090910/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3722-20172-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S4187,WOMEN & GENDER IN SOUTH ASIA,"This course is an ethnographic and historical introduction to the construction of gender and feminist theory in the South Asian context. We will focus on textual and visual material, primarily ethnographies and films, to provide a critique of normative representations of the ""South Asian woman"". These readings will be used to reveal the complex social and historical configurations that institute and obscure gendered experiences and representations within the colonial imagination and their colonized others. A significant motif of this course will be to develop alternative ways of knowing and understanding gender construction, sexual relations, and community formation in South Asia.",Sonia Ahsan,5:30pm,8:40pm,63085,Morningside,S4187-20172-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3513,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623090916/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S4187-20172-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

CLEN S3851,HUMAN RIGHTS IN WORLD LIT & VISUAL CUL,"This course explores human rights issues in contemporary novels, films, and short stories from Africa and the Caribbean as well as humanitarian-inspired art, films, television, and music videos circulated around the world. When postcolonial writers and cultural producers decide to represent violence in their countries, they risk reproducing racist stereotypes that permeate international media. And yet, violations of basic human rights tied to civil war, sexual violence, religious fanaticism, and ethnic strife are intimate features of their national histories. How can postcolonial writers undermine the harmful stereotypes and dominant narratives that predetermine their stories in the international public sphere without reproducing stereotypes? To better understand strife abroad, we will take an interdisciplinary feminist approach to the politics of representing human rights. Our readings, paired with options for poetry slams, film screenings, and walking tours in New York City, will prompt us to reflect critically on the ambivalences surrounding human rights in our own U.S. culture. We will engage literary representations of historical events ranging from the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, and the Rwandan genocide, all the way up to Black Lives Matter and Islamophobia in the wake of Trump's election. Final projects invite students to reflect on methods for representing human rights through creative writing and literary zine-making. This course, which fulfills the University Global Core requirement, as well as English major requirements for prose fiction/narrative and comparative/global literature, will appeal to students not only literature but also in human rights, history, political science, African studies, law, and gender and sexuality studies.",Nicole M Gervasio,1:00pm,4:10pm,94691,Morningside,S3851-20172-001,HUMAN RIGHTS IN WORLD LIT,Classics,CLEN,http://localhost:8801/professors/12804,gold,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170905184735/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/S3851-20172-001/,309 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

It places particular emphasis on the themes of the polis, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces - complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages - and ask: How central is the classical past in Western imagination?

We will discuss tales by such extraordinary authors as Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Peter Carey, Vikram Chandra, Eduardo Galeano, James Kelman, Ian McEwan, Mohammed Mrabet, Haruki Murakami, Jeanette Winterson, and Can Xue (besides leading writers of the U.S.) These stories cover the gamut of modern experience in diverse cultures and represent an equally broad range in terms of narrative style and tone. We will zero in on a number of fundamental questions: How do these stories illuminate different dimensions of social life in our complex, globalized world? How do the readings vary depending on the author's home culture or exposure to various cultures? Do certain themes or forms of storytelling emerge as ""universal""? How do these tales explore ethical values, and what lessons might we learn from them with respect to our challenging contemporary modes of living?

EMPA U7225,ETHICS FOR PUBLIC LEADERSHIP & MANAGEMEN,"The purpose of this course is to examine corruption in public life to determine what transformative ethical measures can be taken by public leaders to promote organizational, societal and environmental sustainability instead. Corruption critically impedes human rights, humanitarian aid and economic development, in addition to the rule of law and the administration of justice. Effective management requires an understanding of soft or relational corruption, including narcissistic leadership, discriminatory worldviews, complicit loyalty and technocratic authority. It also requires an understanding of hard or material corruption, including more obvious forms of conflict of interest, ranging from gifts and bribes, to self-dealt compensation and investment, besides nepotism, cronyism and favoritism; and less obvious forms of conflict of interest, ranging from undue influence to campaign contributions, voter suasion and lobbyist support, in exchange for regulatory loopholes, waivers, earmarks, bailouts, subsidies, permits and contracts, besides perquisites such as honoraria, board directorships and revolving-door career advancements. Expectations for civil discourse and the integrity of civil society are also examined in the course, as are appropriate anti-corruption measures. These include a range of measures such as transparency, inclusivity, financial disclosure and whistle-blower protection. The relevant structures are public, non-profit and for-profit organizations, operative and influential anywhere along the continuum from local to global administration. The course aims to model the public leader, using ethical building blocks of sensitivity and rationality, among them empathy and authenticity. Cases are used to illustrate various kinds of corruption and to demonstrate how a public leader can remediate corrupt practices to achieve ethical outcomes. Ethical approaches available to managers are intended to help secure their organizations against disarray, waste, ineffectiveness and disintegration, while also securing the socio-ecological environment. Some ethical dilemmas may persist: personal interest, institutional limitations and socio-cultural constraints. Yet ethical approaches can nonetheless serve to achieve public good.",Adela J Gondek,2:10pm,4:00pm,62846,Morningside,U7225-20172-001,ETHICS FOR PUB LEADERSHIP,International and Public Affairs,EMPA,http://culpa.info/professors/5093,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623175853/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EMPA/U7225-20172-001/,801 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,TWRTWRT,20172EMPA7225U001,SEMINAR
EMPA U7490,NEGOTIATION & CONFLICT RESOLUTION,"Professional success, sustainable institutional relationships and the creation of value all fundamentally derive from the capacity of professionals to negotiate, collaborate and resolve conflict. This is equally the case in the private sector, international organizations, civil society, non-governmental organizations, and government. Regardless of the context, people need competencies, behaviors, strategies and mindsets to negotiate. Therefore, this course builds the critical negotiation and conflict resolution competencies (skills, knowledge and attitudes) that Executive MPA students need in order to effectively, efficiently, and creatively negotiate in their work contexts. This highly experiential course will increase students' awareness of negotiation and conflict dynamics. It will help students improve their own negotiation and conflict resolution skills, so that they can be more effective professionals. These skills are relevant both with external counterparts, as well as within organizations, as managers, colleagues, with superiors and key stakeholders. While a range of approaches to negotiation will be discussed, this course focuses on collaborative, interest-based negotiation and its application to a wide range of negotiation contexts, from everyday interactions to organizational change or conflicts situations. The course will deal with concepts, analytical tools and techniques needed for negotiation and conflict resolution in contexts relevant to the participants. The course will also critique these approaches and discuss a range of concerns and dilemmas. The course uses a dynamic mix of pedagogical methods, including lectures, small group activities, exercises and games, reflection and analysis, facilitated discussions, films, cases studies, expert guest speakers, and role-playing.",Zachary B Metz,9:00am,1:00pm,62896,Morningside,U7490-20172-001,NEGOTIATION & CONFLICT RESOLUT,International and Public Affairs,EMPA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623175853/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EMPA/U7490-20172-001/,324 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,TWRTWR,20172EMPA7490U001,SEMINAR

ENGL S3233,SHAKESPEARE,"This course provides an introduction to Shakespeare through a combination of reading his plays and viewing them in performance.  On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology.  On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage.  Our semesterâ€™s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to 
Hamlet
, Shakespeareâ€™s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human.  We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.  We read 8 plays in all, including 
Titus Andronicus
, 
Midsummer Night's Dream
, 
Julius Caesar
, 
Macbeth

ENGL S3261,ENGLISH LITERATURE TO 1500,"Geoffrey Chaucer may be constructed as the “Father of English Poetry,” but his works imply a far more radical and unorthodox figure, grounded in a particular historical moment, than the epithet suggests. This course explores the intriguing and often open-ended social, political, and moral questions Chaucer raises in the 
Canterbury Tales
. Complicating the idea of Chaucer as a traditional poet, this course will introduce you to critical trends in medieval literary scholarship, centering on issues of class, gender, sexuality, and nationalism in relation to Chaucer’s tales. We will explore the dynamic tale-telling of the Canterbury pilgrims, with special attention to how the tales they tell on the road to Canterbury Cathedral draw upon the texts Chaucer used to shape the world of his own book. You will read excerpts from source texts and analogues, such as Boethius’s 
Consolation of Philosophy 
and Boccaccio’s 
Decameron
, to develop a sense of the rich traditions in which Chaucer was writing and innovating. These supplementary works will illuminate the conversations Chaucer was having with other poets and philosophers, and the way in which he used past writings to form his position in late fourteenth-century debates and to shape his literary legacy.",Gillian R Adler,1:00pm,4:10pm,86596,Morningside,S3261-20172-001,CHAUCERS SONDRY FOLK:THE CANTE,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623171547/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3261-20172-001/,201B Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3273,AMERICAN LIT. & CUL: WALT WHITMAN & NY,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York.  But he was the first of many to let New York write him.  By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of 
Leaves of Grass
, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet?  This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment.  Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself.  Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered 
Life and Adventures of Jack Engle
) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.  Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,68282,Morningside,S3273-20172-001,WHITMAN AND NEW YORK CITY,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/77,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623171548/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3273-20172-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3483,RELATIONALITY IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN P,"Much of American culture and literature emerges from a tradition that celebrates individualism and self-determination. Yet identity is a complex product of conscious and unconscious interconnections within the social and biological environment, increasingly dependent on global influences that supplant individual and national autonomy. These forces, especially when intensified by personal loss and tragedy, unsettle ideals of personal independence and generate desire for relation and connection. In this course, we will examine contemporary American fictional and nonfictional texts that embrace vulnerability, dependency, attachment, and solidarity and foster a reorientation towards relational concepts of identity. Siri Hustvedt’s novel 
What I Loved
 deconstructs boundaries between self and other on multiple discursive levels, drawing on philosophy, psychoanalysis, neuroscience, art, and medicine. Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir 
Are You My Mother? 
and Maggie Nelson’s memoir 
The Argonauts 
both return to Donald Winnicott’s relational psychoanalysis in their explorations of queer desire and family bonds. Audre Lorde’s foundational 
The Cancer Journals 
and Eve Ensler’s 
In the Body of the World 
illustrate how the broken and abject body can become a medium of self-actualization and connection. Richard Powers’ 
Galatea 2.2

ENGL S3714,MAJOR AMERICAN AUTHORS,"“What is he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. “A writer of story-books! What kind of a business in life,—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation,—may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler! - Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Custom House” (1850) , Fiction is one of the fine arts, deserving in its turn of all the honors and emoluments that have hitherto been reserved for the successful profession of music, poetry, painting, architecture. It is impossible to insist too much on so important a truth. - Henry James, “The Art of Fiction” (1884) , In any discussion of the novel, one must make it clear whether one is talking about the novel as a form of amusement, or as a form of art. […] Amusement is one thing; enjoyment of art is another. - Willa Cather, “The Novel Démeublé” (1922) , Can fiction be an art? While we may be inclined to say “yes” today, in the nineteenth century the reputation of fiction writing – novels, tales, short stories, and sketches – was by no means so secure. Novelists were more likely to be considered entertainers or “story- tellers” than serious artists, and novels were usually thought of as frivolous at best and immoral at worst, and certainly not worthy of serious scrutiny or consideration. How did the reputation of fiction writing in America develop such that novels could be considered certifiably “artistic?”This course examines the novels, short fiction, and critical writings of three important American writers: Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, and Willa Cather. While very different in very many ways, these three authors shared a belief that fiction was a serious business, and every bit as much an art as painting, poetry, sculpture, music, or other “fine” arts. They also all shared an interest in representing these various fine arts and the artists that make them in their novels and stories, often using the figure of the painter, the sculptor, the actor, or the singer in order to explore, develop, and justify their own fictional practice. In other words, this class will examine “the art of fiction” in at least two ways: both by looking at the representation of art and artists in the fiction of these three writers, and also by examining how such representations help these writers to make fiction an art in its own right. This course asks: This course asks: What ideas about the “fine arts” led to the exclusion of novels?

Middlemarch
, widely regarded as “the best English novel,” George Eliot was hailed by her successor Henry James as “one of the noblest, most beautiful minds of our time.”  This course will engage Eliot not only as a consummate author of nineteenth-century realist fiction but also as an ethical philosopher.  Her novels explore the questions, “How should one live?” “What is the right thing to do?” “What is one’s obligation to the other?” while rejecting moral didacticism.  We will read four of Eliot’s masterpieces along with brief excerpts from her essays and from philosophers Spinoza, Feuerbach, J.S. Mill, Spencer, and G.H. Lewes, all of whom critically influenced Eliot’s thinking. For Eliot, the novel serves as a vehicle for ethical inquiry; without “lapsing from the picture to the diagram,” her rich narrative portrayal of character and social intercourse gives “flesh and blood” to philosophical dilemmas, bringing home to readers the real consequences of moral choice and action. The major issues of Victorian debate, including utilitarianism, sympathy, early sociology, faith, and feminism, will inform our study.",Aileen G Forbes,5:30pm,8:40pm,92246,Morningside,S3802-20172-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/9680,,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623171550/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3802-20172-001/,401 ALFRED LERNE,,"Barnard

ENGL S4401,18TH CENTURY & ROMANTIC POETRY,"This course is a study of romantic poetry and poetics but does not approach its subject from the belated perspective of the Victorians or the Moderns. Instead, the famous Romantics of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are viewed proleptically, from the vantage point of early and mid 18th-century poets who established the modern criteria and generated the forms and ideas later ingeniously personalized by the poets we customarily refer to as the Romantics. Indeed, though we shall spend the concluding half of our study with Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats, our study begins with the neoclassical romanticism of Pope, Thomson, Akenside, the Wartons, Gray, and Goldsmith. As such, our reading entails a study of lyric trends bridging 18th - and 19th - century verse and of related discourses in aesthetic psychology, moral philosophy, experimental religion, natural description, and affective criticism. We shall attend closely to rhetorical and prosodic elements, with a view to characteristic genres (ode, epistle, georgic, epitaph), innovative hybrids and new forms (elegy, the ""conversational"" poem).

Focusing on representative texts that define and redefine the medium, we will learn how to approach comics as a distinct literary and visual form, while familiarizing ourselves with the critical vocabulary of ""sequential art."" By examining the graphic novel with an eye toward the literary, the course will explore a variety of genres and the ways they deploy conventional literary forms such as allegory, epic, character, setting, symbolism, and metaphor. We will consider how comics resist, represent, and entrench dominant cultural ideologies about power, myth, heroism, humor, adolescence, gender, sexuality, family, poverty, religion, censorship, and the immigrant experience. The course will provide students with the critical tools to read this key vehicle of contemporary creative expression. Readings will include seminal works and newer classics, by Gaiman, Bell, Miller, Moore, Crumb, Bell, Spiegelman, Ware, Derf, and shorter pieces by many others.

In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

ENGL W3002,"HUMANITIES TEXTS, CRIT SKILLS","This course aims to equip students with critical tools for approaching, reading, and striving with literary and philosophical texts—ancient as well as modern. To this end, we will be working closely with a set of texts that range in date from the 8th/7th c. BCE to the 20th century C, including: Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Du Bois, Nabokov and Rankine. Our seminar will operate on the assumption that we cannot know “what” these texts say or “what” their authors mean unless we come to grips with how they say what they say and how they mean what they mean. In pursuit of some answers, we will master the skill of reading quickly but carefully, balancing attention to the literary craft of our texts with scrutiny of their underlying arguments and agendas.

FILM S2295,WORLD CINEMA: MEXICO,"The global success of film directors Alejandro González Iñárritu, Alfonso Cuarón, and Guillermo del Toro has attracted much attention to the New Mexican Cinema. Yet this «Nuevo cine mexicano» cannot be understood without knowing the traditions of Mexico’s intricate film history. This course explores the numerous tendencies of Mexican cinema through the analysis of its most representative genres, features, and directors since the so called Golden Age (1938-1957). An in-depth analysis of films such as Emilio Fernández’s María Candelaria (1943), Luis Buñuel’s Los olvidados (1950), Jomi García Ascot’s On the Empty Balcony (1962), Alejandro Jodorowsky’s The Mole (1970), and Arturo Ripstein's Deep Crimson (1996) will contribute to define the characteristics of the most relevant «national» genres – from 1940s melodramas to 1970s acid Westerns and 1990s crime films. The study of the New Mexican Cinema of Iñárritu (Amores perros, 2000), Cuarón (Y tu mamá también, 2001), and del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, 2006) will also comprise an examination of the complex relationship between the US and Mexican film industries, as well as a critique of the very notion of «national identity» in today’s globalized world. We will also analyze new tendencies in commercial, experimental, and documentary Mexican films – including Carlos Reygadas' Silent Light (2007) and Pedro González Rubio's Alamar (2009).

While using a short film script as their own case study – students will learn pitching, development, script breakdown, scheduling, budgeting and fundraising. Discussion of legal issues, location scouting, deliverables, marketing, distribution and film festival strategy will allow students to move forward with their own projects after completing the class. Using weekly assignments, in-class presentations and textbook readings to reinforce each class discussion topic, students will complete the class having created a final prep/production binder for their project, which includes the script breakdown, production schedule, line item budget, financing/fundraising plan and film festival strategy for their chosen script.",Jamund E Washington,1:00pm,4:10pm,14691,Morningside,S3833-20172-001,,Film,FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623181017/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/S3833-20172-001/,507 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

FILM S4138,AUTEUR STUDY,"Steven Spielberg may be the world’s most influential living film director. His uncanny grasp of visual storytelling and his auteurist signature can be found on every film he has directed, as well as many he has produced. This course will analyze the content and formal construction of Spielberg’s films by following their thematic through-lines – family ties (strained and healthy), the implacable threat, humanity at war, man vs. the natural world, the child’s perspective, and others – in films as disparate as

COURSE DESCRIPTION
 
 This 8-week summer course is designed for non-native speakers who have completed a minimum of one year (two semesters) of French at the beginner’s level. The objective of this class is to provide a pedagogical structure for students to take full advantage of their immersion experience in Paris. The course will be comprised of a mix of classroom and excursion time, with 30 hours of in-class activities especially dedicated to hone students’ aural and oral skills, and 12 hours of targeted, small-group explorations in the city. The theme of this summer’s class is “Mapping hidden Paris through urban diversity” (“Promenades secrètes à travers la diversité parisienne”).” During these eight weeks, we will focus on the hidden, quirky, unusual sides of Paris, structured around different and varied groups of people who have inhabited Paris and left their mark: artists, immigrants, workers, students, aristocrats, laborers, etc. The excursions will take the students to out of the ordinary places hidden within Paris: village streets, mansions, contemporary ephemeral street art, underground urban networks, flea markets, and so on. Students will spend time in the classroom and at home preparing for their excursions by studying documentaries, short movies, songs, poems, pamphlets, drawings, and paintings. Students will work towards a final presentation at the end of the eight weeks, “Mon Paris,” centered on the relationship between identity and Paris as an urban text.",Karen Santos da Silva,1:00pm,3:00pm,88529,Morningside,OC2223-20172-001,INTERMEDIATE FRENCH CULTURE&CO;,French and Romance Philology,FREN,http://culpa.info/professors/12614,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623184103/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/OC2223-20172-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

Working on the advanced grammar points covered in this course will further strengthen their mastery of French syntax.

FREN OC3827,MOSAIC PARIS,"Prerequisites: 2 years of College French 
 This course is an introduction to the history, the sociology, and the anthropology of various communities in Paris. Focusing on different communities will lead us to reconsider the history of Paris, of France, of Europe, and of the colonial and post-colonial world, and will help explain the presence of the many immigrants (and of their children who have become French citizens) who have come from other parts of Europe, but also from the Caribbean, the Maghreb, sub-Saharan Africa, as well as from Asia. Through this lens, we will link the past to the present and gain perspective on contemporary debates—including multiculturalism, immigration (regulated and clandestine), the question of secularism, the place of Islam, etc.—facing French society that arise precisely because of Paris’ status as a “global city.” 
 The course will first consider the settlement of immigrant European, Caribbean, African and Asian (Belgian, Italian, Spaniard, Polish, Portuguese, Caribbean, Algerian, Senegalese, Vietnamese…) or migrant (French of North African descent before 1962, for example) communities in the singular space constituted by Paris. Secondly, we will problematize (by linking the question to this long history of (im)migration to Paris) the idea that a certain type of ethnic and/or confessional sectarianism (which the course will attempt to define) is in the process of taking hold in France—and in its capital—at the expense of a rich diversity that has, for a long time, made Paris a large cosmopolitan and multicultural city.  
 In this course students will learn to work on the entire gamut of primary sources from the most traditional (e.g. essays, political statements, press reviews, administrative reports, demographic statistics, judicial archives, etc.) to less commonly used sources such as iconographic materials (e.g. paintings, photography, postcards, films) as well as private diaries, correspondence, etc. These primary sources will be studied in each session and will be contextualized in relation to secondary sources.",Caitlin D Deighan,10:00am,1:00pm,17066,Morningside,OC3827-20172-001,,French and Romance Philology,FREN,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623184108/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/OC3827-20172-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

On the one hand, the seminar will read introductory and representative texts on the history of crime, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Among the themes to be discussed are: the impact of urbanization and cultural change on historical patterns of crime; the role of transgression and punishment in the construction of collective identities; the everyday relationship of urban populations with the law, the police, and the judiciary, and the gendered meanings of violence. On the other hand, the seminar will work with cultural representations of crime.

HIST S4779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current 'memory wars' in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.",Gregory Mann,1:00pm,4:10pm,69200,Morningside,S4779-20172-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/931,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623193233/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S4779-20172-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

The increasing accessibility of analytic tools for researching and visualizing changing patterns of human rights abuse has empowered groups to better understand and respond more forcefully to these issues. Indeed, the use of social media as a communications tool has made it a data source for those monitoring and analyzing patterns of activity, in ways that draw increasingly on the techniques of big data analysis.",Ted Perlmutter,5:30pm,8:30pm,60896,Morningside,S4270-20172-001,SOCIAL MEDIA & HUMAN RIGHTS,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623194114/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4270-20172-001/,402 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

HRTS S4407,"WOMEN, GENDER & POLIT VIOLENCE","This course explores how women's experiences of violence in conflict are guided by traditional patriarchal views of femininity, and furthermore how this violence influences their agencies and their realization of human rights. Through academic texts, documents produced by the U.N. and NGOs globally, academic experts, and documentaries, we will explore a wide range of women's experiences of violence in conflict, including: the relationship between domestic violence in the private/home space and the violence of war in the public space; how the rape of women is used to decipher and forge the borders/boundaries of imagined, emerging nations, as in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda; debates on women terrorists, suicide bombers, and freedom fighters; and sexual violence against women in the U.S. military.",Julie Rajan,1:00pm,4:10pm,11279,Morningside,S4407-20172-001,"WOMEN, GENDER & POLIT VIO",Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623194118/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4407-20172-001/,401 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various counterterrorism strategies, from the point of view of efficacy as well as ethics, and look into ways in which the new threat of global terrorism might impact the healthy functioning of democratic states.",Stuart M Gottlieb,2:00pm,5:10pm,22558,Morningside,S6387-20172-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,http://localhost:8801/professors/2219,silver,12.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623204146/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6387-20172-001/,407 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

INAF S6554,UN & THE CHAL OF PEACE,"It is now a well known fact that countries embroiled in conflict seldom emerge from it ""once and for all."" They tend to relapse back into conflict within months or years. The reasons are also well-known: low education and high poverty levels, weak or non- existent institutions, poor governance, exclusion and marginalization of certain groups including women and poor economic prospects certainly in livelihoods. And yet Peace building in the international context is a relatively new concept. It appeared in the in the UN lexicon in the 1980s and has evolved as a normative concept since. Peace building is complex and multi-faceted encompassing security, human rights, development and reconciliation of past differences and ultimately societal transformation. It is before everything else a political exercise. This course will ask: How is Peace building done, who are the actors and stakeholders? What lessons have we learnt since the 1980s? What does it take to build the peace? The course will give an understanding of the evolution of the norm of peace building at the United Nations and discuss the new UN Peace building architecture. Ten years after its creation, has the Peace Building Commission made a difference and why? What have been its challenges? It will look at the many stakeholders on the ground and discuss the issue of coordination and the need for integrated strategies. It will provide examples of countries that have succeeded, analyze the root causes of the conflicts and the tools which were used. It will extract the lessons learned and the conditions for peace building to succeed.",James William Rawley,2:00pm,5:10pm,16030,Morningside,S6554-20172-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623204150/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6554-20172-001/,402B International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"This past year marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations (UN) and the year when a new Secretary-General will be selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki Moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to -­â€ fewer but deadlier -­armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate -­armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention?

LAW_ S3150,COMPARATIVE JURISPRUDENCE,"Jurisprudence, at its core, is the study of legal theory. Fundamentally, however, what is ""law?"" By studying alternative constitutional systems, what can we learn about the legal foundations of various governments and societies? What influence has legal theory had on the development of very different government structures, and how do different governments grapple with constitutional controversy? This course is designed to explore the basic foundational principles that make up the study of legal theory. It begins by studying the core schools of thought, including natural law, legal positivism, and legal realism. The course then uses these basic concepts to explore and understand the greater development of fundamental, constitutional law and theory within different legal systems in different countries. By comparing various constitution and government structures, using basic legal philosophy as a guide, students will gain a valuable base understanding of the development and execution of legal thought within different societies.",Christopher R Riano,6:15pm,9:25pm,18545,Morningside,S3150-20172-001,,School of Professional Studies,LAW_,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170623214047/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LAW_/S3150-20172-001/,411 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

Can a college censor a student newspaper? If a student is disciplined on campus, do they have a right to an attorney? Do students have a property interest in their education that can cost over $100,000? How does the law treat private and public institutions differently?

Throughout the history of the American republic, various actors have sought to shape electoral outcomes. Some have even done so legally! While contemporary citizens of the United States have tended to think of their elections as paragons of reliability, events in the last fifteen years or so have increasingly led to questions on this front. This course will examine issues of fairness, integrity, and security currently facing the American electoral system. In identifying ailments in American democracy, we will discuss both their causes and effects. Finally, we will examine potential reforms in an effort to determine to what extent American elections can be “fixed” (see what I did there?).

Rapid economic growth and associated domestic institutional changes in rising great powers often unleash a volatile domestic politics that affects the ideologies and social interests that play a role in formulating foreign policy.

The course approaches the study of contemporary diplomacy by combining international relations theory and empirical cases to analyze the influence of diplomacy, as an instrument of statecraft, including its methods, practices and strategies, on how states interact and pursue their goals. The purposes of this course are to examine how states manage and shape external relations through diplomacy, either alone or in combination with other instruments as well as to analyze the conditions under which diplomatic statecraft has had positive, negative or no impact on various foreign policies and international outcomes. 
 While this is not a course about American diplomacy, the United States will often be discussed given its continued and unique significance to post-Cold War diplomatic statecraft. We critically assess and analyze the practice of diplomacy amid a range of post-Cold War cases and developments including the reunification of Germany, Israeli-Palestinian relations since the Oslo Accords, coercive diplomacy against Iraq, Haiti, and Iran, the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement, the Dayton Accords, the fight against terrorism, an evolving international environmental agenda, and technological changes in the digital domain.",Rebecca S Murphy,6:15pm,9:25pm,69254,Morningside,S3961-20172-001,CONTEMPORARY DIPLOMACY,Political Science,POLS,http://localhost:8801/professors/12030,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624031222/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/S3961-20172-001/,711 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

PSYC S3664,PSYCHOLOGY OF EMOTION,"Prerequisites: Instructor permission required, contact  js3526@columbia.edu 
 This course will provide an overview of theoretical perspectives and research on what emotions are, what functions they serve, and what roles emotions and emotion regulation play in many parts of our lives such asmental health, social relationships, and decision making. The readings will incorporate a wide array of tools that scientists have adopted to understand emotions at different levels of analysis, such as the use of physiological measures (including brain activity), behavioral measures, self-reports of experience, and data acquired through social media.To present different perspectives on the study of emotions, the course will cover research drawn from such fields as social psychology, clinical psychology and developmental psychology, as well as social and affective neuroscience. Concurrently, we will hone a scientific mindset by approaching readings, presentations,and writing assignments with a structured approach to scientific inquiry that helps us identify the major components of the research process when reading and thinking about scientific research.",Jocelyn Shu,5:30pm,8:40pm,77642,Morningside,S3664-20172-001,,Psychology,PSYC,http://culpa.info/professors/12656,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624034736/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PSYC/S3664-20172-001/,405 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for ""modernization"" and/or ""reform"" feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal/religious reform (e.g., Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g., Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g., evolution, bioethics ). The class ends by examining the efforts of American and European Muslim communities to carve out distinct spheres of identity in the larger global Muslim community ( umma) through expressions of popular culture (e.g. Hip-Hop).",Najam I Haider,1:00pm,4:10pm,18046,Morningside,S2305-20172-001,Islam,Religion,RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/10466,gold,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624041754/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/S2305-20172-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,,"Barnard

While there are no required prerequisites for the course, prior coursework in religious studies or African American history is helpful. This course progresses as a historical survey and is intended to introduce students to important themes in African American (thus American) religious history (i.e. migration, urbanization, nationalism) through a rich engagement with the religious practices and traditions of black communities. Primary attention is given to Afro-Protestantism in North America; however, throughout the course attention is directed to religious diversity and varying religious traditions/practices in different diasporic locales. While this is a lecture course, students are expected to arrive each week having completed assigned readings and prepared to make informed contributions to class discussions (as class size allows). By the end of the semester students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of major themes/figures/traditions in African American religious life, as well as key questions that have shaped the study thereof.",Josef Sorett,1:00pm,4:10pm,14516,Morningside,S2335-20172-001,,Religion,RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/9341,silver,3.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Sorett,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624041757/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/S2335-20172-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,,"Barnard

THEA S4215,THE NEW YORK THEATRE EVENT,"In this course students explore the elements involved in the creation of theatre today in the historic heart of American theatre: New York City. The core elements of theatrical craft are discussed: playwriting, directing, acting, design and producing. Aspects of New York theatrical history complement these discussions by exploring the roots and traditions of theatrical practice. While a variety of theatrical forms and styles are explored, this course is rooted in contemporary dramatic texts. Each week students attend a live performance at various venues throughout the city in order to gain insight into the ways that theatre truly becomes a New York event.",Christopher G Burney,7:00pm,10:00pm,71114,Morningside,S4215-20172-001,,Theatre Arts,THEA,http://localhost:8801/professors/3138,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624074817/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/THEA/S4215-20172-001/,603 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts.

WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer?  What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia?   In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed.   From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing.

However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of ""new adult"" or ""crossover"" fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",Rachel E Carter,10:00am,12:00pm,64283,Morningside,S4323-20172-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624083926/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20172-001/,411 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4411,CREATIVE (MIS)TRANSLATION,"No foreign language required.Translation is at once a process, a procedure, and a metaphor. The practice of translation brings out our hidden prejudices, our ingrained biases; notions of the literary text that we take for granted come to the foreground and call on us to make crucial choices, aesthetic and political. In this short course, we'll see how the problems of translation ""translate"" over to the writing of fiction and poetry. By recuperating volition and agency in the encounter with the authority(ies) present in any given text, the writer finds openings in and through translation. We'll explore the generative aspects of translation and ""misĀ­ translation"": how translating might open up new reserves oflanguage for us to mine; how it might loosen our grip on our own ""voice"" and let in others; and conversely, how our own language might affect our encounter with a foreign or faraway voice.",Matvei E Yankelevich,5:30pm,7:40pm,71513,Morningside,S4411-20172-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624083927/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4411-20172-001/,407 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4710,MORE THAN MEMOIR,"Many of us want to write memoirs, but families-troubled or not-are loaded territory. Memories conflict with family lore; trauma in the past can trigger trouble in the present; and only the dead don't mind when you spill their secrets. How do we navigate wisely, mining recollections without either slipping into solipsism or pandering to an imagined audience? In this class we'll look at writers who have done it, such as James Baldwin, Annie Dillard, Vivian Gornick, Richard Rodriguez, and Sister Souljah, to trace their fault lines and unearth their strategies for remaining faithful to their readers while truthful to their lived experience. This is a writing-intensive course, and students will write and workshop several family scenes. With the student work in hand, we'll be able to explore issues of voice and point of view, and ways to gain enough emotional distance from characters to make them both believable and three-dimensional. We'll build these scenes into a few full-length stories or, if a student wishes, chapters for a larger work.",Cristen A Beam,6:15pm,8:25pm,73195,Morningside,S4710-20172-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624083928/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4710-20172-001/,409 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,5:30pm,7:40pm,63067,Morningside,S4810-20172-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20170624083929/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4810-20172-001/,411 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard
