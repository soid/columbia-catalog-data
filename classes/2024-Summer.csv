ACCT B7007,Financial Planning & Analysis,"This course explores the use of financial information for internal planning, analysis, and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.
 Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
 The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal-reporting mistakes.
 To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.
 
 We will examine the following key topics:
 ? Designing managerial information systems to support an organization’s strategy.
 ? Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.
 ? Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.
 ? The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.
 ? The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.
 ? Activity-based costing and activity-based management.
 ? Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.
 ? Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.
 ? The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.
 ? The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",Igor Vaysman,,,11913,,B7007-20242-001,Financial Planning & Anal,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7007-20242-001/,,In-Person,,1.5,,,20242ACCT7007B001,LECTURE
ACCT B7009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?
The course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models – models that use
financial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements – but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models – but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that
you have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.
By the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private
equity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",Radha Radhakrishna,,,11926,,B7009-20242-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7009-20242-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20242ACCT7009B001,LECTURE

ACCT B8009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"This course will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing financial statements. Students will learn about the general tools, theoretical concepts, and practical valuation issues of financial analysis. By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.
Course content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm’s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:
1. Understand the firm’s strategy. We will assess the firm’s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.
2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.
3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.
4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.
5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm’s current value. 
In the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",Thomas E Bourveau,9:00am,5:00pm,11813,,B8009-20242-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8009-20242-001/,390 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,,3,,MTWRF,20242ACCT8009B001,LECTURE

AHIS BC2013,Drawing in the City,"Course Description:
  
This course will provide an opportunity to experience New York City through drawing. It will focus on drawing as a way of experiencing and viewing the world and as a way of expressing concepts. The class takes place both in the studio and in the city itself, including in cultural institutions, parks, cafes and the street. In sketchbooks and journals, students will document and elaborate upon their encounters with the city. The class will incorporate different themes, including: history, community, intimacy, exchange, structure, motion, architecture, nature. We will learn about different drawing techniques and uses of drawing. Exercises will at times intersect with quotidian urban activities. We will, for example, document a walk through the park or sit in a cafe working out visual ideas. Students will fill their sketchbook with drawn records of their experience of the city and will learn about the history of depicting the city through the eyes of different artists such as Edward Hopper, Martin Wong, Faith Ringold, Alice Neel, Florine Stettheimer and Mina Loy.

AHIS S2314,MASTERS OF THE BAROQUE,"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art—Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Velázquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)—artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context.

Alongside Gothic Revival churches, skyscrapers, campuses, and parks, this course will consider other forms of medieval architectural revivalism (including Moorish Revival synagogues and Romanesque Revival rowhouses) as well as projects that physically relocated medieval buildings to New York City both for private collections and public display.

Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts.

 created the conditions we call climate change. With this we will take a particular interest in the question of how
 race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, and gender articulate with the material effects of climate change. The course
 also focuses on how we, as scholars, citizens, and activists can work to alter these current conditions in ways
 that foster social and ecological justice for all living beings. Although we will ground our scholarship in
 anthropology, to encourage interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary thought, weekly readings will be drawn
 from across scholarly and activist canons. While becoming familiar with scholarly and activist conversations
 about space and place, risk and vulnerability, and ontology and epistemology, we will work through a series of
 recent events as case studies to understand causes, effects, affects, and potential solutions.",Fern M Thompsett,5:30pm,8:40pm,10008,,S2724-20242-001,ANTHROPOLOGY OF CLIMATE C,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/S2724-20242-001/,214 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242ANTH2724S001,LECTURE

The perspective will be primarily anthropological, although special attention will be paid to historical processes associated with colonialism and nation-building that are crucial to understanding present gender politics. We will focus on the sexual politics of everyday life in specific locales and explore the extent to which these are shaped by these histories and the power of representations mobilized in a global world in the present and international political interventions. In addition to reading ethnographic works about particular communities, we read memoirs and critical analyses of the local and transnational activist movements that have emerged to address various aspects of gender politics and rights.",Maria F Malmstrom,1:00pm,4:10pm,11646,,V3465-20242-001,"WOMEN, GENDER POL-MUSLIM",Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3465-20242-001/,313 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242ANTH3465V001,LECTURE

But we will also look into forms of dissipation and/or enhancement of personhood through bodybuilding, guinea-piging and pharmo-toxicities.

APAN PS5450,CLOUD COMPUTING,"Data analytics have become an essential component of business intelligence and informed decision making. Sophisticated statistical and algorithmic methodologies, generally known as data science, are now of predominant interest and focus. Yet, the underlying cloud computing platform is fundamental to the enablement of data management and analytics.
 
 This course introduces students to cloud computing concepts and practices ranging from infrastructure and administration to services and applications. The course is primarily focused on the development of practical skills in utilizing cloud services to build distributed and scalable analytics applications. Students will have hands-on exposure to VMs (Virtual Machines), databases, storage, microservices, and AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) services through Google Cloud Platform, et al.  Cost and performance characteristics of alternative approaches will also be studied. Topics include: overview of cloud computing, cloud systems, parallel processing in the cloud, distributed storage systems, virtualization, security in the cloud, and multicore operating systems. Throughout, students will study state-of-the-art solutions for cloud computing developed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.
 
 The course modules provide a blend of lecture and reading materials along with class exercises and programming assignments. While extensive programming experience is not required, students taking the course are expected to possess basic Python 3 programming skills.
 
 The desired outcome of the course is the student’s ability to put conceptual knowledge to practical use. Whether you are taking this course for future academic research, for work in industry, or for an innovative startup idea, this course should help you master the fundamentals of cloud computing.",Javid B Huseynov,8:10pm,10:00pm,11571,,K5450-20242-D01,,Applied Analytics,APAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/APAN/K5450-20242-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,W,20242APAN5450KD01,LECTURE

architectural analysis and design experimentation.
  
Introducing design methodologies that allow us to perceive and reshape spatial and material interactions in new
  
ways, the studio will focus on how architecture negotiates, alters or redirects multiple forces in our world:
  
physical, cultural, social, technological, political etc. The semester progresses through two projects that examine
  
unique atmospheric, spatial and urban conditions with the aid of multimedia visual techniques; and that employ
  
design to develop critical and creative interventions at different scales. Learning analog and digital drawing
  
techniques, physical model-making, and multimedia image production, students will work in the studio and
  
digital architecture lab. The course includes site visits and field trips in the city.

ARTP BC0002,Global Modernism,"The aim of this course is to explore the history and discourses of modern art, modernism, and the
 avant-garde via the social and theoretical questions understood to have driven the development
 of artistic modernism around the globe from roughly 1789 to 1968. The course will be organized
 according to four major lenses of inquiry: “Aesthetic Categories within Social Art Histories,”
 “Formalism and Autonomy,” “Perception and Artistic Production,” and “the Role of the Mind,
 or, the Beholder’s Share.” Each of these lenses, or themes, will be driven by a set of readings,
 images, and key terms that together constitute “conversations,” or orientations toward the history
 of modern art. An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into
 focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader
 discourse. However, because there is a fair amount of conceptual overlap among the course’s
 themes, the foremost goal is to enable critical analysis of modern, visual artworks from multiple
 perspectives, or within multiple frameworks. In considering the many, dynamic engagements of
 theory, history, and visual artworks, this course will provide not only a strong knowledge of
 modern art, modernism, and the avant-garde, it will also help students develop a sense of the

BIET K5315,Special Topics in Philosophical Bioethic,"This course is designed to afford students significant opportunity to explore fundamental bioethical issues in a philosophically searching way. For example, it is generally thought that health matters. But then what is health? And how does it matter? What is justice in respect to health-care and the other social determinants of health? Do competing theories of justice (e.g., liberal, libertarian, utilitarian) offer incompatible solutions to the question of healthcare justice? Or can a workable “overlapping consensus” at the public policy level nevertheless be achieved?
  
Should a healthcare professional be permitted, on grounds of conscience, to refuse to provide a healthcare service to which people are lawfully permitted? Indeed, what should count as “conscience”? In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, some have argued for a right to conscientiously insist on providing reproductive services that have been legally prohibited. How are we to sort through and resolve this complicated set of issues?
  
Could a meaningful personal understanding of what it means for someone to have died nevertheless not be suitable as the basis for a legal declaration of death? Why not? Should there be a “conscience clause” option whereby someone can specify in advance the conception of death to be applied in that individual’s own case? Would every possible criterion be available or would certain criteria have to be excluded? Which? Why?
  
The population in this and many other societies is aging and putting increasingly significant demands on the healthcare delivery system. Should healthcare be rationed according to age?  Would it be unfair to young people not to give weight to that factor—lest they lose out on a fair chance to live as long as society’s seniors already have? What is healthcare justice across the generations?
  
As researchers gain a fuller understanding of the aging process, it may soon be possible to genetically engineer a significant extension (even doubling?) of human life-span. Is this an appropriate objective for healthcare science to be pursuing?  Is the point of healthcare to extend human life as far as possible by whatever means? Is aging a kind of “disease” in its own right? Would life so dramatically extended be beneficial or burdensome?
  
The topics for this course have been selected in view of (i) how fundamental they are to bioethical thinking (e.g., What is health?",Arthur Kuflik,4:00pm,6:00pm,11653,,K5315-20242-D01,Advanced Philosophical BI,Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5315-20242-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20242BIET5315KD01,LECTURE
BIET K5435,"ST Leadership, Ethics & Drug Development","Special Topics in Leadership, Ethics and Drug Development
  
In Ethical leadership decisions regarding drug development, regulation and delivery is a multi-dimensional process with varied stakeholders, each having their own objectives.  This course will provide students with a look at how leaders in health care faced with real-life decisions utilized ethics to determine an outcome. The course is designed as a one week intensive in-person course, with two guest lecturers per day from industry, government, funding organizations, HCPs and patient organizations to help students gain a greater understanding of all stakeholders involved in health care decision making. 
  
Through posted and classroom discussion, speakers will address and students will be challenged to consider the following questions:
  
  
Who are the relevant stakeholders?  What are their preferences and do they conflict?  If so, how is this conflict best resolved?
  
How do we apply a bioethical framework – the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice -- to this problem?
  
When understanding how a new medicine is developed, how are the long and short term risks, large and small, weighed and evaluated against potential benefits?
  
Does industry consider justice– such as access and affordability – when deciding what products to develop?
  
What would you advise if you were an ethics consultant?
  
What do you think about the actions taken to address the issue?
  
How are ethical questions handled within organizations?  Are consultants used formally or informally to ensure outside perspectives?

BIET PS5360,CHALLENGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL BIOETHICS,"The environment affects human health and well-being, and current health-care technology can impact the environment. Thus, questions about how humans ought to relate both to their own environment and to other living beings on this planet fall squarely within the field of bioethics. While some observers may see bioethics as concerning only the health of human beings defined narrowly, bioethics in fact has many implications for the larger biosphere and vice versa. 
  
This course discusses important issues at the nexus of bioethics and the environment, including climate change, ozone shield depletion, soil erosion, ocean pollution, diminishing biodiversity-all among the environmental factors with adverse consequences for the health of both human and non-human beings. Even the technologies employed in health-
care 
have environmental impact harmful 
to 
health.

Topics covered include: general principles of study design; probability, hypothesis testing; review of methods for comparison of discrete and continuous data including ANOVA, t-test, correlation, and regression.  This course is part of the core course requirement for the MPH and is a prerequisite for other courses in the Department of Biostatistics and throughout the Mailman School of Public Health.",Christine M Mauro,,,13792,,P6103-20242-001,INTRODUCTION TO BIOSTATIS,Biostatistics,BIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIST/P6103-20242-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20242BIST6103P001,LECTURE
BIST P6104,Introduction to Biostatistical Methods,"Like many fields of learning, biostatistics has its own vocabulary often seen in medical and public health literature. Phrases like statistical significance"", ""p-value less than 0.05"", ""95% confident"", and ""margin of error"" can have enormous impact in a world that relies on statistics to make decisions: Should Drug A be recommended over Drug B? Should a national policy on X be implemented? Does Vitamin C truly prevent colds? However, do we really know what these terms and phrases mean? Understanding the theory and methodology behind study design, estimation and hypothesis testing is crucial to ensuring that findings and practices in public health and biomedicine are supported by reliable evidence.",,,,12686,,P6104-20242-001,INTRO-BIOSTATISTICAL METH,Biostatistics,BIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIST/P6104-20242-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20242BIST6104P001,LECTURE

This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters.

BUSI B8704,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundat","These days it is rare to find a business or organization that does not list Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) as a top priority. Business leaders are expected to lead diverse teams and support DEI, yet little formal education is provided to leaders in the field on the subject. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundations addresses this gap by introducing the fundamental concepts, frameworks, and theories that inform how we as leaders make meaning of diversity, equity, and inclusion personally and professionally. This course is an excellent opportunity for those interested in developing their ability to; understand and engage in conversations about diversity and inclusion; develop the ability to speak to the role DEI will play in their professional career; explore how their own identities relate to various systems of power, inclusion, and exclusion and contribute to building a more equitable workplace.

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

CLEN S3682,Human Rights in World Literature and Vis,"This course explores contemporary human rights issues in fiction, nonfiction, and film from Africa, Latin America, South Asia, the Caribbean, and the U.S., as well as humanitarian-inspired art, documentaries, television, and music circulated around the world. When decolonial and indigenous writers and cultural workers decide to represent violence in their countries, they risk reproducing racist stereotypes that permeate international media. And yet, human rights violations tied to war, slavery, sexual violence, religious fundamentalism, and ethnic strife are central features of turbulent national histories—including our own in America. How can twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers from the Global South and beyond undermine the harmful stereotypes and dominant narratives that predetermine their stories in the international public sphere without reproducing stereotypes? To better understand strife abroad, we will take an interdisciplinary feminist approach to the politics of representing human rights. Our readings, paired with options for extracurricular events like film screenings in New York City, will prompt us to reflect critically on the ambivalences surrounding human rights in global culture. We will engage literary representations of historical events ranging from the Holocaust to the Vietnam War and the Rwandan genocide, all the way up to extremism in our present moment. Final projects invite students to reflect on methods for representing human rights through creative writing. This course, which fulfills the University Global Core requirement, as well as English major requirements for prose fiction/narrative and comparative/global literature, will appeal to students of not only literature but also in human rights, history, political science, African studies, law, and gender and sexuality studies.",Nicole M Gervasio,1:00pm,4:10pm,10345,,S3682-20242-001,Human Rights in World Lit,Summer Session (SUMM),CLEN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLEN/S3682-20242-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242CLEN3682S001,SEMINAR

CLMT G5016,An Introduction to Complex Climate Risks,"Extreme climate and weather events can lead to cascading failures that can spread within and across socio-environmental systems and sectors, often disproportionally affecting underserved communities. Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent, synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies, from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.
 
 This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world eventsin which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year long with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold-spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighbourhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.

CLMT GR5018,Building Equitable Community Partnership,"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional
 effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a “whole of community” approach to disaster management.
 
 The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:
  
  
Describe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience
  
Describe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle
  
Identify whole community approaches for disaster management
  
Identify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management
  
Demonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",,5:30pm,7:15pm,12039,,G5018-20242-001,Building Partnerships in,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5018-20242-001/,311 Fayerweather,Hybrid 20-79,,1.5,,TR,20242CLMT5018G001,SEMINAR
CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.
 
 All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages
 is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to
 consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request. This course will be of interest to those
 majoring in Slavic and/or Jewish Studies, as well as anyone interested in Comparative Literature, History, Art

DMVP BC1001,Functional Anatomy for Movement,"This is an introduction to the study of Countertechnique® taught by certified Teacher, Francesca Dominguez. Countertechnique® is a system of movement designed for dancers to practice self-direction and to cultivate availability to movement while learning to take risks. Developed over the past 25 years by Dutch choreographer, Anouk Van Dijk, the technique utilizes a task-based approach for body and mind as the vehicle to approach dance. It is a movement system that helps the dancer think with the dancing body by focusing on the process of incorporating anatomical information into action; and beginning to direct and counter-direct the body through space as an alternative to gripping or falling over. Dancers are encouraged to be proactive in discovering connections and solutions, to be less concerned with judging themselves, and to work in a healthy way physically, mentally, and emotionally. The priority is to experience clarity and enjoyment of movement while utilizing the Countertechnique® principles. ☺ www.countertechnique.com By the end of the semester, students will have a clarified relationship to space; a developed coordination and articulation of the body; they will gain knowledge about the anatomy of the body especially joint structure, location, and range; and will be able to begin Scanning – the ability to observe one’s own state-of-being and draw upon solutions according to need and/or experimentation.",Francesca Dominguez,2:00pm,4:30pm,00113,,X1001-20242-001,Functional Anatomy Moveme,Pre-College Program (Barnard),DMVP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DMVP/X1001-20242-001/,To be announced,,,0,,W,20242DMVP1001X001,LECTURE

DROM B7114,Applied Regression Analysis,"This course is designed for students who wish to increase their capability to build, use, and interpret statistical models for business.
A primary goal of the course is to enable students to build and evaluate statistical models for managerial use in finance, operations and marketing. The focus is on generating managerially useful information and practical decision-making tools, rather than on statistical theory per se. A number of actual business cases are studied.
Concepts covered are multiple linear regression models and the computer-assisted methods for building them, including stepwise regression and all subsets regression. Emphasis is placed on diagnostic and graphical methods for testing the validity and reliability of regression models.
Course topics include a review of basic statistical ideas, numerical and graphical methods for summarizing data, simple linear and nonlinear regression, multiple regression, qualitative independent and dependent variables, diagnostic methods for assessing the validity of statistical models. The course studies applications of regression to business forecasting and also examines alternative times series forecasting models, including exponential smoothing.
While the primary focus of the course is on regression models, some other statistical models will be studied as well, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and goodness-of-fit tests.
Term project: A major aspect of course is the opportunity to carry out a practical statistical analysis project of one’s own. Students work in teams on a problem of their own choosing. The goal of the project is to develop a useful statistical model for a specific business problem, with the professor providing ongoing guidance and advice during the course of project. The teams will give an oral presentation of their results at the term’s end. 
Excel is used for basic statistical analysis as well as for developing straightforward regression models. In addition, more advanced commercial statistical software, such as Minitab or SAS, is used to carry out more complex and advanced analyses. In addition to the term project, there will be several computer-based assignments.",David Juran,,,11930,,B7114-20242-002,Applied Regression Analys,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B7114-20242-002/,,In-Person,,1.5,,,20242DROM7114B002,LECTURE

DROM B8106,Operations Strategy,"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,"" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, ""Firm Boundaries,"" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, ""Internal Operations,"" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, ""New Challenges,"" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.""",Medini Singh,9:00am,5:00pm,11830,,B8106-20242-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8106-20242-001/,440 Kravis Hall,In-Person,,3,,MTWRF,20242DROM8106B001,LECTURE
DROM B8109,Supply Chain Management,"Supply chain management entails managing the flow of goods and information through a production or distribution network to ensure that the right goods are delivered to the right place in the right quantity at the right time. Two primary objectives are to gain competitive edge via superior customer service and to reduce costs through efficient procurement, production and delivery systems. Supply chain management encompasses a wide range of activities — from strategic activities, such as capacity expansion or consolidation, make/buy decisions and initiation of supplier contracts, to tactical activities, such as production, procurement and logistics planning, to, finally, operational activities, such as operations scheduling and release decisions, batch sizing and issuing of purchase orders.",Will Ma,9:00am,5:00pm,11818,,B8109-20242-001,Revenue and Supply Chain,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8109-20242-001/,420 Kravis Hall,,,3,,MTWRU,20242DROM8109B001,LECTURE
DROM B8131,Sports Analytics,"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. 
Students are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the ""laboratory"" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",Mark N Broadie,9:00am,5:00pm,11812,,B8131-20242-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8131-20242-001/,390 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,,3,,MTWRF,20242DROM8131B001,LECTURE

ECON BC3081,Economics of Work and Play,"In 1930 Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by the 21st century because he expected we would be at the foothills of the ""economic promised land."" He was more than right about technological progress and staggering productivity growth –– but dead wrong about the role work would play in our lives. Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions. 
  
 
  
This course is centered on the concept of ""work."" The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing. 
  
 
  
We begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge –– for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes ""work activity"" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of ""man"" and ""work.”
  
 
  
The course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market “facts” that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close ""exegesis"" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.",Lalith Munasinghe,1:00pm,4:10pm,00023,,X3081-20242-001,Economics of Work and Pla,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/X3081-20242-001/,912 MILSTEIN CEN,,,3,,MW,20242ECON3081X001,LECTURE

We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a “hot-house world”, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future.

On the other, her husband’s virginal, naive, and beautiful daughter – whose own mother is usually dead. The conflict between them is so familiar that it feels inevitable. Where, though, did these nearly universal figures come from? Why are they so ingrained in the imaginations of people around the world and across the millennia? In this course, we’ll explore the roots of the maternal in folk and fairy tales. We’ll analyze a variety of stories and films to investigate the “absent mother,” “virginal daughter,” and “wicked stepmother” from different critical perspectives, paying special attention to analytical psychology and feminist psychoanalytic theories, to try to figure out why these figures are so compelling, so ubiquitous, and so hard to shake.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,00035,,X1903-20242-001,DEAD MOTHER-WICKED STEPMO,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1903-20242-001/,403 Barnard Hall,,,3,,TR,20242ENGL1903X001,SEMINAR

 gender, sexuality, morality, fear, and authority, among other things. For millennia, female spirituality
 and female sexuality have been paired in ways that reveal deep-seated anxieties about the female
 body and its power. From ancient Mesopotamian goddess worship to the frenzied witch hunts of
 early modern Europe to the child-devouring crones of folk tales from cultures around the world,
 we’ll delve into what the witch and those who name and pursue her reveal about deeply-held cultural
 beliefs, desires, and anxieties. We’ll work together to analyze the figure of the witch across time and

ENGL BC3304,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, George Orwell, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Alexandra P Watson,1:00pm,4:10pm,00037,,X3304-20242-001,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3304-20242-001/,119 MILSTEIN CEN,,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3304X001,WORKSHOP

ENGL S3233,SHAKESPEARE,"This course provides an introduction to Shakespeare through a combination of reading his plays and viewing them in performance. On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",Douglas S Pfeiffer,5:30pm,8:40pm,10262,,S3233-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3233-20242-001/,405 Kent Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3233S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10263,,S3273-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3273-20242-001/,401 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3399,Home to Harlem: Literature and Culture o,"This course explores the cultural contexts and aesthetic debates surrounding the Harlem or New Negro literary renaissance, 1920s to 1930s. Through fiction, poetry, essays, and artwork, we will consider the movement within the context of American modernism and African American cultural history, focusing on the relationship or tension between art/literature and socio-political change. Topics considered include: patronage, passing, primitivism, and the problematics of creating a “racial” art in/for a community comprised of differences in gender, class, sexuality, and geographical origin. We will work with the Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana at the Columbia Rare Book and Manuscript Library to think through the era's cultural history and the impact of different archival media on its historiography.",Monica L Miller,9:00am,12:10pm,11660,,S3399-20242-001,Home to Harlem: Literatur,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3399-20242-001/,405 Kent Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3399S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3748,Modern Drama and the History of Acting,"In the professional theatre, the actor’s craft offers a serious methodology for textual interpretation. This course brings acting theory and practical acting exercises into the English literature classroom as tools to aid in analyzing modern drama. Because innovations in playwriting and acting often have arisen in tandem, the semester will take us on a tour of landmark 20th-century plays and developments in western theatre history. We will spend the beginning of each class session (around thirty minutes) on-our-feet, experimenting with a performance exercise from the week’s acting readings. We will then devote the remainder of each class session to a roundtable seminar discussion about the week’s play.
  
In addition to offering a new methodology for close-reading and enlivening new avenues of interpretation, acting’s traditional focus on the “character” or “role” will raise large questions about the human: What are the nature and limits of identification and empathy? Which acting styles encourage practitioners to seek something universal in human emotion or experience? Conversely, which propose to investigate the historical and cultural specificity of human behavior? Can the process of constructing a character shed light on the social construction of gender, race, and disability?

ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.
  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order): 
The Sopranos
; 
The Wire

Deadwood
;

ENGL S3851,PARADISE LOST,"This class will focus on John Milton’s 1667 epic poem about the creation of the world and the fall of humanity; Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel about a scientist’s creation of life; and Toni Morrison’s 1997 novel about a small, rural, all-black town in Oklahoma. In addition to the explicit echoes between these books, each work is interested in the relationship between the natural world and human beings; gender difference, relations between the sexes, and the reproduction of human life; and the bases of, and threats to, an ideal society. By reading these three works of art in sequence, we will thus look at how authors engage similar issues in different ways, paying particular attention to the role of history, nation, genre, politics, literary tradition, and authorial identity. Finally, we will consider the ways in which authors’ revising, refuting, and re-envisioning of “source” texts affects our readings of the “source” texts as much as the new.",Julie Crawford,9:00am,12:10pm,12253,,S3851-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3851-20242-001/,613 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3851S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3915,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"“Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.”― Michel de Montaigne “There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard, The Writing Life “Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,1:00pm,4:10pm,10267,,S3915-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3915-20242-001/,424 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3915S001,SEMINAR

Readings will include wordless works by Shaun Tan, classic works by Alison Bechdel, as well as many that may be less familiar. Students will analyze the American, Asian, and European approaches to comics. Guest speakers from the comics industry will aid in developing students' analytical skills.

ENGL S4930,MADE IN AMER: MAFIA IN CINEMA,"In this course (whose title is taken from the name of the final episode of The Sopranos) we focus on America’s three greatest practitioners of the so-called “Mafia Movie.” In the first half of the course we examine representations of Mafia in the films of Coppola and Scorsese; in the second half, we perform a comprehensive reading of The Sopranos, a serial that redefined not only the gangster genre, but the aesthetic possibilities of television itself. In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television. Critical avenues privileged will include gender, sexuality, criminal and political economy, poetics of place, internationalism, dialect, plurilingualism and the politics of language, ethnicity and race, diaspora, philosophies of violence, philosophies of power.",Stefan Pedatella,1:00pm,4:10pm,10269,,S4930-20242-001,MADE IN AMER: MAFIA IN CI,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S4930-20242-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242ENGL4930S001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3804,British Women Writers: the Woman Questio,"This course will examine British women writers including Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf in the context of the (long-) nineteenth-century ""Woman Question"". Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman’s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of “woman’s nature” in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman’s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between “inward impulse and outward fact”? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: “What does a woman want?”",Aileen G Forbes,9:00am,12:10pm,10265,,W3804-20242-001,British Women Writers,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3804-20242-001/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242ENGL3804W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3808,The Novel and Economic Justice,"Global capitalism inspired novelists to explore the ways in which money, or the lack of it, forms or deforms our characters.    It also inspired the writings of Karl Marx, the great theorist of economic justice.  In this seminar we will read three early novels – Behn’s 
Orinooko
, Godwin’s  
Caleb Williams
, Austen’s 
Persuasion
 alongside Marxist theory, and then examine a cluster of twentieth century global novels in English.   We will pay special attention to Marxist notions of materialism; alienation and human flourishing; capital and labor; classes; and ideology.  Special emphasis will also be given to the Marxist approach in the study of culture, the role of intellectuals (such as ourselves) and the relationship between capitalism and culture – through theorists like Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, and Raymond Williams.     
  
The course tracks how key Marxist concepts such as capital and class consciousness, reification, commodification, totality, and alienation have been developed across these traditions and considers how these concepts have been used to rethink literary and mass cultural forms and their ongoing transformation in a changing world system. Writers discussed may include Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Georg Lukács, Mikhail Bakhtin, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, C.L.R.

ENGL W3595,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL: GENRE AND,"In the late seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel.  It told the stories – not of the princes and princesses – but of ordinary people on extraordinary voyages, from villages to the Metropolis, from England to Africa and the Americas. In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century – country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.
  
Why does the novel appear?  What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society?  Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?  To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.  Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen. Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,
 Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.  Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",Ross T Hamilton,5:30pm,8:40pm,10264,,S3595-20242-001,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NO,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3595-20242-001/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242ENGL3595S001,SEMINAR

ENGP BC1204,CHANGES SPACES AND MOBILITIES: WOMEN IN,"The turn-of-the-century United States was a nation on the cusp of a number of momentous social, cultural, and political movements. One of the biggest changes was in the status and role of women. From the emergence of the New Woman in the last decade of the 19th century, to the suffragette in the 1910s and the flapper in the 1920s, the roles and positions of women were expanding and evolving in unprecedented ways. Coupled with the growth and expansion of cities, women’s mobility and the spaces they occupied changed dramatically during this time period. In this course, we will examine texts that depict the situation of women and their mobility in various social and cultural contexts in the shifting urban landscape of early twentieth-century New York City. What spaces were women allowed/expected to occupy? What spaces were considered taboo or off limits? What were the effects and consequences of the spaces that women occupied? How did women’s mobility differ to men’s? How do race and class impact mobility and space? What factors influenced women’s mobility and how did these factors change/develop over time?

EPID P6400,Principles of Epidemiology I,"Epidemiology is one of the pillars of public health.  Epidemiologists study the distribution and determinants of disease in human populations; they also develop and test ways to prevent and control disease.  The discipline covers the full range of disease occurrence, including genetic and environmental causes for both infectious and noninfectious diseases.  Increasingly, epidemiologists view causation in the broadest sense, as extending from molecular factors at the one extreme, to social and cultural determinants at the other.  This course introduces students to the theory, methods, and body of knowledge of epidemiology.  Principles of Epidemiology is designed for students in all fields of public health.

Topics include sample size calculations, clustered data, interrupted time series analysis, multilevel modeling, and longitudinal data analysis techniques. The course will take place over six 3.5-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods covered which will be followed by a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises implementing the analytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Course assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizzes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis and present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset).

ERMC PS5430,LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT,"Indicators of companies running into hard times typically include revenue volatility, loss of key personnel, reputational damage, and increased litigation. However, company failures are frequently marked by insufficient liquidity, or the lack of cash to meet obligations. Liquidity risk is the unexpected change in a company’s cash resources or demands on such resources that results in the untimely sale of assets, and/or an inability to meet contractual demands and/or default. In extreme cases, the lack of sufficient cash creates severe losses and results in company bankruptcy.
  
An institution’s cash resources and obligations can and must be managed. Indeed, the field of liquidity risk management is an established part of treasury departments at sizable institutions. The regularity of cash flows and the turbulence of business and markets must be assessed and quantified.

FILM BC1020,NEW YORK CITY IN FILM,"This course will explore the representation of New York City in film. We will examine the way that film portrays social problems and either creates or responds to “social panics.” We will also examine the way in which film actively creates an idea of “New York” through cinematography, directing, acting and other aspects of filmmaking.  Some topics to be considered are utopia/dystopia, race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, art, immigration, houselessness, and gentrification. The course follows three main themes: 1. How the filmmaking process (camera movements, lighting, dialogue, acting, etc.) is used as a method to describe space (filmmaking as a geographic method). 2. How various genres of film have been used to portray the social geography of New York City (the geography of film). 3. The relationship between the viewer’s “place” and the places portrayed in the film (communication geography). Finally, we will also consider how our personal sense of place towards New York City has altered throughout the course.",Ross T Hamilton,5:30pm,8:40pm,00041,,X1020-20242-001,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/X1020-20242-001/,328 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,,3,,MW,20242FILM1020X001,SEMINAR

FILM S3022,SUPERHERO MOVIES AND NEW YORK,"In 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie
, plumes of dust fill the New York City streets as the monster Bowser attacks the city. Mario, seemingly beaten, hides in a pizzeria. What inspires him to keep fighting? He sees himself in a TV ad for his plumbing business, wearing a superhero cape and flying next to the Freedom Tower. He finds solace in the representation of himself as a superhero and in a city that refused to concede that the game was over after 9/11. Such a scene is emblematic of a seminar that will explore the superhero’s relationship to the city’s history and its traumas. Our eye will move between Hollywood blockbusters and global art cinema to help us mull how the superhero exemplifies, for some, the excesses of the U.S. during the global War on Terror. We will see Batman’s alter-ego Bruce Wayne run towards what looks like an imploding World Trade Center on 9/11 (
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
) and witness the superhero framed as an ideological smokescreen for the callous administration of George W. Bush who used the attacks to justify an endless war (
The Broken Circle Breakdown
).
  
While strongly focused on the post-9/11 superhero and its links to New York City, the cross-media seminar will track the superhero’s initial rise in popularity during the trauma of World War II. It will mobilize the archival resources of Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library collections around the papers of noted 
X-Men 
writer Chris Claremont, so students can read how the artist conceived of bringing histories around the Holocaust into his spectacular stories. Such dips into the archives will help us assess how such empowered figures offer surprising routes of representation for the disenfranchised. We will also consider the authoritarian possibilities of the vigilante Batman, situating Frank Miller’s 
The Dark Knight Returns
 against a cultural study that draws links between the comic and Bernhard Goetz who killed four black teenagers in a Manhattan subway in 1984. To further frame how the superhero serves as a potent means of socio-political critique, acclaimed artists and writers will be invited into the classroom. These include Paul Pope whose 
Batman: Year 100
 (2006) presents a dystopian superhero that allegorizes the oppressive aspects of the War on Terror’s surveillance regime. A culminating field trip to the National September 11 Memorial Museum will be organized. There, students will visit “The World Trade Center",Fareed Ben-Youssef,1:00pm,4:10pm,10341,,S3022-20242-001,SUPERHERO MOVIES AND NEW,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3022-20242-001/,507 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242FILM3022S001,SEMINAR
FILM S3023,VIDEO GAMES AND FILM,"Cinema and videogames are moving-image-based media, and, especially over the past two decades, they have been credited with influencing each other. But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms. The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums. The course will culminate in a final presentation where students will adapt an existing intellectual property, preferably a film or TV show, into a video game (or vice versa), justifying their creative choices.",Nick Braccia,1:00pm,4:10pm,10342,,S3023-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3023-20242-001/,504 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242FILM3023S001,SEMINAR

We will also examine the presence of “the global” within the United States, which involves exploring questions of immigration, border-crossing, and transnational co-production. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (AI, virtual and augmented reality), star-studded film festivals, and the reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda.

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10092,,S3116-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S3116-20242-001/,652 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,4,,MW,20242HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the

The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties.

HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

HRTS S4010,Indigenous Rights and Settler Colonialis,"Course Description
  
This interdisciplinary course explores both the rights of Indigenous people in settler colonies as well as the complex historical and theoretical relationship between human rights and settler colonialism. We will pursue three lines of questioning. The first critically explores how central political concepts of the international state system—sovereignty, property, territory, self-determination—entwine the histories of settler colonialism and human rights. The second charts the rise and mechanisms of the international Indigenous rights movement, in particular its activity at the United Nations leading to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, and its contributions to ongoing debates on environmental and climate justice, group rights, natural resources and territorial autonomy, and cultural rights. The third unit interrogates settler state responses to the movement for Indigenous human rights, such as cooptation, recognition, and apology.
  
Through readings drawn from history, ethnography, political and critical theory, international relations, Native studies, law, and documents produced by intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, we will explore and deepen the tensions between human rights as a theory and practice and the political lives and aspirations of Indigenous peoples and activists. What technologies of rule—such as residential school systems and property law—do settler colonial states deploy to dispossess Indigenous peoples? How have Indigenous peoples used the international human rights regime to mobilize against such dispossession? How have these states resisted the global Indigenous rights movement? And can the human rights regime, rooted in the international state system, meaningfully contribute to anticolonial movements in liberal settler colonies? While we will touch on settler colonialism as it manifests around the globe—including in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Israel—the course’s geographical focus will be on North America.

IKNS PS5301,Strategic Consulting for Knowledge-based,"The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with the typical phases of an internal or external consulting project. The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,  phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A  typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor/client  relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a  variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or  product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and  the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and  proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.
  
Successful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the  client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on  the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to  work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual  and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment.

: This 1 semester course (elective, IKNS students only, hybrid) provides an opportunity for a student to extend or supplement their educational experience via a deep-dive into an established or novel area of research of their choice (the topic), under the guidance & supervision of a faculty member (the supervisor). An independent study course allows a student to work one-on-one with a faculty member to gain & contribute new insight into the discipline of Knowledge Management.
  
Topic/objective
: The topic is chosen by the student as long as it falls within the general realm of Knowledge Management or its specific content areas in the IKNS curriculum, such as IT systems, knowledge organizing systems, data repositories, business data analytics including machine learning & AI, learning processes, collaboration, dialogue, team & project management, transformational leadership, change management, digital transformation, or digital product innovation. The course will therefore serve the dual purpose of allowing a student to pursue their own intellectual curiosity & to make a contribution to the wider discipline of Knowledge Management. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the content they acquired in other courses, by applying this content to the specific topic chosen for the Independent Study.
  
Logistics
: Ahead of registration, the student meets with the supervisor to discuss & agree on (i) the topic & the relevant IKNS curriculum area(s); (ii) the timeline of deliverables, milestones, & contact hours for the semester; & (iii) the number of credits. The student summarizes these points in a ~1 pg

INTL S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10031,,S6559-20242-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6559-20242-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242INTL6559S001,SEMINAR

This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication.

MATH UN2015,Linear Algebra and Probability,"Linear algebra with a focus on probability and statistics. The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a priori background in the life sciences is assumed.
  
This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.
  
Math majors, joint majors, and math concentrators must take MATH UN2010 Linear Algebra or MATH UN1207 Honors Math A, which focus on linear algebra concepts and foundations that are needed for upper-level math courses. MATH UN2015 (Linear Algebra and Probability) does NOT replace MATH UN2010 (Linear Algebra) as prerequisite requirements of math courses. Students may not receive full credit for both courses MATH UN2010 and MATH UN2015.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:10pm,10200,,W1001-20242-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Dabashi,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W1001-20242-001/,141 Uris Hall,In-Person,,4,,TR,20242MDES1001W001,LECTURE

Instructor:
 Madeleine Dobie
  
Taught in English. 
  
This course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. 
  
This course examines the social, political and cultural history of migration in the Mediterranean,
 with a particular focus on France and Africa. We examine the forces that have underpinned
 migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions
 in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an
 object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political,
 social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres
 and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with
 questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between
 politics and the arts.

MTFC M9751,Matriculation And Facilities HNUT,"Continuous registration
 is required of MS students until all requirements (including the Thesis) have been completed. Continuous registration means the student must be registered each and every semester or, he or she must be on an official leave of absence. If continuous registration is not maintained, the student must apply for readmission to the Graduate School. ‘Continuous Registration’ includes summer sessions.
  
Students can satisfy the continuous registration requirement and maintain their current status by registering for Matriculation and Facilities (MTCF9751), allowing them access to all University facilities.  It is important for students to request leaves of absence in writing for any term in which they will be away from the University. This may be for reasons of ill health, maternity or paternity leave, military service, or other reasons deemed to be acceptable for leave by the University. If a student does not officially request a leave of absence and does not register for a semester, the student MUST apply for readmission to the University before registration is allowed.  Prior to submitting the leave of absence form, students must meet with their advisor to discuss academic progress, plans, and leave. Students should understand that taking a leave during the period in which the Department has offered support may result in a loss of funding. To request a leave of absence, submit the completed Leave of Absence form, available online at

NECR PS5107,Organizational Conflict and Mediation,"This required NECR course will introduce the concepts and skills of mediation, a type of third-party conflict intervention. This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict.

The course will be a blend of concepts and skills, theory and practice. On some occasions, you will be introduced to a concept and then asked to apply those concepts in an experiential activity. At other times, you will be asked to engage the activity or simulation and then the concepts will be elicited based on your experience.

NECR PS5202,APPLIED CONFLICT RESOLUTION: FROM THEORY,"This course explores the intersection of theory and practice in conflict resolution, giving students the opportunity to apply the models, frameworks, and theories they have studied in the NECR program to real-world scenarios. Students will analyze case studies, review current events, and bring to bear their own experiences in international, organizational, community, and interpersonal conflicts in an interactive setting as they continue to develop and hone their critical thinking skills.
  
Drawing from the disciplines of social psychology and clinical psychology, political science, international relations, and the latest advances in neuroscience, conflict resolution practitioners have at their disposal a wealth of research that can inform their analysis of how to assist parties to mitigate, de-escalate, and prevent conflict.  
  
Building especially on the material covered in Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (PS5101), the participants in this class will engage with the course readings, instructors, and each other to critically analyze and deconstruct complex conflicts in a variety of contexts. A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used in the effort to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Multiculturalism, negotiation and mediation frameworks, accounting for bias, interdependency, intergroup conflict, social identity, peacebuilding, and power dynamics are among the key learnings integrated into the course.
  
The competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life.

NECR PS5210,CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEM,"Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) is a methodology developed in the hard sciences to understand complex systems—from the weather to the functioning of cells, using mathematical algorithms. We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",Camilo Azcarate,9:00am,5:00pm,11676,,K5210-20242-H01,CONF RESOLUTION/DYNAMIC S,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5210-20242-H01/,308A Lewisohn Hall,In-Person,,3,,MTW,20242NECR5210KH01,LECTURE

NECR PS5250,Open Source Intelligence: Research for C,"The elective ""Open Source Intelligence: Research for Conflict Analysis""
 
course is designed to introduce students to key practical insights, tips, and professional skills necessary for any successful conflict resolution practitioner. In this course, students will be required to practically apply some of the tools and techniques of NECR, and appreciate the importance of combining and reformulating the basic NECR concepts in order to serve their exact needs in the field. 
  
Through this course, students have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the classroom, learn additional practical research skills, and adjust them to their own very specific professional aspirations in the field. This course also helps students strategize their next professional steps in the field in a concise, methodical way. 
  
It is important to keep in mind that the Conflict Resolution field at large is quite diverse, and our students have unique backgrounds and future aspirations. Therefore, this course is customized in coordination with each student during 1-on-1 sessions that take place at the beginning of the semester, in order for each student to be working on something that is clear, and has practical value for his/her very specific professional interests. 
  
As with many things in life, proactiveness, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit are keys to success for our very challenging field.  Each student will be having a required 1-on-1 session with the instructor, where the instructor will help the student explore ways to creatively strategize their next professional steps as practitioners and also develop the instructions for the final paper that match the needs of the student.

NECR PS5270,SPECIAL TOPICS: Social Justice and Confl,"Safety is a deceptively simple concept. On one end of the spectrum, it is a tangible state of being (Are you at risk of physical violence?) and immediate feeling (Are you comfortable walking alone at night?). At the other end, safety is a broader system embedded in a complex network of social relations, formal and informal organizations, and political dynamics: Do you trust your neighbors? Do you trust the police? Do you have access to the resources you need to be and feel safe from harm? In New York City, the problem of public safety presents a complex tapestry of conflicts, deeply rooted in varying attitudes and policies. The city's approach to public safety often stirs up debates around policing strategies, with some advocating for a robust, proactive law enforcement presence to deter crime, and others calling for more community-based, social justice-oriented methods. And this is only about policing. Most people will say that for them, safety is about much more than policing. Such complexity has led to a broad array of tensions and conflicts in New York City, particularly in neighborhoods like the three in this course, where residents often feel both over-policed and under-resourced.
  
In this course, we will draw on an active research project under the leadership of Dr. Peter Dixon and Dr. Geraldine Downey, which is collecting community-based data around the city to answer two questions: how do residents from communities impacted by violence and policing define safety for themselves? And, what makes these grounded definitions more or less relevant for actual public safety policy? Working in three neighborhoods across Manhattan (Harlem), Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant), and the Bronx (South Bronx), students in this course will work with this community-based data, engaging with municipal decision makers and community members to apply a conflict resolution lens to the rich—and often contradictory—perspectives that city residents bring to the seemingly simple question of what it means to be safe.
  
This course is scheduled to take place in person, in accordance with campus COVID-19 policies. Students are expected to spend on average, 10 hours per week including class time, group work, readings and other assignments, plus one intensive weekend. Throughout, we will engage with city officials and NYC community members to co-analyze residents’ public safety priorities and co-create policy solutions and resolution strategies.",Peter Dixon,9:00am,5:00pm,11675,,K5270-20242-001,Social Justice & Conflict,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5270-20242-001/,NONE NONE,In-Person,,3,,S,20242NECR5270K001,SEMINAR

practice the skills of negotiation, mediation, and facilitation.
  
 
To intervene as skilled practitioners, conflict-resolution professionals

NOPM PS5350,Leading with Purpose: Advocacy and Strat,"In an era defined by unprecedented global challenges and opportunities, nonprofit advocacy serves as a powerful force for systemic reform and public innovation. This course immerses students in the intersection of theory and practice through an 
advocacy practicum
 approach—designed to equip future nonprofit leaders with the skills to influence policy, mobilize communities, and drive systemic change.
  
In the context of the ever evolving policy landscape of New York City and providing a global lens, this course offers an in-depth exploration of advocacy fundamentals within the nonprofit sector. Through real-world case studies, hands-on projects, and interactive fieldwork, students have the opportunity to examine how advocacy efforts in New York City—a hub of civic engagement—can expand broader policy frameworks and cross into international contexts.
  
Over the term, students will explore the theoretical foundations of advocacy, including social movement theory, policy influence, and public opinion formation. They will engage in stakeholder analysis, coalition-building, and the creation of advocacy strategies tailored to shifting political, economic, and social dynamics. Central to this course will be discussions on how traditional advocacy approaches are being redefined in response to growing inequalities and systemic challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptable, intersectional strategies to confront global disparities.
  
The framework emphasizes practical application: students will have the opportunity to develop and implement real advocacy plans, leveraging digital tools, media, and virtual organizing strategies to enhance their impact. Fieldwork, simulations, and collaborative projects will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to tangible issues, empowering them to lead efforts that address pressing social challenges, whether locally in New York City or globally in areas such as international development and human rights.
  
Key topics include:
  
  
Crafting advocacy strategies that influence public policy in divided political environments;
  
Building and managing coalitions across stakeholders;
  
Engaging marginalized communities to ensure inclusive and equitable advocacy efforts;
  
Navigating the digital advocacy landscape to design impactful campaigns.

PHIL S3601,METAPHYSICS,"This course will survey topics in contemporary metaphysics. We will focus on material objects, time, modality, causation, properties, and natural kinds. We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds. The section will conclude with problems about the metaphysics of socially constructed kinds such as race or gender.",Noah Betz-Richman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10246,,S3601-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),PHIL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHIL/S3601-20242-001/,716 Philosophy Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242PHIL3601S001,LECTURE

POLP BC1000,American Gun Violence: Causes and Conseq,"In the sociology course, we examine the American epidemic of gun violence through a sociological perspective. In the first week, we’ll look at what it means to think sociologically and explore the larger context of gun violence as a racialized and gendered phenomenon. In the second week, we will explore neighborhood gun violence, school (mass) shootings, and police violence as case studies to understand the root causes of violence and the short- and long-term impacts on many groups of people. In the third week, we’ll try to tie it all together by looking at promising solutions to various types of gun violence. One theme across the course will be a sociological consideration of grief and other emotions in the aftermath of gun violence -- as not just personal feelings, but emotions experienced socially, shaped by and through social interactions, and subject to social rules and restrictions which too often reflect larger societal inequalities. We will also highlight the kinds of resilience, resistance, and activism that emerge from individuals and communities after experiences of gun violence. We will examine policy debates as sociologists trying to understand their contours, the social issues at their core, and the ways political responses also reflect and even perpetuate social inequalities. Together, we’ll attempt to make sense of our three seemingly disparate case studies as part of a larger problem, explore the affective dimensions that shape this problem, and the way attuning ourselves to social and public emotions may help us see potential solutions",Nora M Gross,2:00pm,4:30pm,00117,,X1000-20242-001,American Gun Violence,Pre-College Program (Barnard),POLP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLP/X1000-20242-001/,To be announced,,,0,,W,20242POLP1000X001,LECTURE
POLP BC1001,"Radicalization and Education: Insight, P","Radicalization, both online and offline, poses significant challenges to societies worldwide. This course provides a comprehensive examination of the complex interplay between radicalization and education. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and practical exercises, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of radicalization and its implications for education and society at large. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will gain insights into the processes, mechanisms, and dynamics of radicalization within educational settings. The course explores the theoretical frameworks and concepts related to radicalization, including the socio-psychological factors, group dynamics, and ideological influences that contribute to an individual's susceptibility to radical ideologies. Students will examine case studies and real-world examples to understand the various forms of radicalization, from religious extremism to political extremism. A central focus of the course is the role of education in both perpetuating and mitigating radicalization. Students will critically analyze the ways in which educational institutions can serve as breeding grounds for radical ideologies, as well as the potential of education to promote critical thinking, resilience, and social cohesion as a means of countering radicalization. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to critically assess and respond to radicalization within educational contexts, contributing to efforts to promote tolerance, diversity, and social cohesion.",,9:30am,12:00pm,00118,,X1001-20242-001,Radicalization and Educat,Pre-College Program (Barnard),POLP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLP/X1001-20242-001/,To be announced,,,0,,W,20242POLP1001X001,LECTURE
POLP BC1456,Gone Viral: Public Health in a Global Co,"This course examines the rapidly evolving social, cultural, behavioral, political, and socioeconomic dimensions of public health in community, national, regional, and global contexts. We consider how health as well as the generation of knowledge about health are being continually re-shaped by factors such as age, gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, social class, geography, and interactions within physical and digital environments. We learn how to analyze dynamic public health problems and identify agile solutions by casting light on individual risk factors as well as larger structural forces. We consider how social media enables the rapid proliferation of hotly contested messages and information about the rights of the individual versus the welfare of the public. Finally, we critically examine the ways in which our understandings of health and well-being perpetually shape, and are shaped by, health care systems in flux, the mediation of our own values, and our changing assumptions about the world.

Short videos, social media content, and documentary films supplement the readings, providing a diversified basis for lively collegial debate. Concurrent with class sessions, students also engage in basic research outside of the classroom by conducting rapid ethnographic assessment.

POLS S3527,CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN POLITICS,"Since WWII, in a stunning historical turnaround, much of Europe has gone from centuries of war to an increasingly inclusive project of peaceful and innovative regional cooperation. Yet, despite such apparent success, the EU has recently come to face countless challenges: the European democratic deficit, the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, Euro-skepticism, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some observers have even come to question the limits of European integration.
  
 In this course, we will focus on the contemporary chapter of European politics, asking crucial questions of the integration process. How do national, intergovernmental, and supranational dynamics play out across policy areas? What are the colonial and neocolonial roots of European politics? How have European politics evolved in response to the many recent crises? What further developments should we expect? Will member states follow the path of ever-greater integration and eventually form a federation? Will the European Union fall apart? Will the integration project develop into a multi-speed, modular governance system?
  
 With these questions in mind, this course will explore the politics of the European Union across a diverse array of policy domains. Building on a foundational two sessions on the history and structure of the EU, each week will tackle a core policy realm: the economy, migration, common security, foreign policy, the environment – to name a few.

POLS UN3108,Democracy: Theory & Practice,"The goal of this course is to provide students with an overview of constitutive debates over the theory and practice of democracy along three major lines: democracy as a word (with a time-honored ancestry and a tortuous trajectory across the centuries); democracy as a constellation of principles and values; and democracy as an array of institutions and procedures that instantiate the word and pursue the foundational principles of popular sovereignty and democratic self-rule. In doing so, we will read the work of major representatives of historical and contemporary political thought who assessed democracy’s shortcomings and potential, examined the relationship between its theory and its practice, and offered prominent resources for thinking about democracy’s future in our present.",David Ragazzoni,1:00pm,4:10pm,10310,,S3108-20242-D01,Democracy: Theory & Pract,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3108-20242-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20242POLS3108SD01,LECTURE
POLS UN3116,Borders and Immigration,"Today, the movement of peoples across the Earth and consistent attempts to control or prevent that movement are ubiquitous global phenomena. There is hardly any land on the planet that is not claimed as the territory of one state or another. Borders have become the most common, although by no means only, site in which states try to assert their power over movement. The causes, impacts, and ethical stakes of border crossings have become fixtures of both national and international political discourse.
  
This course will examine questions about the politics and ethics of borders and immigration in the modern world. To inform our discussion, we will engage with ideas from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including political theory, history, law, political science, and sociology. While this course will focus on the US context and pay special attention to the history and dynamics of US immigration policy, we will also survey how immigration and borders intersect with global politics.
  
This course is designed to be a 6-week intensive class. The first two weeks concern foundational questions and key concepts. These include the question of what constitutes membership in a political community (citizenship), what exactly borders are and what functions they serve.  Week 3 turns to the question of why people migrate, what the most prominent migration policy regimes are, and the history and present state of American immigration policy. Week 4 turns to the moral question of whether states 
should
 be entitled to their territory and, if so, whether they have a right to control their borders. We will examine debates both for and against open borders. Week 5 examines further questions on who immigration regimes prioritize and who they do not. Week 6 turns to the causes, law, and ethics of refugees and asylum seekers.",Benjamin W Mueser,9:00am,12:10pm,10320,,S3116-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3116-20242-001/,306 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242POLS3116S001,LECTURE
POLS UN3210,JUDICIAL POLITICS,"This political science course provides an introduction to the politics of judges, courts, and law in the United States.  We will evaluate law and courts as political institutions and judges as political actors and policy-makers.
  
The topics we will study include what courts do; how different legal systems function; the operation of legal norms; the U.S. judicial system; the power of courts; constraints on judicial power; judicial review; the origin of judicial institutions; how and why Supreme Court justices make the decisions they do; case selection; conflict between the Court and the other branches of government; decision making and conflict within the judicial hierarchy; the place of courts in American political history; and judicial appointments.
  
We will explore some common but not necessarily true claims about how judges make decisions and the role of courts.  One set of myths sees judges as unbiased appliers of neutral law, finding law and never making it, with ideology, biography, and politics left at the courthouse door. Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the “least dangerous branch,” making law, not policy, without real power or influence.
  
Our thematic questions will be:  How much power and discretion do judges have in the U.S?  What drives their decision-making?",Jeffrey R Lax,1:00pm,4:10pm,10321,,W3210-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3210-20242-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242POLS3210W001,LECTURE

POLS UN3919,Seminar in Political Theory,"With the rise of extreme weather events as a consequence of climate change, the demand for “climate justice” has become a popular backdrop for environmental and climate movements to demand more specific political action to address the climate crisis. This course will cover the origins and development of the concept of environmental justice and its relationship to issues of race and power, as well as the transition from environmental justice to climate justice and its political implications today. Establishing the connection of environmental and climate justice principles to existing political institutions, the course will also include a field trip to visit South Bronx Unite and do a walking tour of heavily polluted waterways in the Bronx. Additionally, students will choose an institution or movement of their choice and create a report which analyses what concepts of justice these institutions refer to, what their goals and demands are, and how their strategies relate to these demands and where they might be falling short.",Rebecca S Marwege,1:00pm,4:10pm,11908,,S3919-20242-001,Environ & Climate Justice,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3919-20242-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242POLS3919S001,SEMINAR

PUBH P6795,Applying Community Engagement Principles,"The need for more effective and equitable engagement with communities has become increasingly evident to public health professionals in recent years. Now, more than ever, the importance of developing deeper and more engaged academic/institutional-community partnerships is necessary to address systems of structural inequity. However, developing these relationships requires not only knowledge of equity-based partnering formats, but the cultivation of complex skill sets that allow public health practitioners to fully develop relationships across all phases of community collaboration. Two valuable forms of community engagement that public health practitioners and students can make use of are community-based participatory research and service learning, which are the focus of the ACEP seminar. Additionally, this seminar acknowledges that community engagement is a diverse space where people from a variety of professional and personal backgrounds come together and provides knowledge and skills in important interprofessional competencies that are necessary for public ACEP Seminar, 2024 2 of 15 health professionals to understand and be able to deploy. For many years, people working in the technology space have recognized the benefits of “matrixed teams,” similarly over the past few years the notion of interprofessionalism has become an important and required aspect of allied health and public health professional training. Research has shown that bringing together students from two or more professions to learn about, from, and with each other is extremely effective in all forms of collaboration (within research and intervention teams and with communities) and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes. According to the World Health Organization, “Once students understand how to work interprofessionally, they are ready to enter the workplace as a member of the collaborative practice team. This is a key step in moving health systems from fragmentation to a position of strength.” The overall goal of the ACEP seminar is for students to learn about and begin to practice the tenets of three frameworks: Interprofessional Education (IPE), Service-Learning (SL), and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). Additionally, students will be supported in problem solving changes /problems that arise during their APEx. With regard to interprofessional engagement, the seminar will provide students with a solid understanding of four key IPE competencies: roles/responsibilities, teams/teamwork, ethics/values,",Carole L Hutchinson,,,13727,,P6795-20242-001,ACEP Seminar,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6795-20242-001/,,On-Line Only,,0-1.5,,,20242PUBH6795P001,SEMINAR
QMSS GR5067,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING SOCIAL SCIENCES,"Social scientists need to engage with natural language processing (NLP) approaches that are found in computer science, engineering, AI, tech and in industry. This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",Patrick Houlihan,5:30pm,8:40pm,10316,,G5067-20242-001,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING S,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5067-20242-001/,311 Fayerweather,In-Person,,3,,MT,20242QMSS5067G001,SEMINAR
QMSS GR5075,Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Social Sc,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI – like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Gemini – are poised to change the world for everyone. It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class – through readings and a dozen hands-on activities – students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI’s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people’s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI’s “weirdness.” Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills – like in critical thinking and empathy – in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, “So far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1/36th of the time, thanks to AI. AI is wild!"" By the end of this class, students will feel empowered technically and philosophically to handle all new generative AI developments. There are no specific prerequisites for this class.",Gregory M Eirich,9:00am,12:10pm,12840,,G5075-20242-002,AI and Social Science,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5075-20242-002/,222 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242QMSS5075G002,LECTURE

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ).

SCIP BC0127,The Exploration of Space,"For millennia, humans have gazed in wonder at the stars.  Every culture developed its own mythology to make sense of the patterns in the night sky.  Then, in the last century, something amazing happened.  Our technology caught up to our wonder and we learned how to “slip the surly bonds of Earth.”  For the past six decades, some of our most cleverly designed machines and daring explorers have helped us dip our toes into the vast cosmic ocean that surrounds our little blue marble of a home.  In this course, we will study the people, science, and technology that have brought humanity some of its most captivating and unifying moments, from Isaac Newton to Neil Armstrong, from 
Sputnik
 to the James Webb Telescope.  At the same time, we will examine the social and political reasons why nations devote talent and resources to sending those machines and people into space in the first place.  We will also study the technical and human causes of noted disasters, such as 
Challenger
 and 
Columbia.  
Finally, we will consider whether, if we are careful enough, humanity may one day evolve into a truly spacefaring civilization.",,9:30am,12:00pm,00106,,S0127-20242-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),SCIP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SCIP/S0127-20242-001/,To be announced,,,0,,W,20242SCIP0127S001,SEMINAR

SOCW T7601,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment that was originally developed for chronically suicidal individuals and is now the gold standard treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder.  The treatment and its adaptations have since been proven through research to be effective across a wide range of disorders and behavioral problems which have at their core the issue of Pervasive Emotion Dysregulation.   Students will be introduced to key theoretical concepts that inform the “spirit” of DBT, along with an overview of core treatment strategies as used within a DBT skills group. This course is focused on DBT skills, and will provide students with a basic understanding of the four DBT skills modules (Core Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance). The focus will be on the revised and expanded DBT Skills Manual released in late 2014.  Through course assignments and in-class activities, students will have an opportunity to learn the content of the skills, as well as how to structure and conduct a DBT skills group.   Students will develop a beginning understanding of standard comprehensive DBT, the particular function of each treatment component, (e.g., individual, group, consultation team, coaching) and how DBT skills relate to the other program components. The basic format of this course will include the Instructor's presentation of concepts and principles, group discussion, modeling, role-plays, and technique coaching.  As a practice elective, the major focus is on skill development.  As such, students are expected participate fully in in-class practice exercises and be receptive to feedback from their classmates.",Kitama S Cahill-Jackson,4:00pm,6:30pm,12295,,T7601-20242-001,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILL,Social Work,SOCW,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCW/T7601-20242-001/,312 School of Social Work,In-Person,,3,,T,20242SOCW7601T001,SEMINAR

It is designed to prepare students for intensive DBT training and for their DBT internships in the community and for ensuring that program interns are prepared for beginning DBT practice with client populations exhibiting a range of behavioral dysfunctions. These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class.

SOSC P8910,Introduction to Race and Health,"It is widely acknowledged that as a variable, 'race' often explains a significant portion of the variation we observe in patterns of morbidity and mortality. But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct ‘race’ to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",,,,12703,,P8910-20242-001,INTRODUCTION TO RACE & HE,Biostatistics,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P8910-20242-001/,,In-Person,,1,,,20242SOSC8910P001,LECTURE
SPAN BC3305,Sustainable Communities in Ecuador: What,"Indigenous people in Ecuador, which represent about 7% of the Ecuadorian population (United Nations, 2015), are disproportionately poor compared with the rest of the population. In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution. Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis. 
  
The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.  It aims to:
  
1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.
  
2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.
  
3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.
  
4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.
  
5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",Maria E Lozano,9:00am,9:00pm,00003,,X3305-20242-001,SUSTAINABLE COMMUN.

SUMA PS5020,COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS,"This course is about cost-benefit analysis and the economic evaluations of policies and projects. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) consists of a comprehensive set of techniques used to evaluate government programs. It is now routinely applied in such program areas as transportation, water projects, health, training and education, criminal justice, environmental protection, urban policy and even in the international arena such as foreign direct investment. Many of the techniques of CBA can also be applied to private sector decision-making. The objective of CBA is to determine whether the benefits of a particular program, policy or decision outweigh its costs. The techniques used to determine this are sometimes quite simple, but on other, increasingly frequent occasions are highly sophisticated. Sophisticated cost benefit studies are based on a framework that utilizes the basic concepts of economic theory. In addition, statistical and econometric analyses are often needed to estimate program effects from diverse available data. The course has two parts: methodology and practice. The goal is for students to be practically adept to undertake an independent cost-benefit analysis.",Alexander Heil,6:10pm,8:00pm,11578,,K5020-20242-001,,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5020-20242-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242SUMA5020K001,LECTURE

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.  Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked “experts only.”  The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.  Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",Lucius J Riccio,6:10pm,8:00pm,11580,,K5033-20242-001,DECISION MODELS & MGMT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5033-20242-001/,407 Mathematics Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242SUMA5033K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.
  
Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.
  
This course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,11581,,K5035-20242-001,GHG EMISSIONS CARBON FOOT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5035-20242-001/,601 Sherman Fairchild Life Sciences Building,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242SUMA5035K001,LECTURE

The course focuses on the interchange between the external legal, competitive, societal, environmental and policy ‘ecosystems’ corporations face (which vary around the world) and a company’s internal structure, operations and pressures. We will use the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Global Compact Principles (which incorporate all aspects of ESG) as the central frameworks to explore the concept of a corporation’s responsibility to respect and remedy human rights and environmental harms.  We will also examine the Equator Principles and other frameworks that spell out good practices for project finance and other investment decisions, and reference a wide range of the myriad indices, supplier disclosure portals and benchmarks that exist in this inter-disciplinary field.  Relevant regulations, corporate law regimes and court cases will be discussed from the point of view of what business managers need to know.

SUMA PS5195,"ACCOUNTING, FINANCE, AND MODELING OF SUS","This course is designed to provide students with working knowledge on how to make successful investments in sustainable companies and to prepare students to be conversationally literate in financial reporting. As you leave the school and become leaders of organizations financial literacy will be a skill set that will be vital to success no matter what career path you go down. It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.
  
To understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm.

SUMA PS5475,Illuminating Sustainable Pathways with M,"Material flow analysis (MFA) is a foundational tool for aiding decisions concerned with the physical aspects of sustainability. MFA fills crucial data gaps on the state of society’s resource use and provides insights such as inefficiencies in urban systems, misallocation of useful products into landfill, risks in resource security, and business opportunities for enterprises. 
  
These qualities make MFA a premiere tool for enabling the transition to a circular economy at the local, regional, national, and global levels. 
  
As a topic embraced by the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Program, MFA will equip students with a systems view and a versatile skill that will be instrumental for working on many sustainability topics, including a connection with advanced life cycle assessments. Students may particularly be fascinated by the ability of MFA to derive the material footprints of nations and to inform environmental policies. The addition of an MFA course to the Sustainability Management curriculum will contribute greatly to the program’s track record of producing students that “transform organizations by formulating and implementing the sustainability strategies necessary to compete and win in the 21st century.” 
  
The skill is sought after especially in the European Union, where annual reporting of material accounts by member states is mandated. There is also increasing demand of MFA practitioners from local entities, most recently the municipal governments of Portland and Copenhagen, in support of their circular economy and sustainability initiatives.",Koichi Kanaoka,6:10pm,8:00pm,11941,,K5475-20242-001,Material Flow Analysis,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5475-20242-001/,602 Lewisohn Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242SUMA5475K001,LECTURE

SUMA PS6130,Management of SEC Climate Disclosure Com,"This course will teach students how to develop the organizational capacity and management skills
 necessary for compliance with the new SEC Climate Disclosure Regulations. This course will introduce
 regulated ESG reporting, emphasizing climate disclosure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
 (SEC) Climate disclosure will serve as the basis for the discussion and could be used as a case study to
 illustrate the best practices for administering a sustainability reporting regime and sustainability reporting
 more broadly within an organization. By the conclusion of this course, students will be able to design,
 manage, and implement new processes and procedures within their organizations to respond to the new
 SEC Climate Disclosures and other forthcoming regulated and mandatory disclosures.
 To increase comparability, relevancy, and accuracy of the environmental data and sustainability
 information reported by companies on climate and human capital matters, the SEC prioritized climate
 change and ESG regulations throughout 2022, promising new rules to better inform and protect investors
 and other stakeholders. This unprecedented action paves the way for disclosures that were previously
 voluntary to become required. The evolution of the ESG landscape will considerably transform ESG from
 a reputational risk concern to a regulatory-driven activity, thereby increasing the ESG lens/scrutiny at the
 level of financial statements.
 Due to the complexity of this SEC Climate Rule, this course will focus on the SEC Climate Disclosures in
 their first year of implementation so that students can interpret, acquire a deeper understanding of the new
 rules, and develop a Year 1 implementation strategy. To prepare the next generation of sustainability
 leaders to respond to this new regulatory regime, the intended audience of this course consists of
 sustainability leaders from a diversity of industries responsible for climate reporting.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,11593,,K6130-20242-001,Management of SEC Climate,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K6130-20242-001/,307 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242SUMA6130K001,LECTURE

In this class, we discuss racism’s origin story, particularly how capitalist interests motivated the creation of racial hierarchy. We focus on how White-controlled institutions and elite actors mediate racial and ethnic groups’ access to material and social resources, leading to Whites disproportionately benefiting from U.S. social processes. We investigate social processes through intersectional—noting relationships between race, class, and gender—and historical lens, highlighting how racism evolves over time in response to resistance. We also examine the consequences of racism across social domains. Our course concludes by grappling with the questions: (1) How effective have social movements, and other forms of social organization, been in resisting and ending racism? (2) What are the implications for current racial justice activism?",Angela Simms,2:00pm,4:30pm,00100,,S0003-20242-001,"Race, Ethnicity, & US Soc",Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WOMP/S0003-20242-001/,To be announced,,,0,,W,20242WOMP0003S001,SEMINAR

WRIT S4313,WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS,"There are many misconceptions as to what makes an appealing story for children and how to get a story published. Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",Peter Catalanotto,9:00am,12:10pm,10051,,S4313-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Catalanotto,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4313-20242-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242WRIT4313S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,5:30pm,8:40pm,10017,,S4320-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4320-20242-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242WRIT4320S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"The Young Adult (YA) publishing boom has changed the way we read—and write—coming-of-age stories. This course will introduce students to the elements that shape YA novels, and explore the fiction writing techniques needed for long projects, including narrative arcs, character construction, worldbuilding, and scene work. We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",Emily K Austin,1:00pm,4:10pm,10052,,S4323-20242-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4323-20242-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,1:00pm,4:10pm,10053,,S4810-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20242-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20242WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:00pm,4:10pm,10050,,W3215-20242-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20242-001/,409 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20242WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
