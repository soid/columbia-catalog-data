AFAS UN1001,INTRO TO AFRICAN-AMER STUDIES,"Prerequisites: Students need to register for a section of AFAS UN1010, the required discussion section for this course. From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this “New World” democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S. but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the “middle passage” to the present so-called “post-racial” moment—drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature—to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e. agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e. migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e. uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e. Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.).

AHIS GU4654,"Painting in the Mid-Twentieth Century, 1","During the mid-twentieth century painting rose to a hegemonic position among the fine arts, and then quickly descended, at least in the eyes of critics, if not the market. New technologies would enable a host of “new media” that often supplanted and always transformed traditional ones. By the 1960s the dominant narratives that had given abstract painting a logic had lost favor, and new challenges were posed to artists who wanted to work in a medium that was increasingly seen as artistically regressive. As well, institutions that had often tamed radical art in the name of aesthetic sublimation were coming under increasing fire for suppressing—by the choice to show only paintings of a certain, largely “formalist” kind—alternative voices. This course will examine the ways painters negotiated these challenges and gave rise to the proliferation of types of painting that flourished later.",Evan R Neely,5:30pm,8:40pm,10660,Morningside,W4654-20202-001,"20th C Painting, 1929   1",Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/2080,silver,15.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/W4654-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202AHIS4654W001,SEMINAR
AHIS S2314,MASTERS OF THE BAROQUE,"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art—Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Velázquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)—artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",Lindsey P Schneider,1:00pm,4:10pm,10222,Morningside,S2314-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S2314-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,TR,20202AHIS2314S001,LECTURE

AHIS S3442,"""AMER ART IN """"LONG"""" 19TH CENT""","Through an examination of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography and the visual culture of the United States from 1750 to 1914, the course will explore how American artists responded to and operated within the wider world. Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the 'long' nineteenth century, ranging from Romanticism to Modernism. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using, and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the profound changes that occurred during the Civil War. The class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad. In addition to lectures/discussions in the classroom, field trips to the Metropolitan Museum (the American Wing, Nineteenth Century Wing, Galleries of Modem and Contemporary Art, and the Photography Study Collection), the Museum of Modem Art and the Whitney Museum of Art, represent a vital aspect of the course. One of the important questions raised in the class is the recent reinterpretation of American art's interaction with international movements in museum installations and scholarship, moving away from an isolationist approach to one that engages with global influence and awareness. Readings will draw not only from primarily sources, but also from many of the publications of the Terra Foundation, whose exhibitions and research programs work to encourage an understanding and exploration of American Art from a global context.",Page S Knox,9:00am,12:10pm,10225,Morningside,S3442-20202-001,"""AMER ART IN """"LONG"""" 19T",Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/1214,silver,14.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3442-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,4,,TR,20202AHIS3442S001,SEMINAR

AMPO PS0101,Wealth and Democracy in the United State,"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.
 
 Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and/or national level.
 
 Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.
 
 In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.
 
 Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",Geoffrey C Upton,2:10pm,4:00pm,11012,Morningside,K0101-20202-001,Wealth & Democracy in the,Summer High School Program,AMPO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMPO/K0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202AMPO0101K001,LECTURE

ANTH S3921,ANTI-COLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, Aimé Cesairé’s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi’s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,9:00am,12:00pm,10236,Morningside,S3921-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/2077,silver,6.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3921-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202ANTH3921S001,SEMINAR

 This course introduces students to selected monuments of painting, sculpture, and architecture and to basic trends and concepts in the history of art. Examples are drawn from a wide range of periods and cultures. Students are introduced to aspects of visual analysis, historical context, and problems of interpretation.

Both courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis, skills that will be valuable to students in whatever fields they choose to pursue in college and beyond.
 
 What is Architecture?
 An introduction to ways of understanding architecture framed around four topics: Concept, Context, Form, and Materials. Students are challenged to examine and understand the effects of physical environment on human experience, the factors that influence architectural forms, and the role that architecture plays in shaping our behaviors and civic cultures
 
 Participants gain an understanding of architecture through slide presentations, readings, virtual visits to buildings, and discussions around observations and analyses of architecture and public spaces around the world, both iconic and lesser-known. We examine different types of buildings such as museums, churches, libraries, and transportation hubs. While the primary focus is on learning through observation and analysis, students also learn to think and imagine through hands-on, at-home model-making, using materials they should be able to find around their homes.",Aki Ishida,9:10am,11:00am,11969,Morningside,N0103-20202-001,WHAT IS ARCHITECTURE?,Summer High School Program,APAR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/APAR/N0103-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202APAR0103N001,LECTURE

ARCP BC0220,Experiencing Architecture,"This course will use New York City as a resource to convey the physical and intellectual excitement of architecture.  Through presentations, virtual field trips and design problems students will be introduced to the making and meaning of architecture. The course will be based on the studio method in which students are challenged to develop skills through fundamental design projects. The projects will involve instruction in architectural drawing and model making.   We will study the history, appearance and function of several sites. Through sketching and in-studio discussions the class will make connections between the activity of design and the actual built environment which will culminate in a site specific architectural intervention.",Richard T Rouhe,,,00009,Barnard College,S0220-20202-001,EXPERIENCING ARCHITECTURE,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARCP,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ARCP/S0220-20202-001/,,,,0,,,20202ARCP0220S001,SEMINAR

Fashion has also been weaponized and used as a call-to-arms for political, social, gender, and economic reform. This course examines the role of fashion (Victorian to Modern) as a barometer of cultural consciousness, especially in times of oppression and social unrest. Students will create digital mood boards and learn how fashion designers use them, analyze descriptions of fashion in literature, and read about the evolution of fashion from seminal critics including Roland Barthes, Margaret Atwood, and Valerie Steele. We will view virtual museum exhibitions devoted to fashion, create a framework to analyze the role of fashion in modern life, examine fashion magazines, blogs, and Instagram posts through a critical lens, and learn about the design studios of New York fashion designers. Fashion has been dismissed as frivolous by critics, however women including Virginia Woolf and Anna Wintour have refuted that statement. By the end of the course, students will come to their own conclusions, exploring the reasons people might dismiss the role of fashion in culture.",,,,00002,Barnard College,S0275-20202-001,IS FASHION FRIVOLOUS?,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ARTP/S0275-20202-001/,,,,0,,,20202ARTP0275S001,SEMINAR
ASTO PS0101,THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE,"The origin and evolution of the Universe is one of the greatest (and oldest) questions ever asked. In a little over a century,
 cosmology has matured as a discipline due to improvements in our understanding of fundamental physics
 and technological advances allowing us to map the Universe in unprecedented detail and perform complex calculations.
 This course is an introductory review of the standard cosmological model, a quantitative description of the universe that explains
 with only six numbers a wide range of observed phenomena, from the chemical composition of the Universe, to the abundance
 and distribution of galaxies.  The course includes in-class interactive exercises to illustrate how simple mathematical models can shed light on seemingly
 complex systems. We will discuss how the ideas on which the standard model rests won over alternative ideas,
 and how scientists are still working to solve some outstanding puzzles, such as the unknown nature of dark
 matter and dark energy.

BCAB PS0101,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, AI, and Be","This course is designed for students who have an interest in the future of finance, technology, blockchain, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and work. Beginning with an exploration of Fintech (financial technology), we explore technology’s impact on everything from banking to real estate to Wall Street. Additionally, we look at how artificial intelligence (AI) will automate and reduce the need for human workers, as AI, Fintech, and other technologies are combined to automate many tasks.
 
 After gaining a solid understanding of the real-world use cases of Fintech and the everyday ways it impacts the economy, social justice, and our lives, students take a journey of discovery into the world of AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, cryptocurrency and decentralized ledger technology, aka blockchain, have emerged as an economic force majeure, disrupting the fundamentals of how people interact and how they perceive money. In addition to pushing the evolution of money, blockchain technology is now poised to disrupt how we organize businesses and the future of work. Course participants explore the organizational impacts and transformations caused by blockchain and cryptocurrencies and examine what this will mean to them as future CEOs and global business and thought leaders.
 
 The course concludes by exploring the perspective of entrepreneurs and innovators, further examining how technologies come together to form the businesses, disruptions, and methodologies of the 21st Century. Participants walk away with a fundamental understanding of what tokens and cryptocurrencies are; how businesses leverage blockchain technology, AI, and other Fintech applications; and how digital transformation impacts social interactions and the future of work.

BICO PS0211,Conservation Biology and Sustainability:,"Designed for students with a background in biology, this program investigates some of the exciting recent developments in conservation biology. Topics include: what is biodiversity, why is it threatened, and why is it important; habitat alteration and species loss; captive breeding as a conservation tool; conservation genetics; designing protected areas; the effects of exotic species in local ecosystems; conservation medicine; and the impact of global warming on ecosystems and wildlife. The course uses real case studies from current research to take an in-depth look at the challenges in conserving life on earth, and the unique ways scientists and ordinary citizens can make a difference.
 
 Class discussions are supplemented with digital simulations of conservation biology and biodiversity concepts. Students learn how to contribute citizen science data to help us understand biodiversity changes in real time, and make observations of their own ecosystem. The course culminates with a stakeholder analysis and proposal for the creation of a new marine reserve.
 
 Please note: Though this course is intended primarily for older students, it is also open to highly qualified rising freshmen and sophomores.",Lauren Esposito,1:10pm,3:00pm,10726,Morningside,N0211-20202-001,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION-LEC,Summer High School Program,BICO,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Esposito,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BICO/N0211-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202BICO0211N001,LECTURE

BIGD PS0101,"Big Data, Machine Learning, and their Re","The exponential growth of data, advances in cloud computing, and machine learning have transformed every industry from retail and banking to healthcare and education. This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.
 
 We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in either R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics, or Python. Much of the in-class work involves working with one of these two languages. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.
 
 From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.
 
 Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.
 
 Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations.

This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.
 
 We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in either R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics, or Python. Much of the in-class work involves working with one of these two languages. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.
 
 From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.
 
 Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.
 
 Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations. The course features real-world applications of data analytics across industries and challenges students to think in terms of the business value of data and machine learning.",Rajeev Nair,1:10pm,3:00pm,14319,Morningside,N0101-20202-006,BIG DATA,Summer High School Program,BIGD,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIGD/N0101-20202-006/,To be announced,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202BIGD0101N006,LECTURE
BIOL GU4310,VIROLOGY,"The basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:  1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.  2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).  3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.  Despite the apparent simplicity, the tactics evolved by particular virus families to survive and prosper are remarkable. This rich set of solutions to common problems in host/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution.  The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.",Vincent R Racaniello,10:45am,12:20pm,12156,Morningside,W4310-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),BIOL,http://culpa.info/professors/5567,silver,11.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Racaniello,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOL/W4310-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MTWR,20202BIOL4310W001,LECTURE

BLOK PS0101,"Understanding Blockchain, AI, and Machin","This course provides an overview of the world of blockchain, AI, and machine learning. We explore artificial intelligence and machine learning and seek to understand the philosophical and ethical issues, relationship with consciousness and self-awareness, the categories and applications of the different families of AI algorithms, and what challenges and opportunities lie in the future. We then open the hood and look inside blockchain to see what it is, how it has evolved, and where it is headed, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We examine how these technologies will impact the future of work. Students are encouraged to think about the impact of these technologies on society and how they might become leaders and shapers in these fields.
 
 Participants acquire an understanding and appreciation of these technologies so they can explore further on their own. The course is taught through a mix of instruction, discussion, and guest speakers.

CLEN GU4521,DEFINING LIFE,"(Lecture). In the period since 1965, fiction has become global in a new sense and with a new intensity. Comparison is built into it. Writers from different national traditions have been avidly reading each other, wherever they happen to come from, and they often resist ""national"" and regional labels altogether. If you ask the Somali writer Nuruddin Farah whether the precocious child of Maps was inspired by Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, he will answer (at least he did when I asked him) that he and Rushdie both were inspired by Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Grass's The Tin Drum. At the same time, the human experiences around which novelists organize their fiction are often themselves global, explicitly and powerfully but also mysteriously. Our critical language is in some ways just trying to catch up with innovative modes of storytelling that attempt to be responsible to the global scale of interconnectedness on which, as we only rarely manage to realize, we all live. This course will begin with the Sudanese classic Season of Migration to the North, a rewriting of Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" and will end with the British novelist Zadie Smith. In between we will discuss novels by Gabriel García Márquez, Marguerite Duras, Milan Kundera, W.G. Sebald, Roberto Bolaño, and others. Requirements: two short papers (6-8 pages) and a final for undergraduates; one longer paper (12-15 pages) and no final for graduate students.",Ala Alryyes,6:15pm,9:25pm,10697,Morningside,W4521-20202-001,LIT PHIL & HUMAN EXP,Summer Session (SUMM),CLEN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/W4521-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202CLEN4521W001,LECTURE

We will explore how these genres develop in the post-WWII context of the rise of postmodern identity politics. Our main questions: How do such “fantastic” fictions navigate between social engagement with reality and escapism from reality at the same time? What other versions of reality can we imagine when we play with literary form? This course will give students the vocabulary to engage with conversations on racial and ethnic difference, as well as 20th century American literary movements, through readings of canonical Asian American texts.

CLEN S3978,Forms of Autobiography,"This courses examines the rise and transformations of autobiographical literature, from its origins in philosophical inquiry and religious confession, to life-writing experiments in prose and verse, to the autofictions of contemporary writers like Maggie Nelson, Ben Lerner, and Rachel Cusk. Our guiding concern will be the human impulses to explore, invent, and reveal ourselves through writing. We are autobiographical creatures! The will to question, interpret, and represent our experience is central to what it means to think and to live. To this end, our survey of autobiographical writing will consider a number of topics that are fundamental to the humanities in its project of self-study and self-cultivation: the mysteries of interiority, personhood, and identity, and how the forces of gender, race, and class may bear on these conceptions; notions of privacy and publicity; the entanglements of individual and social life, and the relationship between personal and historical experience; exemplarity and its discontents; forms of truth and fiction; narrative, and the elements of storytelling; personal and literary autonomy. Questions we’ll ask along the way include: Just how well can we know ourselves? and how well might we really want to? What kind of knowledge is self-knowledge, and how does compare with other modes of wisdom? What liberties do autobiography and autofiction permit their authors? What specific constraints and moral responsibilities do they enjoin? Many of the texts we’ll study were and are highly controversial, so we’ll also think about the conditions of literary scandal, and the extent to which writing about one’s life, and the lives of others, always entails certain risks.",Daniel Braun,1:00pm,4:10pm,10396,Morningside,S3978-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),CLEN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/S3978-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,TR,20202CLEN3978S001,SEMINAR
CLEN UN3484,"Inventions of the Self: Autofiction, The","Inventions of the self is an interdisciplinary course that explores how three different disciplines — literary studies, psychoanalysis and neuroscience — understand the self to be a site of creative and inventive possibilities. The literary genre of autofiction forces us to reconsider our assumptions regarding the connections of creativity, truth, and authenticity, and to wonder whether it is possible to write the truth of our selves into existence. Intriguingly, a process much like autofictional writing also is at the heart of modern psychoanalytic technique — and research in neuroscience increasingly suggests that the human brain’s potential to morph and adapt might be instrumental to human mentation as we know it.

CLFR GU4020,Contemporary Migrations in the French &,"In this course we explore the social and political history of migration between France and Africa with particular emphasis on its representation in the arts, especially literature and film. We examine the political, economic and social forces that have underpinned migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political, social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with questions about the relationship between politics and art and between life experience and representation.      The sources examined in the course include novels and feature and documentary films as well as political and legal discourses and analyses grounded in anthropological, sociological, and philosophical methodologies. Combining empirical with theoretical approaches, we consider both the specific political, legal, social and economic contexts of contemporary migration and broader conceptual questions about the status of ‘immigrants,’ ‘migrants’ and ‘refugees’ as social and cultural figures and political actors. Taking the view that local dynamics have to be situated in broader regional/global frameworks and vice versa, we examine national framings of migration in countries including France, Morocco and Algeria as well as transnational and cross-regional dynamics.",Madeleine Dobie,9:00am,12:10pm,14051,Morningside,S4020-20202-001,Contemporary Migrations,Summer Session (SUMM),CLFR,http://culpa.info/professors/1358,silver,14.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLFR/S4020-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,Hybrid > 80%,,3,,TR,20202CLFR4020S001,SEMINAR

CLMS PS0100,Global Climate Change and Public Policy,"Climate change is one of the world’s most critical challenges, and though quite prominent in today’s news it remains a complex and multifaceted issue. What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?
 
 Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.
 
 Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).
 
 Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers. Students are expected and encouraged to participate in class discussions, raise questions, and contribute to small group exercises and presentations.",Michael Bennett,1:10pm,3:00pm,11005,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,Global Climate Change & P,Summer High School Program,CLMS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLMS/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202CLMS0100K001,LECTURE

COMO PS0100,Models of the Universe: A Mathematical A,"Did you ever wonder if the universe has a shape, and what it might be? In this course, participants learn how to think about the shape and internal structure of the cosmos from a mathematical perspective, culminating in an appreciation for various theoretical models of the universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds—structures that look one way up close but may look totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works—creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, exploring advanced concepts from topology and theoretical cosmology with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Course participants gain, in addition to exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",Joseph Quinn,3:10pm,5:00pm,12030,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,Models of the Universe: M,Summer High School Program,COMO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMO/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202COMO0100K001,LECTURE

As a consequence, the demand for expertise in AI and machine learning is growing rapidly. This course will enable students to take the first step toward building AI driven applications.  The course’s main topics are:  1. What machine learning, deep learning and AI are.
 2. When machine learning is the right tool for AI.
 3. How to select the right machine learning algorithm for your AI scenario.
 4. How to use Python libraries to build AI applications.
 5. How to use Automated Machine Learning and Python to build AI applications.
 Real-world AI use cases and applications.
 This course aims at teaching the most important concepts of the machine learning workflow that data scientists follow to build end-to-end data science solutions. We assume that students have basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus.  Students will gain exposure to the theory behind classification, regression, forecasting, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

CREA PS0102,Creative Writing Elective: Imaginative F,"Genre Fiction: 
Our aim is to explore and create immersive, exciting fiction that incorporates the unreal—from surreal, ghostly short stories to detailed epic fantasy novels.

DEBA PS0101,Contemporary Debates in American Law and,"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the “front lines” of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.
 
 The morning session is generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon session allows participants to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.
 
 By the end of the three weeks, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.
 
 Note: While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",,1:10pm,3:00pm,10822,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,Debates in Amer Law & Soc,Summer High School Program,DEBA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DEBA/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202DEBA0101N001,LECTURE

They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.
 
 For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.
 
 Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other’s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.

 This week-long class focuses on preparing the drawing portion of a fine art portfolio application for college submissions. As the week progresses, each student receives an in-depth critique from the instructor of their current work and of their plan for their portfolio. The course is focused on completing several large projects so as to showcase observational drawing skills, ranging from still life to architectural space to self-portraiture, as well as conceptual skills.
 
 The course combines video demonstrations of drawing techniques, individual conferences with the instructor as well as online group critiques, and virtual studio visits with professional artists. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week through group writing prompts and online discussion, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work. An online demonstration of how to professionally document and edit work in Photoshop for a digital application concludes the week.

ECON GU4301,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOPMNT I,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213. Economic development is a complex and multifaceted process. Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 /day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",Wendy A Morrison,1:00pm,4:10pm,12076,Morningside,G4301-20202-001,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOP,Summer Session (SUMM),ECON,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/G4301-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,"ECON UN3211

EIPD PS0201,Entrepreneurship & Innovation: New Produ,"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.
 
 With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University’s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.
 
 Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.
 
 Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another’s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",Michelle Greenwald,1:10pm,3:00pm,10853,Morningside,N0201-20202-001,NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - LEC,Summer High School Program,EIPD,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EIPD/N0201-20202-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202EIPD0201N001,LECTURE

Section 001 Enabling safer medical care in a world shaped by COVID-19: 
COVID-19 has changed our world. The last few months have demonstrated how dangerous it can be for healthcare workers to interact directly with patients. Also, the new inherent risks of accessing medical care at a healthcare facility present a new challenge for patients and their support network.  
Section 002 Reducing inequity in a world shaped by COVID-19:
 COVID has disproportionately affected different communities and has increased inequality. This includes inequality in employment, time, health care, risks, ability to communicate, education, loneliness, and connectivity. How can we reduce the rising inequality brought about by COVID?  
Section 003 Accelerating scaled vaccine production to meet a pandemic response: 
Elmer Gaden, “the father of bioprocess engineering,”  pioneered deep tank fermentation of mold for the industrial production of penicillin, ushering in the modern-day bioprocess industry, and providing broad access to antibiotics in WWII and beyond.  Today, we are faced with a similar scale-up and access challenge with respect to vaccines and pandemics.  In ordinary times, the production of and distribution of vaccines presents many technical and logistical challenges. Responding to worldwide pandemics such as COVID-19  with a vaccine presents additional complexity, not only concerning safety and efficacy vis a vis novelty and speed, but also with respect to access, manufacturability, and resources.   
Section 004 Mitigating Climate Change through Innovative Energy Storage Applications: 
The transition from humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels to renewables is key to climate change mitigation.  Energy storage is necessary to achieve such goals.  With the advent of electric vehicles, we can see the transition beginning.   You are tasked with developing a new application where energy storage will help revolutionize how humanity is powered.

ENGL S3261,ENGLISH LITERATURE TO 1500,"The earliest readers of Geoffrey Chaucer revered him as the “flower of eloquence” and a “noble rhetorician” for transforming the English vernacular into a language suitable for poetry. This praise became the basis for Chaucer’s contemporary fame as the “Father of English Poetry.” However, during Chaucer’s lifetime, his reputation was probably more political and social than poetic, given his posts as a London civil servant and diplomat, which reminds us to consider how history shaped his poetry. This course will examine Chaucer’s poems, including the 
Canterbury Tales
, in a biographical and local context, exploring how the changing class structure, social rebellions, and religious upheavals of fourteenth-century London might have shaped his thinking. Situating Chaucer’s poems alongside other historical, literary, and religious writings produced in England, such as 
Piers Plowman
, we will also see how his ideas reflect, rather than stand apart from, many of the preoccupations in late medieval literary culture: authority through authorship, dreams and the imagination, sexuality and the tradition of antifeminism, as well as hierarchies of power and religious identity. Our interdisciplinary approach will thus highlight the inventive ways in which not only Chaucer, but also his contemporaries, represented the controversial conversations of the time.",Gillian R Adler,1:00pm,4:10pm,10239,Morningside,S3261-20202-001,CHAUCER & LITERARY LONDON,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3261-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202ENGL3261S001,SEMINAR

ENGL S3273,THE POET OF THE BODY: NEW YORK'S WALT WH,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10045,Morningside,S3273-20202-001,THE POET OF THE BODY: NEW,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/77,silver,7.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3273-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,TR,20202ENGL3273S001,LECTURE

ENGL S3802,GEORGE ELIOT: ETHICS AND FICTION,"Author of Middlemarch, widely regarded as “the best English novel,” George Eliot was hailed by her successor Henry James as “one of the noblest, most beautiful minds of our time.” This course will engage Eliot not only as a consummate author of nineteenth-century realist fiction but also as an ethical philosopher. Her novels explore the questions, “How should one live?” “What is the right thing to do?” “What is one’s obligation to the other?” while rejecting moral didacticism. We will read four of Eliot’s masterpieces along with brief excerpts from her essays and from philosophers Spinoza, Feuerbach, J.S. Mill, Spencer, and G.H. Lewes, all of whom critically influenced Eliot’s thinking. For Eliot, the novel serves as a vehicle for ethical inquiry; without “lapsing from the picture to the diagram,” her rich narrative portrayal of character and social intercourse gives “flesh and blood” to philosophical dilemmas, bringing home to readers the real consequences of moral choice and action.

ENGL S3915,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"“Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.”― Michel de Montaigne “There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard, The Writing Life “Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,10047,Morningside,S3915-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/4531,silver,11.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3915-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202ENGL3915S001,SEMINAR

An examination of the different forms of staged comedy throughout the centuries, beginning with foundational texts from Ancient Greece, especially Aristophanes. We consider how today's playwrights are still building on, and making reference to, primary works from the Western canon. Texts we will read range from Shakespeare, Jonson and Restoration comedies, to Wilde, Beckett, Hansberry, Tennessee Williams, Pinter, and Churchill. We will also cover contemporary work seen on the stages of New York, including short comic plays, stand up, and physical comedy. Attention will be given to comic characters, comic pretense, wit, humor, comedy of errors, comic gestures, comic archetypes, farce, cross-dressing, satiric comedy, comic relief, tragicomedy, romantic comedy, and theatre of the absurd.

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion

For millennia, females spirituality and female sexuality have been paired in ways that reveal deep-seated anxieties about the female body and its power. From ancient goddess worship to the frenzied witch hunts of early modern Europe to the child-devouring crones of folk tales from cultures around the world, we’ll delve into what the witch and those who name and pursue her reveal about deeply-held cultural beliefs and anxieties. We’ll work together to analyze the archetype of the witch across time and space and develop our own ideas about why she is so constantly compelling. We’ll also look at our own sociocultural moment and connect what we learn about witches to the world around us.      Appropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",Wendy C Schor-Haim,,,00025,Barnard College,S0590-20202-001,WITCHES,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,http://culpa.info/professors/4531,silver,11.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGP/S0590-20202-001/,,,,0,,,20202ENGP0590S001,SEMINAR
ENID PS0101,Entrepreneurship: From Idea to Early Des,"This intensive ten-session course takes an applied, practical approach to the development, testing, and validation of customer or community-driven product solutions. By learning and applying contemporary design-thinking concepts and tools, students generate innovative solutions to important customer or community problems. During the program, students identify and define a major problem to be solved, work with real customers to better understand the problem from their perspective, generate multiple solutions, then choose a solution to test with real customers. Students acquire practical knowledge and tools focusing on the development, testing, and validation of new products that solve real customer problems and needs, from idea to early product development.
 
 Students can expect to learn how to:
 
 identify and articulate customer problems in an accurate way, reflecting how individuals truly experience the problem and its challenges
 create effective customer surveys to help validate your assumptions on customer problems (pain points), solutions, and benefits (expected outcomes)
 assess current solutions provided in the marketplace in order to build on best practices as well as identify gap areas
 develop a minimal viable product in order to gain additional feedback on specific solution features
 measure and validate customer needs fulfillment or social impact assumptions
 develop a solution (business or social enterprise) model to test your assumptions about customer interests, acceptance, and use",Jack McGourty,2:10pm,4:00pm,10826,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,ENTREPRENEURSHP:IDEA TO DESIGN,Summer High School Program,ENID,http://culpa.info/professors/1418,,67.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENID/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202ENID0101N001,LECTURE

ENIN PS0201,Entrepreneurship & Innovation: Changing,"Intended for students interested in creating new business ventures or social enterprises, this hands-on course focuses on the creation, evaluation, development, and launch-readiness of new business or social ventures. Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format. For each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.
 
 Students work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class, they refine their venture’s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership. By the end of the class, participants have generated robust business models, with supportive venture plan documents, investor pitches, websites, and crowd-funding videos.",Jack McGourty,1:10pm,3:00pm,10855,Morningside,N0201-20202-001,CHG THE WRLD VIA VENTUR C,Summer High School Program,ENIN,http://culpa.info/professors/1418,,67.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENIN/N0201-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202ENIN0201N001,LECTURE

ENLW PS0101,Law at the Cutting Edge of Technology,"This class explores the application of legal principles to advancements in technology, including social media, drones, video games, cryptocurrency, and smartphone apps. In learning about these particular topics, students gain a more general understanding of some of the most important concepts underlying much of U.S. law.
 
 We analyze the law of nuisance and trespass through the lens of Pokemon Go, and we look at the legal concept of negligence by examining product liability issues arising from injuries related to autonomous vehicles and SnapChat filters. The class then explores how the right to privacy is impacted in the physical world by drone technology, and how privacy interests are impacted in the digital world by data gathering platforms such as Facebook. We look at legal issues having to do with the future of money, gaining a basic understanding of blockchain and its role in cryptocurrency and fractional asset ownership through tokenization. Finally, through a study of “influencer” marketing, we explore advertising, marketing, and contract law through a case study of the infamous Fyre Festival.
 
 Students learn through a combination of lecture, discussion, debate, and group work. Content and learning examples are presented in various forms, including PowerPoints, short videos, images, in-class demonstrations, and a guest speaker. Students complete a culminating project involving an oral small group presentation.
 
 Through this immersive learning experience, participants gain a broad understanding of the law as well as enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills. They learn how to approach complex, dynamic legal problems and methodically analyze all relevant factors so as to arrive at logical, evidence-based results. Further, they practice collaborative co-creation and public speaking as they work in small groups on their culminating oral presentations.",Hilary Silvia,2:10pm,4:00pm,11014,Morningside,K0101-20202-001,Law: Cutting Edge of Tech,Summer High School Program,ENLW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENLW/K0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202ENLW0101K001,LECTURE

ETHI PS0201,Introduction to Philosophical Enquiry: E,"This course introduces students to normative ethical theory and applies these theories to several concrete moral issues
 
 Following an orientation in philosophical themes and methods, the course divides into two basic units – roughly, ‘theory’ and ‘practice.’ We first look at the conceptual or theoretical foundations of ethics, surveying four major approaches to ethics in Western philosophy: consequentialism, Kantian ethics, virtue ethics, and the ethics of care.
 
 With these tools in hand, we assess three contemporary moral problems: abortion, freedom of expression and ‘cancel culture,"" and inequality. We shall be concerned with questions such as: Is abortion morally permissible and, if so, under what conditions? What is freedom of expression, why do we value it, and to what extent should it be limited? What is ‘cancel culture,’ and to what extent is it, or could it be, morally good or bad? What are the various dimensions of the concept of moral equality? Is it immoral that some people are unequal with respect to resources such as wealth, income, education, and healthcare? In theorizing about justice, is a focus on individual distributive shares of such goods a distraction from practical realities of inequality in race, gender, etc?
 
 Readings are drawn from classical sources such as Aristotle, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Stuart Mill and contemporary philosophers including Peter Singer, Virginia Held, Judith Jarvis Thomson, John Rawls, Elizabeth Anderson, and Tommie Shelby.
 
 Through lecture, independent reading, and class discussion and debate, participants gain a familiarity with some of the fundamental issues in ethics, an understanding of the distinctiveness of philosophical enquiry, and an improved ability to think critically and to express themselves clearly and cogently.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10857,Morningside,N0201-20202-001,ETHICS,Summer High School Program,ETHI,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ETHI/N0201-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202ETHI0201N001,LECTURE
ETPH PS0100,The Ethics of Tech,"This course probes the evolving ethical, political, and social questions that have begun to emerge as a result of rapid technological transformations in the 21st Century.
 
 Students are introduced to selections of classical moral and political philosophy, which provides a critical vocabulary for discussing a broad range of concerns that have animated the emerging field of tech and ethics. We discuss issues associated with AI, algorithmic bias, data and privacy, free speech and content regulation, and antitrust claims against tech giants, among other topics.

FILM PS0100,Understanding Cinema: Analyzing Film Lan,"This course introduces students to the art and analysis of cinema through examination of works by filmmakers ranging from Orson Welles to Martin Scorsese. Readings, screenings, the analysis of clips and full-length movies, as well as hands-on exercises such as storyboarding, blocking, shooting, and editing a scene all combine to convey the excitement and artistry of film.
 
 Week One:
 
 Students learn how motion pictures developed their own language—their own, universally understood visual system of representation—by studying the masters of early and contemporary cinema: the edge-of-your-seat last minute rescue scenes of D.W. Griffith; the bravura long takes of Jean Renoir; the nail-biting tension created by Quentin Tarantino; and the nerve-tingling suspense that is the hallmark of Alfred Hitchcock. Beginning with a storyboard, students will try their hand at conceptualizing a scene from start to finish in the style of classical Hollywood cinema.
 
 Week Two:
 
 Having learned Hollywood’s tricks of the trade, we branch out into international cinema, where other nations developed different systems of representation—their own languages—that challenged but also inspired the American film industry. Meet the Soviet style of filmmaking that revolutionized cinema in every sense of the word; the Gothic excess of German Expressionism, whose use of lighting, setting, and costume echoes in all contemporary horror flicks; and the bold surrealism of Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dali, and Maya Deren, whose cinematic experiments impact on dream sequences to the present day. Each student writes a review of one contemporary American film that owes a debt to foreign cinema—or vice versa.
 
 Week Three:
 
 Putting it all together, Week Three culminates in group analyses of some of the masterworks of classical and contemporary cinema such as Citizen Kane, Run, Lola, Run and La La Land. We examine and discuss the ways in which sound and image, editing, and the elements of mise-en-scène combine to create transporting cinematic experiences that have the ability to make audiences cry, experience fear, feel empathy and joy and, above all, marvel at the magic of movies.
 
 Daily readings include film reviews and essays on film analysis, technique and history. Students are also responsible for an oral presentation on a specific scene, film, or director of their choice.

FILM S0431,TELEVISION WRITING INTENSIVE,"Prerequisites: Apply directly to the School of the Arts. Access the application here: 
https://arts.columbia.edu/summer/film/course/television-writing-intensive
 . International students and domestic students seeking credit should register for FILM S3040D. This is the same course, but it does not provide academic credit. The TV Writing Intensive is a six-week, concentrated and encompassing introduction into the field of television writing designed to prepare students to join the professional worlds of half-hour comedies and one-hour dramas across network, cable and digital platforms. In an interconnected program consisting of two intensive writing workshops and a lecture series with guest writers and producers, students gain the knowledge and authority to explore, examine and create the kind of groundbreaking work that is taking over television here and around the world. Participants in The Television Writing Intensive learn about half-hour comedy and one-hour drama by writing and developing spec scripts and original pilots. A spec script is a teleplay for an existing show where the writer brings original stories to existing characters. A pilot is a script written for an original series that the writer creates.

FILM S4215,CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL DOCUMENTAR,"Documentaries are increasingly proliferating across small and large screens around the world. They circulate as market commodities, forms of entertainment, and vehicles for social change. In this seminar we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary production, including projects created within the media industries of Mexico, Peru, India, China, Cambodia, and Israel. We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda.

How is the price of a company’s stock determined and how does it affect individual investors? This challenging course introduces the basic financial principles necessary to understand the role of the stock market in our economy and in our personal lives.
 
 Class time is divided between lecture and lab. Participants assume the role of money managers in order to gain an understanding of financial markets as they manage their own portfolio of stocks in a session-long stock market simulation game.

 Architecture and Society: New York’s Built Environment
 This course introduces students to the visual analysis of architecture. Instead of surveying the history of architecture, we look at specific New York landmarks so as to understand how great structures not only fulfill practical needs but also influence our relationship to the physical and social world around us. By studying some of the city's notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. Students become familiar with basic architectural vocabulary (such as light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same elements to different ends.
 
 We examine historical and current images of key buildings and places, discuss their essential role in urban life, and identify significant events which have made them memorable. We also consider how their portrayal in popular culture has contributed to New York’s identity and image as an American city and a global destination.
 
 Some of the sites we consider typically include Columbia University’s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9/11 Memorial.",Nenette Arroyo,1:10pm,3:00pm,11971,Morningside,N0205-20202-001,ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIETY,Summer High School Program,FOVA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FOVA/N0205-20202-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202FOVA0205N001,LECTURE

We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City.

GERM S1115,ACCELERATED ELEM READING I/II,"Prerequisites: no previous knowledge of German required, but some background is strongly recommended. This accelerated survey of German grammar, reading techniques, and dictionary skills is designed primarily for graduate students preparing for reading proficiency exams or wishing to do research in German-language literature. In addition to translation, the course focuses on strategies for extracting general and specific information from German texts (skimming and scanning) and judging their relevance for a specific research purpose. Reading texts take students' fields of study into consideration. Although this course does not satisfy any part of the foreign language requirement for degree candidates, successful completion of the translation on the final exam fulfills the German reading proficiency requirement in most graduate programs. Students are advised that this course is a full-time commitment. Students should expect to study 2 hours every day for every hour spent in the classroom and additional time on weekends.

GERM S1115,ACCELERATED ELEM READING I/II,"Prerequisites: no previous knowledge of German required, but some background is strongly recommended. This accelerated survey of German grammar, reading techniques, and dictionary skills is designed primarily for graduate students preparing for reading proficiency exams or wishing to do research in German-language literature. In addition to translation, the course focuses on strategies for extracting general and specific information from German texts (skimming and scanning) and judging their relevance for a specific research purpose. Reading texts take students' fields of study into consideration. Although this course does not satisfy any part of the foreign language requirement for degree candidates, successful completion of the translation on the final exam fulfills the German reading proficiency requirement in most graduate programs. Students are advised that this course is a full-time commitment. Students should expect to study 2 hours every day for every hour spent in the classroom and additional time on weekends.

It places particular emphasis on the themes of the polis, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces—complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages—and ask: To what extent is meaning and cultural identity, site-specific? How central is the classical past in Western imagination? How have great metropolises such as Paris, Istanbul, and New York fashioned themselves in response to the allure of the classical and the advent of modern Greece?

HIST GU8914,"Development, Sustainability, and Inequal","This course will explore how the idea of development took shape from the Enlightenment to the present. We will discuss how economic development was initially seen through the lenses of moral philosophy as a civilizing process but was also destined for exhaustion because of the limits of nature and the finite endowment of land. We will examine how the Industrial Revolution marked a major shift in perspective and turned capitalism and economic growth into virtually unbounded processes. A major focus of the course will be on the Twentieth Century. We will explore how the development discourse has been transformed in a global context by different actors, and how it has intersected with other issues such as inequality, environmentalism, war and security, and social dynamics such as the role of women. We will discuss the peculiarities of specific periods and approaches, but we will also learn to recognize the recurrent themes and debates that are still lively today.",Michele Alacevich,9:00am,12:10pm,14077,Morningside,G8914-20202-002,"Dev, Sust & Ineq.A Global",Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/G8914-20202-002/,ONLINE CLAS,On-Line Only,,4,,MW,20202HIST8914G002,COLLOQUIA

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"Even before the U.S. existed as a republic, people from 'Hispanic' and Indo-America have been incorporated into the culture, history, life, and occupational fabric of the United States. Yet, forces, figures, and factions in larger society frequently perceived Latin American heritage people as members of an 'alien' culture. Through histories of coercion, migration, labor recruitment, family networks, religious conversion, wars of occupation, economic need, political exile, education inequities, electoral participation, and unimaginative representations in film, fiction, and broader popular culture, millions of people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, and the rest of Latin America have somehow become American, while still remaining outside the national community. This 3-point undergraduate lecture course will examine the process of departure and arrival-the historical forces pushing and pulling people from Latin America to the United States. We will also examine how 'Spanish,' 'Latins,' 'Hispanics,' and 'Latinos' adjust, integrate, assimilate, resist, and adapt to the many forces that affect their lives in the U.S. over the last century and a half, creating new ethnic, racial and local identities in the process. By studying the experience of Latinos/as and Latin American immigrants with an eye toward patterns of second-class citizenship, identity formation, ethnic culture, community maturation, labor struggles, and social mobility, we will map out the heterogeneous mosaic of Latin American and Caribbean diasporas in the U.S. Due in large part to ongoing immigration from Mexico, the Mexican-origin population has grown appreciably from approximately 100,000 at the turn of the twentieth century to thirty-five million today (10% of the overall U.S. population and about 65% of the collective Latino community). We shall therefore pay special attention to what ethnic Mexicans, their offspring, and other Americans have had to say about the Mexican American experience and its effects on Latino/a social life as well as the nation's economy, society, and culture. Naturally, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Central/South American communities in the United States will be examined as well. The study of Latino history is a young discipline, with many gaps and grey areas. It also exists in a complex and tense dialogue (often a monologue) within broader U.S. history.

The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings.

The current crisis provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter Movement have made this question even more urgent.

Working from the notion that sport is “more than a game,” the class will examine the social, economic, cultural, and political impact of sports in distinct hemispheric American contexts from the late 19th century until the present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the course encourages students to examine sports in other local, national, and transnational settings. During the summer session we will focus on three themes that exemplify the ways the sporting realm illuminates some of the pressing problems of our time: the conflicts engendered by the staging of mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup; the impact of sports on the implementation of Title IX, and understandings of gender and sexuality; and football’s impact on the evolution of masculine identities in the U.S. Course materials include works by historians, sociologists, social theorists, and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies.",Frank Guridy,10:15am,1:00pm,14306,Morningside,W2587-20202-001,SPORT&SOCIETY IN THE AMER,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/13328,,2.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Andre_Guridy,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/W2587-20202-001/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20202HIST2587W001,LECTURE

Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images.

And yet, according to the UN Secretary-General’s (SG) annual report on children and armed conflict last year armed conflicts around the world led to at least 4,000 verified rights violations against children committed by government forces and over 11,500 by non-state militant groups. The violations include killing or maiming, recruitment or use of children in hostilities, sexual violence, using children as human bombs, abductions, the denial of humanitarian access, and attacks on schools and hospitals. About 50 percent of the estimated 26 million people currently displaced by armed conflicts and violence are children.

HUMN PS0101,Human Rights in the 21st Century: Challe,"Are human rights still relevant in promoting social justice and freedom in the 21st Century? Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II. However, recent rises in authoritarianism and anti-liberal regimes have raised new questions on whether the human rights framework is still capable of addressing injustices in the modern world. This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.
 
 In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.
 
 In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.
 
 Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities. The primary assignment for this course is participation in an international moot court activity, which challenges students to research and give oral arguments on a fictitious human rights case.
 
 The course also introduces students to several different perspectives through a variety of guest lecturers.",,1:10pm,3:00pm,10871,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,Human Rights,Summer High School Program,HUMN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HUMN/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202HUMN0101N001,LECTURE

IDRA PS0201,Drawing: Eye & Idea,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
 
 In this online beginner-level class, students explore various modes of looking at and interpreting the world through drawing. The course emphasizes drawing from both observation and imagination as ways to learn traditional and digital drawing techniques and foster creativity and personal interpretation. Course assignments develop the use of traditional drawing materials alongside conceptual prompts to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition and experiments with scale, the development of personal narrative and subject matter, and the use of charcoal as well as animated digital tools, all with personalized attention from the instructor.
 
 The course combines demonstrations of drawing techniques, individual conferences with the instructor as well as online group critiques, and virtual studio visits with professional artists. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week through group writing prompts and online discussion, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.
 
 Participants learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications and are instructed on how to professionally document and present their work. The session concludes with a final drawing project, in which the students work on animating and editing as a group. A final blog will house a virtual exhibit, and work is shared within the community on a social media platform.",Ioana I Manolache,1:10pm,4:00pm,11026,Morningside,N0201-20202-002,DRAWING: EYE & IDEA,Summer High School Program,IDRA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IDRA/N0201-20202-002/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202IDRA0201N002,LABORATORY
IENT PS0101,Introduction to Entrepreneurship & Innov,"This course is intended for students interested in learning the fundamentals of the innovation and development process that gives rise to ventures in both the commercial and social worlds. Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today’s venture success stories.
 
 Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching “shark tank” style in front of a group of experts.
 
 Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.
 
 Upon successful completion of the course, participants will have created fully realizable business models. They will have also honed key professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.",Michelle Greenwald,3:10pm,5:00pm,10873,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNO,Summer High School Program,IENT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IENT/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202IENT0101N001,LECTURE

IFLM PS0101,Filmmaking with iPhone & iPad,"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker’s Sundance feature film, Tangerine, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary, Searching for Sugar Man, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.
 
 Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.
 
 In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, and/or sound – so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.
 
 In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools/career paths
 
 On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications..
 
 Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",Yu Cheng,2:10pm,4:00pm,10828,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,Film Making with Iphone,Summer High School Program,IFLM,http://culpa.info/professors/13211,,1.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IFLM/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202IFLM0101N001,LECTURE

IMGT PS0100,Insurance as a Financial Tool and a Sour,"When we are confronted by global pandemics, climate change, and cyber-attacks, the insurance industry is the good guy who comes to the rescue. And when it comes to new opportunities such as bitcoin, driverless vehicles, and artificial intelligence, here too insurance plays a key role in enabling innovation and supporting growth and prosperity.  In this course we examine the inner workings of one of the most valuable financial services for society. The first insurance policy was written 670 years ago. Today, the ten largest insurers in the world generate over $918 billion in net written premium and hold $7 trillion in non-banking assets. Course participants gain a deep appreciation as to why individuals and businesses rely on insurance as a powerful financial tool, and come to understand the value that insurance provides to society.  Through lectures, role play, case studies, and group projects, students come to understand:  
  
How insurance is responding to modern threats such as climate change, cyber-attack, coronavirus, and natural disasters.
  
How insurance is evolving to accommodate driverless vehicles, bitcoin, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotization, 5G, aging populations, and longer life spans.
  
Why insurance is a financial necessity in a global economy.
  
How to utilize insurance as a financial tool.
  
How insurance companies make money and balance it with paying claims.
  
How risks are monetized and transferred. 
  
How insurance helps to stimulate economic growth.
  
The economic advantages of pooling exposures.
  
How insurance has evolved over time.

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like?

INCR PS0150,"Conflict Resolution: Negotiation, Persua","Conflict is a part of life. Most people do not like conflict because they usually do not resolve their conflicts well and so they develop a distaste for it. There are also ways to constructively engage in conflict that lead to better quality outcomes and relationships. In this course, students learn basic concepts about conflict resolution so that they can develop a deeper and broader understanding of conflict dynamics. There are many types of conflicts and in this course the students focus on learning more about their interpersonal conflicts with others. They learn skills so they will be able to more constructively resolve their interpersonal conflicts toward win-win outcomes.
 
 These goals are achieved by students developing more self-awareness as to the types of conflict styles they tend to use as their “default” approach. They become more aware of their “hot buttons” and the types of behaviors and situations that cause them to become embroiled in a conflict situation. In addition to learning more about their own habits, they apply these concepts and skills to better understand others around them. By developing more empathy and understanding of others, students are able to reduce the number, types, and intensity of their interpersonal conflicts.
 
 The course is primarily experiential and interactive so students learn by doing and reinforce their learning through immediate application. There are role-plays, simulations, discussions, presentations, film analyses, and other activities designed to enhance learning of the identified concepts and skills.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,10876,Morningside,N0150-20202-001,CONFLICT RESOLUTION,Summer High School Program,INCR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INCR/N0150-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202INCR0150N001,LECTURE
INDI PS0101,Introduction to Digital Filmmaking,"In this beginner-level course, participants use their personal cameras (either iPhones, iPads, or DSLR’s) to create strong, visually-driven short films and video exercises with an emphasis on the foundations of narrative storytelling. They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.
 
 Students begin by learning the elements of digital filmmaking with video exercises that start off simply at first, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment until they advance to a final film project.
 
 For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts.
 
 Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other’s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.
 
 The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",Yu Cheng,3:10pm,5:00pm,11961,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,"DIGITAL FILMMAKING, INTRO",Summer High School Program,INDI,http://culpa.info/professors/13211,,1.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INDI/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202INDI0101N001,LECTURE

The combination of subjects and methods enables participants to experience math in a way high schools are often unable to present it, approaching problems as open-ended opportunities for creativity, independent thinking, and intellectual excitement.
 
 The course is divided into three units:
 
 Logic: An exploration of logic builds the groundwork for further mathematical reasoning. What is mathematical logic? How does one structure a proof? How can this framework be applied to philosophical thought? One topic covered is game theory (how mathematicians study decision-making), which has applications in fields such as economics, biology, and psychology.
 Counting and Probability: Abstract counting, in the form of combinatorics, serves as an introduction to set theory, which in turn sets the stage for probability theory. As an application, the class delves into cryptography, looking at how math can be used to create and read secret messages.
 Advanced Topics: In the final week, building on what we have done already and depending one students’ interests, we look at a few advanced topics. Potential topics include planetary orbits, symmetry, topology, common statistical fallacies, and Markov chains.
 After exploring these various applications of mathematics, participants select and complete a group project based upon their own interests within the field.

KNOW PS0101,"Knowledge, Reality, and Truth","Is it possible that how things “really” or “truly” are is very different from how they appear to us? Could it be, for example, that the “real world” in which we believe ourselves to live is actually a computer program, á la The Matrix? If not, then how can we know that this is not the case – what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge – what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference – would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways – if we actually are living in the Matrix?
 
 In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato’s Republic and René Descartes’ Meditations, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.
 
 This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students’ abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.
 
 Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",Alexander C Rigas,2:10pm,4:00pm,10832,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,"Knowledge, Reality, and T",Summer High School Program,KNOW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/KNOW/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202KNOW0101N001,LECTURE

Whether a lawyer or a layperson, there is opportunity for individuals to engage in advocacy, whether on behalf of a single battered woman or in support of displaced refugees. In this course, which focuses primarily on the legal system in the United States, we:
 
 Survey the fundamentals of substantive law, such as criminal law, constitutional law, property law, contract law, and torts.
 Explore legal procedure as a means to enhance – or frustrate – justice.
 Look closely at successful litigation and political movements as means of bringing about social change.
 Meet legal practitioners in a variety of advocacy areas who share how they use the law to achieve the ends of justice.
 Case studies are drawn from areas such as civil rights, environmental protection, criminal justice, immigration policy, disabilities law, international human rights, family law, and animal rights.
 
 Participants should be willing to dedicate several hours per week on case law readings, drafting of briefs, and related debate and mock trial/moot court related tasks.
 
 At the conclusion of the course, students, working in groups, produce strategic advocacy projects for addressing issues of interest to them from among the subjects addressed in the course.

LELA PS0212,Exploring Careers in Law,"In this course designed for students considering careers in law, participants acquire a realistic understanding of the legal profession and of the steps and skills necessary for success within it. In the process, they gain insight into whether a career in law would be fulfilling to them.
 
 At the heart of the course is exposure to the real world of legal practice. Through substantive instruction related to first-year law school courses, LSAT test prep information, and information about licensing requirements, students develop an appreciation of what is required to ‘get in, get through and get out’ of an American law school.
 
 Presentations by attorneys representing a range of practice areas impart a “real world” perspective about law as it is practiced in the corporate, government, and non-profit sectors.
 
 Participants engage in fundamental legal research and writing assignments. They participate in debates and mock trial and moot court related tasks, enhancing public speaking skills. These various exercises are intended to provide each student with a collection of transferrable skills, helping to make them more “marketable” as they move toward college and career.

LING PS0100,Exploring Topics in Linguistics,"This course examines five intriguing areas of linguistics that relate to crucial 21st Century social issues. Starting with fossils and skulls, we explore where language came from, how it evolved, and how it differs from animal communication. Next, we look at language variation (in the form of accents, dialect, and slang) and imposed linguistic policies (such as spelling) that manipulate our native abilities to communicate. We move onto pragmatics, the study of how language use varies based on context, audience, formality, speaker intentionality, and even gender identity. Next, we explore language taboos (curse words, censorship) and language prestige (the social value placed on different speaking styles). We finish with an analysis of the Internet's impact on language (memes, texting, the possible decline of ""proper"" English, and the limitations of AI communication).
 
 Students work in the morning with texts, lectures, and films, covering the principles of linguistics and the relevant literature. In the afternoon, they problem-solve by working through case studies and analyzing linguistic evidence via databases and other web resources. Guest speakers who are active in their fields add a level of detail and specificity to the course.
 
 Participants gain a deeper understanding of the role of language in their society and linguistics as an interdisciplinary tool for greater insight into how we live.",Susan Behrens,2:10pm,4:00pm,11016,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,Exploring Topics in Lingu,Summer High School Program,LING,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LING/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202LING0100K001,LECTURE
LRRW PS0213,Legal Reasoning: Thinking Like a Lawyer,"This course focuses on reading case law and interpreting the underlying laws, the research and reasoning that underlie solid legal arguments, and legal writing, while also giving students an inside look at the practice of law today. The course is structured like a traditional introductory first-year law school class.
 
 Students learn first to use the methods and tools of legal reasoning and research, which they marshal to create effective, persuasive, and sophisticated written legal arguments. Once they have a foundation in legal research, reasoning, and writing, they are given an in-depth look at various types of law through interactive sessions with practicing lawyers, via guest speakers and field trips to law firms. They learn about the trial process and the inner workings of the court system by taking a tour of a New York City court and viewing a criminal trial. They learn how to problem solve using the lawyer’s toolbox and how to analyze legal sources and develop legal arguments based on and supported by the law and cases we research.
 
 In-class drafting and public speaking exercises strengthen participants’ reasoning, argumentation, and writing skills while introducing them to various types of legal work, including written memoranda and arguments for oral delivery. Students work in class on preparing legal memoranda of law on specified topics. After the final draft, they pair up to argue against each other in a formal court oral argument setting.",Jacques Erdos,1:10pm,3:00pm,10965,Morningside,N0213-20202-001,"LEGAL REASONING,RES & WRI",Summer High School Program,LRRW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LRRW/N0213-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202LRRW0213N001,LECTURE
MARW PS0101,Thinking and Problem Solving: Math in th,"In this course intended for students who enjoy mathematics and logical reasoning, participants explore innovative ways in which math is used in the real world, in fields such as economics, computer science, media, and the physical sciences. By engaging with challenging practical problems, students hone their independent thinking and problem-solving skills.
 
 Areas covered include the following:
 
 Graph theory, a topic heavily developed by both mathematicians and computer scientists. We explore algorithmic ways to compute, for example, the optimal path between two points on a map (minimizing cost, time, or another parameter). Another application is minimizing the cost of an electrical network which has to provide power to all residents in a new neighborhood.
 Probability and its numerous applications. We look at how probabilities are applied in economics and in popular media, and examine how they can sometimes be counter-intuitive or even deceptive.
 Various counting methods, combinatorics, and examples of Nash equilibria. We study applications of these techniques in economics (the prisoner's dilemma), computer science (assessing the complexity of an algorithm), finance (loans and investments), and biology (population growth).
 Students work individually and in groups to find creative solutions to given problems. Each student also works on a project of his or her own choosing, on a topic about which he or she is passionate.",Evan Toler,3:10pm,5:00pm,10966,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,MATH IN THE REAL WORLD,Summer High School Program,MARW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MARW/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202MARW0101N001,LECTURE

What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing “weaponization” of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America’s system of democratic government.
 
 Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.
 
 The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10968,Morningside,N0104-20202-001,THE MEDIA & POLITICS,Summer High School Program,MEPO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MEPO/N0104-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202MEPO0104N001,LECTURE
MGLO PS0101,The Media and Politics in Global Perspec,"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.
 
 We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.
 
 Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10969,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,THE MEDIA AND POLITICS: G,Summer High School Program,MGLO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MGLO/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202MGLO0101N001,LECTURE

NANO PS0226,Introduction to Material Science & Nanot,"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials—the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today’s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches and recovers, nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens, makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications.
 
 This challenging course is designed for students who want to deepen their understanding of the relationship between the nano- and microstructure of a material and its bulk physical and chemical properties.
 
 The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a morning online discussion about specific materials, including animations and thematic videos, and culminating with afternoon online research presentations by faculty from Columbia University, sister academic institutions, industry, and National Laboratories.
 
 Through individual and collaborative audio-visual assignments and class discussions, students learn to:
 
 Differentiate between metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials
 Search academic and professional journals and properly cite scientific work
 Perform effectively in a group setting by actively participating in discussions

NATU PS0101,"Natural Resources, Global Markets,  and","How has the US–China trade war affected the growth of world economies? Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?
 
 This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.
 
 Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers – i.e. export (supply/origin) and import (demand/destination) hubs – along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.
 
 Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources – including those that are sustainable – and their effect in the global landscape.
 
 Students gain an understanding of – and think critically about – various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,10834,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,"NTRL RSRCES,GLBL MKTS,IMP",Summer High School Program,NATU,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NATU/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202NATU0101N001,LECTURE

NESC PS0100,Neuroscience of Psychiatric Disorders,"Neuroscience is the study of the neural processes and mechanisms underlying human function and behavior. It is an interdisciplinary field that combines the ideas explored in the field of psychology with the science that governs the brain and body. In order to understand the etiology of disorders such as addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia, it is crucial to understand how molecular, cellular, and endocrine changes contribute to disease progression.

NSCI PS0100,Neuroscience and the Law,"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.
 
 The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.
 
 Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?

NYCS PS0215,New York Experienced: An Urban Case Stud,"This immersive course designed for students interested in New York City’s urban environment, culture, literature, history, and public policy comprises six interconnected modules:
 
 New York City: A History of People, Politics, and Place
 What is New York City’s relationship to the American Dream? How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the rest of the course. We also examine how human biological and neuroscientific development play a crucial role in the development of the city. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.
 
 Writing the City
 How is our understanding of New York – its projected image and self-image – shaped by literature about the city? How does the culture of the city exist outside of its boundaries? How has the city’s history shaped popular culture? Using short stories, poems, popular songs, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon.
 
 NYC Systems and Community
 The city exists as a series of overlapping systems; transportation, businesses, living areas, even cell phone towers and sewers all exist in close proximity, and often in tension with each other. It is a vibrant ecosystem: people, pets, rodents, pigeons, bacteria, and viruses competing for resources in close quarters. It has also been a place in which humans have encountered and conquered a significant number of biological challenges. Using systems thinking, students examine the community of New York as an ecosystem with a rich and ancient evolutionary past.
 
 How do we exist in concert or tension with so many competing interests? The answer here defines our community - what we value and what we don’t. How do we evaluate what, or who, is valued in our community? How do our brains frame the way we interact with our community? This overview takes into account an evolutionary lens when diving into historical and contemporary examples of how the communities in New York have worked together or experienced tension.
 
 Urban Place Design
 What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city?

PENQ PS0201,"Intro to Philosophical Enquiry: Love, Hu","This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.
 
 We begin by reading and discussing Plato's Symposium and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom—a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia?
 
 Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of existential freedom found in Being and Nothingness and Soren Kierkegaard’s religious freedom from Fear and Trembling, which Donald Palmer introduces in Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work The Myth of Sisyphus. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.
 
 In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",Alec U Milton,3:10pm,5:00pm,10981,Morningside,N0201-20202-001,INTRO TO PHIL:LOVE/HUM EX,Summer High School Program,PENQ,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PENQ/N0201-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202PENQ0201N001,LECTURE

PHMN PS0100,"Minds, Brains, and the Nature of Conscio","How is the mind related to the brain? Are sensations, beliefs, and desires immaterial or physical states? What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?
 
 We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.
 
 Course readings include such influential works as René Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's ""Sensations and Brain Processes,” Hilary Putnam’s “The Nature of Mental States,” and Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.
 
 The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students’ analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",Jared Peterson,2:10pm,4:00pm,11017,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,Intro to Philosophy of Mi,Summer High School Program,PHMN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHMN/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202PHMN0100K001,LECTURE
PHTG PS0220,Photography: The Camera Craft,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
 
 In this course students gain a hands-on understanding of the basic principles of digital photography, approaching it within the context of the fine arts.
 
 Using their own DSLR cameras, participants work on assignments and self-directed projects which touch on a diverse range of approaches to photography, with the goal of creating a final portfolio for web presentation at the course's conclusion. The course takes the form of both a seminar and a lab, and participants work on both individual and collaborative projects.
 
 We focus on the critical context of photography and its broad conceptual applications. Critical issues in art are addressed in the form of short seminars designed to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.
 
 Upon conclusion of the course, students will have completed a web-based portfolio to showcase their new bodies of work.

We will recognize that the deepest understanding of reality emerges from blending all of the accounts we discuss—from the reductionist to the humanist to the cosmological—and only through such amalgamation can we fully grasp the long-standing human search for meaning.",Brian Greene,6:15pm,9:25pm,14045,Morningside,W1111-20202-AS1,,School of Professional Studies (SPS),PHYS,http://culpa.info/professors/2897,silver,8.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHYS/W1111-20202-AS1/,To be announced,In-Person,,0,,TR,20202PHYS1111WAS1,SEMINAR

PPEC PS0100,Political and Economic Ideologies of the,"This course explores the central political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world, including capitalism, socialism, communism, liberalism, populism, and nationalism. We ask what principles define these ideologies, how these ideologies intersect with democracy, and how they produce and require different meanings and understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship.  Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.  By the end of the three weeks, students are equipped with not only a deeper understanding of the competing political and economic ideologies that shape the modern world, but also with the tools to make, understand, and critically evaluate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their future studies and as future citizens and leaders.",Geoffrey C Upton,1:10pm,3:00pm,11009,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,Political & Economic Ideo,Summer High School Program,PPEC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PPEC/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202PPEC0100K001,LECTURE

PTEC PS0101,Physics and Technologies of the Future,"In this course, intended for students who have an interest in science and technology but have not yet taken physics, participants are introduced to key concepts in the field and look at how these concepts are changing the world.
 
 Topics covered include electromagnetics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, newtonian mechanics, waves, stars and galaxies, nuclear physics, Einstein’s theory of relativity, and string theory. Having gained some understanding of these concepts, students explore new technologies in areas such as brain computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, gene sequence analysis, renewable energy, virtual reality, and biotechnology.
 
 Participants explore virtual experiments so as to understand reflection and refraction, write code for object recognition, and work with MATLAB (a software used by scientists and engineers) to create simulated models. They gain insights into best research practices and learn to peer-review science articles. They also work in groups on projects that they present at the end of the course.
 
 For this course, augmented reality pioneer, Amir Baradaran is working with the instructor to develop an augmented reality application, My DigiLab, which will be accessible to students for the duration of the program. The platform is a multi-user pedagogical software, accessible through Android and iOS smartphones, that immerses students into a digitally created interactive scientific laboratory that simulates hands-on and real-time learning experiments.

QMSS S5073,MACHINE LEARNING SOC SCI,"Prerequisites: basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra, and calculus This course will provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning as it is applied in a number of domains. Comparisons and contrasts will be drawn between this machine learning approach and more traditional regression-based approaches used in the social sciences. Emphasis will also be placed on opportunities to synthesize these two approaches. The course will start with an introduction to Python, the scikit-learn package and GitHub. After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python. Previous programming experience will be helpful but not requisite.

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ). The class ends by examining the efforts of American and European Muslim communities to carve out distinct spheres of identity in the larger global Muslim community ( umma) through expressions of popular culture (e.g. Hip-Hop).",Najam I Haider,1:00pm,4:30pm,10168,Morningside,S2305-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/10466,gold,8.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/S2305-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,4,,MW,20202RELI2305S001,LECTURE

RELI S4619,Islam in Popular Culture,"This course interrogates seminal issues in the academic study of Islam through its popular representation in various forms of media from movies and television to novels and comic books. The class is structured around key theoretical readings from a range of academic disciplines ranging from art history and anthropology to comparative literature and religion.  The course begins by placing the controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in historical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination of modern portrayals of Muslims in film that highlights both the vilification of the “other” (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial discourses centered on the “native informant” (Mamdani). Particular emphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these simplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits Muhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to understand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then examined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on the problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod). The course ends with a look at the unique history of Islam in America, particularly the tension between immigrant and African-American communities.",Najam I Haider,1:00pm,4:30pm,10654,Morningside,W4619-20202-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/10466,gold,8.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/W4619-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,4,,TR,20202RELI4619W001,SEMINAR

SNET PS0100,The Networked Self: Identity in the Digi,"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.
 
 Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the “commodified self” and “self-branding.” 2) “Digital surveillance” and the “managed self.” 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically “marginalized” identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.
 
 The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",Timothy Novak,2:10pm,4:00pm,11020,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,The Networked Self: Ident,Summer High School Program,SNET,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SNET/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202SNET0100K001,LECTURE

SPAN S2103,INTERMED SPAN II - MEDICAL,"Prerequisites: SPAN UN2101 or a score of 380-449 on the Department's placement examination. An intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. Prerequisite: SPAN UN 2101 or equivalent (as designated by the Department’s Placement Examination). In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. *This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences –including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

SPRT O5250,EMERGING AND NICHE SPORTS LEAGUES,"The creation and maintenance of sports leagues is a nuanced and complex endeavor. This course examines the format, hierarchy, membership, governance, and operational efficiencies of several sports leagues that have been launched with varying levels of success. Through a combination of lectures, case studies and guest speakers, students will learn about the ideation, funding, legal aspects, marketing, media strategy and monetization of these businesses, both domestically and globally. Students will gather data about emerging sports leagues of the past and present and conduct research on the leagues of their choice. The culminating project in this course will be an original proposal by student groups of a new sports league, addressing all of the aforementioned dimensions in a formal presentation to potential ‘investors.’ Students will present their proposal via online video conference for instructor feedback following the block week. This course is ideal for students who have an interest in the structural and operational decisions that affect the success and sustainability of sports leagues and their members.

SREL PS0101,Explorations in Physics: Special Relativ,"This course offers an intensive exploration of one of the fundamental principle of physics –relativity. Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.
 
 Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein’s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe. In addition, students take part in developing a computer game simulating relativistic effects of high-speed intergalactic travel.

STEM PS0100,MATLAB: Computer Modeling for Science an,"The course introduces students to programming in MATLAB, a software used by engineers and scientists for creating experiments, collecting data, analyzing the data, and simulating models. While learning how to use the software, students are also introduced to several broad concepts in science and technology, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, signal processing, electrical circuit models, biological models, and mechanical models. Participants learn to apply these concepts by writing code and building models in MATLAB.  In the process of building those models, students learn how to legitimately carry on scientific inquiry. They apply this learning to create their own experimental paradigms in MATLAB. They formulate scientific questions and design hypotheses to test those questions. To test the hypotheses, they create experiments and collect the necessary data by building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with MATLAB. They further analyze data from the experiments using the MATLAB software and form conclusions regarding their scientific inquiry.  Students also visit science and engineering labs at Columbia University and are introduced to the process of journal publication.  
Participants are required to bring their own laptops, either Windows or Mac-based, for this course. Laptops should have at least 4Gb of RAM memory. Instructions on how to download and set up the software are emailed to students prior to the first class.",Prachi Patel,3:10pm,5:00pm,11008,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,MATLAB: Computer Modeling,Summer High School Program,STEM,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STEM/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202STEM0100K001,LECTURE

TCOL PS0101,"Creating Original Theater: Playwriting,","This course is designed for students with experience in drama who are interested in exploring the intersection between digital technology and theater. We experiment with new forms of digital collaboration to create original cyber-theater experiences. The course emphasizes the working relationship between writers, performers, and directors as collaborators and co-creators of new cyber-theater material.
 
 Workshops and lectures in the first week introduce students to emerging forms of cyber-theater, digital theater, and telematic theater. Students participate in all aspects of exploration and creation of cyber-theater projects as we build our theatrical vocabulary together. In the second and third weeks, students have the option of specializing in one or more areas: writing, performance, or direction. The remainder of the course is given over to the development of short cyber-theater experiences written, performed, and directed by the students under the supervision and guidance of program teachers. Students work in small autonomous groups to create a cyber-theater experience that is presented live before an online audience at the end of the program.
 
 The majority of the course is taught via synchronous online workshops, which are highly interactive. Evolving material is periodically shared with the entire class for feedback and creative input in a constructive and supportive environment. All asynchronous assignments are to be viewed and worked on during our daily workshop time.
 
 This course affords students a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience with an emerging and cutting edge form of theatrical collaboration.",Dyana J Kimball,3:10pm,5:00pm,10986,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,CREATING ORIGINAL THEATER,Summer High School Program,TCOL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/TCOL/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202TCOL0101N001,LECTURE

TELE PS0101,"Creating Television: Pitching, Writing,","Students learn how to develop their own TV shows in this hands-on course. The focus is on writing for television, which is at the heart of the creative process, but we also look at the history of the medium, how to pitch a show, and production. Ultimately participants film mini-pilots or key scenes from the shows they have developed.
 
 We begin with a brief history of television in the United States – its creation and how it has grown over the past seven decades. Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or “reality”) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.
 
 While learning about the “TV greats,” students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers’ medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.
 
 The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",Mark A Christopher,3:10pm,5:00pm,10988,Morningside,N0101-20202-001,Creating Television,Summer High School Program,TELE,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/TELE/N0101-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202TELE0101N001,LECTURE

TRAD PS0218,Trial Advocacy,"Designed for students with a strong interest in law, oral argument, and mock trial, this course immerses participants in the adversarial world of the trial court.
 
 Following an introduction to the United States legal system, students acquire a solid understanding of the trial process, including jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses and experts, introduction of exhibits, closing arguments, and theory building. Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.
 
 Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.
 
 The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.
 
 Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently. At the heart of the program are daily exercises, designed to hone students' trial skills, that are rooted in a hypothetical legal case.

First, using the rich quantitative evidence and mapping tools in several data portals (both proprietary and open source) and the powerful data management tools in Excel, students will compile “data portraits” of each neighborhood in the region.  Then, using Excel, students will learn basic descriptive and inferential statistics and apply these methods to characterize neighborhoods along the diversity-inequality axes.  In the course capstone project, they will combine their data analysis with their annotated visual impressions of each neighborhood into a digital portfolio which they will present to the class. By the end of the course students will have not only have deepened their understanding of the city (and perhaps their own neighborhoods), but will also have acquired an intermediate level proficiency in Excel, learned the rudiments of data management and descriptive and inferential statistics, and a variety of quantitative and qualitative social science approaches to urban studies.",Mary Rocco,,,00027,Barnard College,S0200-20202-001,URBAN STUDIES,Pre-College Program (Barnard),URBP,http://culpa.info/professors/13554,,2.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBP/S0200-20202-001/,,,,0,,,20202URBP0200S001,SEMINAR

Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field.

WARS PS0100,International Humanitarian Law: Regulati,"Is international humanitarian law (IHL) still relevant in regulating warfare in the 21st Century? Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.
 
 In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.
 
 In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.
 
 Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film. Class time is divided between lecture and discussion of the reading assignments, and film screenings, debates, group projects, and student presentations.",Alexander D de la Paz,3:10pm,5:00pm,11010,Morningside,K0100-20202-001,International Humanitaria,Summer High School Program,WARS,http://culpa.info/professors/14002,,1.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WARS/K0100-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20202WARS0100K001,LECTURE

Students will develop a critical vocabulary and practice a variety of modes of hearing and analyzing the meanings and effects of popular music. By examining popular music in relation to intersections of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability, the body, class, politics, and activism, students will examine a wide repertory of music by using a variety of analytical “sieves,” refining and enriching their musical experience as critically astute listeners and writers. The course weaves together close listening with some of the central writings on women musical artists, listening, and feminist theory through seminar-style discussion and written work.

Questions we will explore include: what is reproductive justice, and how does it differ from reproductive rights and health? How have long histories of reproductive violence shaped the reproductive justice mission? How do these histories influence the development and distribution of medical/technological/pharmaceutical innovations? How has the reproductive justice mission taken shape in New York City in particular, and what does it look like today?

Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing.

WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",Rachel E Carter,5:30pm,8:40pm,10213,Morningside,S4323-20202-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20202-001/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,TR,20202WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR

The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors.

To begin, we will look at writers writing about art, from the Romantic period through the present. The modes of this art writing we will consider include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which address or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, John Ashbery, and Eileen Myles, who for periods of their lives worked as art critics; writers such as Etel Adnan and Alexander Kulge, who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure; as well as numerous collaborations between writers and visual artists. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers, like artists Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, David Wojnarowicz, Moyra Davey, Paul Chan, and Hannah Black, as well as professional critics whose work has been elevated to the status of literature, such as Hilton Als, Janet Malcolm, and Susan Sontag. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of sonic and visual artists, such as those associated with Dada, the Harlem Renaissance, the New York School, and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course, students will also be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. They will produce original works in various of the modes described above and complete a final writing project that incorporates what they have learned.",Thomas A Donovan,5:30pm,8:40pm,12033,Morningside,W3215-20202-002,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3215-20202-002/,ONLINE CLAS,In-Person,,3,,MW,20202WRIT3215W002,SEMINAR

WRTE PS0101,Expository Writing Intensive: How to Wri,"Participants learn how to read challenging texts and write about them clearly and coherently, assess and think critically about their own writing, and improve writing skills through in-class exercises, homework, and revisions. Readings for the course are taken from several disciplines, including literature, history, journalism, and social sciences.
 
 This course enables students to identify their strengths and weaknesses in writing and to improve their skills through individual and group work. We read and analyze short essays that exemplify good writing, and we learn how to define a thesis, organize an essay, and incorporate appropriate vocabulary.

ZOO_ PS0100,Inside the Animal Mind: What Animals Thi,"Do rats laugh? Do dogs pretend? Can birds use tools? While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.
 
 This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology—the study of animal minds—and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin’s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the “father of cognitive ethology,” whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.
 
 In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson. These pioneering researchers fundamentally changed our understanding of the animal mind, shedding new light on the extraordinary and diverse abilities of our fellow species to learn, problem-solve, use tools, express emotions, and even mourn their dead. What’s more, we are learning that animals communicate complex information in ways we could never have imagined.
 
 Virtual tours of the Wild Bird Fund and the Wolf Conservation Center in Westchester County offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behavior and speak to experts about their research. These experiences provide context for the material covered in class and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions. Students also have an opportunity to explore the broad array of academic and career paths that relate to cognitive ethology, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, conservation biology, psychology, philosophy and ethics, cognitive neuroscience, science writing, and animal law.
