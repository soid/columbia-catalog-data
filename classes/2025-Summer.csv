ACCT B7007,Financial Planning & Analysis,"This course explores the use of financial information for internal planning, analysis, and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.
 Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
 The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal-reporting mistakes.
 To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.
 
 We will examine the following key topics:
 ? Designing managerial information systems to support an organization’s strategy.
 ? Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.
 ? Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.
 ? The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.
 ? The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.
 ? Activity-based costing and activity-based management.
 ? Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.
 ? Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.
 ? The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.
 ? The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",Tim Baldenius,3:45pm,6:45pm,10981,,B7007-20252-001,Financial Planning & Anal,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7007-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

ACCT B7009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?
The course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models – models that use
financial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements – but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models – but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that
you have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.
By the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private
equity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",Benjamin Segal,12:30pm,3:30pm,11001,,B7009-20252-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7009-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Business,3,,F,20252ACCT7009B001,LECTURE

ACCT B8009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"This course will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing financial statements. Students will learn about the general tools, theoretical concepts, and practical valuation issues of financial analysis. By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.
Course content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm’s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:
1. Understand the firm’s strategy. We will assess the firm’s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.
2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.
3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.
4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.
5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm’s current value. 
In the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",Kalash Jain,9:00am,5:00pm,10965,,B8009-20252-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8009-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

This course introduces the relationship between contemporary artistic practices and the Venice Biennale. The Biennale has become one of the most important international contemporary art and architecture fairs. This course will expose students to the historical, political, and cultural developments linked to the biennale from its inception in 1895 to present day. In addition to regular class meetings with slide lectures and seminar-style discussion in the classroom, students will visit exhibition spaces located in the historical pavilions of the giardini (fair gardens), the arsenale (a 16th century warehouse space now used to host sections of this contemporary art installations), and other temporary venues located throughout the city as we investigate not only the art, but also the unique spaces in which we encounter it. Beyond a focus on the history of the Venice Biennale, the course will introduce some of the key concepts of contemporary art as they have developed in the past three or so decades.

Instructor: Johanna M.H. Fassl
  
Syllabus, Art in Venice
  
This course examines the art, architecture, and culture of Venice from the 14th to the 18th century. The goal of the curriculum is for students to acquire a firm visual literacy in order to read works of Venetian art and to familiarize themselves with the methods of art history. The course is set up as a field study, using the city as classroom and supporting site visits in and outside of Venice. The goal is to provide students with a solid visual knowledge and historical understanding of a set of key monuments, and to encourage them to think through the social, political, cultural, and intellectual forces at play in the creation of these works. Each day's choice of monuments is based on a walkable itinerary, visiting churches, confraternities, cloisters, palaces, and museums. Day trips include excursions to Padua and the Palladian villas in Vicenza and the Veneto.

AHIS S3107,Constructing the Sacred in Ancient Greec,"This course examines the conception and spatialization of religious experience in ancient Greece through brief chronological surveys and thematic case studies. Definitions of “sacred,” “ritual,” and “divine” will frame lectures and class discussions on cult locations and religious architecture in mainland Greece and western Asia Minor from the Archaic (8th century BCE) to the Early Roman Imperial (2nd century CE) periods.
  
The architectural articulation of sanctuaries will be observed in relation to socio-political, historical, and artistic conditions in which these spaces were formed and existed. Case studies will involve both conventional (e.g., athletic) and idiosyncratic (e.g., healing, mystery performances) cult practices.
  
The second half of the summer session will focus on the materiality of the sacred through smallscale dedications and will make use of the vast collections of the Metropolitan Museum. Finally, we will observe NYC’s urban fabric in walking tours where we consider Greek Revival architecture and phenomena such as continuity, transformation, de-sacralization, and secularization.",Muge Arseven,1:00pm,4:10pm,11275,,W3107-20252-001,Constructing the Sacred,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3107-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252AHIS3107W001,SEMINAR

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

We will examine the architectural as well as the social, historical, and political environment of nineteenth and twentieth century New York City, in which medieval architecture came to symbolize not only religion but also erudition, exoticism, heritage, education, civic pride, and even hygiene. Alongside Gothic Revival churches, skyscrapers, campuses, and parks, this course will consider other forms of medieval architectural revivalism (including Moorish Revival synagogues and Romanesque Revival rowhouses) as well as projects that physically relocated medieval buildings to New York City both for private collections and public display. We will combine regular field trips to sites around the city with readings and discussions and will make use of the archives of several prominent revivalist architects in Avery Library’s collections.",Danny Smith,9:00am,12:10pm,10611,,W3427-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3427-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252AHIS3427W001,SEMINAR

This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts.

Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the ""long"" nineteenth century, and how events of the period continue to impact our country today. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.  With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",Page S Knox,9:00am,12:10pm,10609,,S3442-20252-001,"American Art, 1750   1914",Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/S3442-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252AHIS3442S001,SEMINAR
AHIS S3448,"Theories, Methods, and Experiments in Ar","The use of artificial intelligence—propelled by deep learning techniques—to analyze, curate, and generate digital images is having a profound influence on visual culture, one that well exceeds Jacques Derrida's anticipations of the effects of technology on society as he described them in Archive Fever. While regulation around emerging technologies such as AI is being formulated across the globe with much urgency, a problematic concept of “tech ethics” is being espoused by the leading technology companies that imposes a simplistic moralistic framework on potential policies. Through examination of the creative applications of AI, the aim of this seminar is to foster a nuanced critical discourse on AI art that places the ethics of emerging technologies at center stage. This course provides students with an introduction to the history of AI art and explores the challenges and opportunities that this burgeoning field faces, especially in regard to the regulation of technology. Class visits to Mercer Labs, Artechouse, MoMA, and the Whitney will allow students to directly engage with the core concepts of the seminar.
  
The course begins with reflection on Adorno’s prescient statement that technical rationality is “the rationality of domination,” and challenges both the cynicism and optimism around emerging technologies and their effect on visual culture. We will question the accountability that art history and other fields of study have, if any, to steer the ethics debates spurred by today’s “culture industry” of digital images, and ask what the custodianship of this space entails by examining its structures of power, conveyed visually or through automated processes enabled by computer vision science. By interrogating the socio-cultural effects of the use of machine learning on images—such as algorithmic biases that lend to discrimination, or surveillance and privacy concerns in regard to facial recognition technologies—new and diverse perspectives on visual culture are investigated. Although the mechanisms that enable technology to develop may be lending to the commodification and homogenization of visual culture, the seemingly democratic promises that big tech touts keep us captivated yet surprisingly uncritical. If the transformative role of AI on our visual culture is constituting a new type of archaeology of knowledge, how do we critically lend to its discourse through the theories, methods, and experiments surrounding art and AI?",Emily Spratt,1:00pm,4:10pm,11276,,W3448-20252-001,Theories in Art and AI,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3448-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252AHIS3448W001,SEMINAR
AHIS UN2427,Twentieth-Century Architecture,"This course examines some of the key moments of architectural modernity in the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how architecture participated in the making of a new world order. It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts.

Furthermore, the course challenges stereotypes of Islam, and of people who one way or another can be called Muslims; most often perceived as a homogenous category through which all Muslim societies are imagined. The course is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the idea of “anthropology of Islam” through different readings in anthropology and various, experiences, practices, dimensions of Islam as a relationship between humans and God. In the second part, the focus is to listen to Islam and connect the different sonic bodies of Islam to power and politics. The third part interrogates preconceived ideas about Islam, gender, feminism, and agency. The fourth part studies Islam, body, sexuality and eroticism. The fifth part is concerned with Islam, youth culture, identity, belonging and rebellion.

Over the course of the semester students will learn to “locate” the city jail in a number of different ways: within the complex political and economic structures of the American municipality, within the criminal justice system writ large, and within the country’s long history of anti-black racism and struggles for freedom. In addition to readings and discussions, students will get to know practices of municipal incarceration first-hand through observations in New York City’s criminal courthouses and other ethnographic excursions in the city.

Taking as objects of study both the jail itself and the practice of incarcerating people in local jails, this course will combine scholarly work on U.S. criminal justice with a variety of non-academic texts including legal decisions, contemporary journalism, and documentary film. Over the course of the semester students will learn to “locate” the city jail in a number of different ways: within the complex political and economic structures of the American municipality, within the criminal justice system writ large, and within the country’s long history of anti-black racism and struggles for freedom. In addition to readings and discussions, students will get to know practices of municipal incarceration first-hand through observations in New York City’s criminal courthouses and other ethnographic excursions in the city. Because we are in New York City, we will pay particular attention throughout the semester to Rikers Island and the city’s proposed Borough-Based Jails Plan.",Kaya N Williams,1:00pm,4:10pm,00072,,W2052-20252-002,Understanding City Jails,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W2052-20252-002/,To be announced,,"Architecture

ANTH UN3751,Personhood,"This seminar seeks to engage with materials that question personhood. Drawing on both fictional and non-fictional accounts, we will be involved with textual and visual documents as well institutional contexts in order to revisit such notion under contemporary capitalism. We will cover topics like rites of passage and life cycle, the role of the nation state and local communities in defining a person, the relation between self and non-self, between the living and the dead. We will likewise address vicarious forms of personhood through the prosthetic, the avatar or the heteronomous. But we will also look into forms of dissipation and/or enhancement of personhood through bodybuilding, guinea-piging and pharmo-toxicities. As a whole, the course will bring to light how the question of personhood cross-culturally relates to language, performativity, religion, technology, law, gender, race, class, care, life and death.",Maria Jose de Abreu,1:00pm,4:10pm,10513,,W3751-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3751-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252ANTH3751W001,SEMINAR

ARTP BC0002,Global Modernism,"The aim of this course is to explore the history and discourses of modern art, modernism, and the
 avant-garde via the social and theoretical questions understood to have driven the development
 of artistic modernism around the globe from roughly 1789 to 1968. The course will be organized
 according to four major lenses of inquiry: “Aesthetic Categories within Social Art Histories,”
 “Formalism and Autonomy,” “Perception and Artistic Production,” and “the Role of the Mind,
 or, the Beholder’s Share.” Each of these lenses, or themes, will be driven by a set of readings,
 images, and key terms that together constitute “conversations,” or orientations toward the history
 of modern art. An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into
 focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader
 discourse. However, because there is a fair amount of conceptual overlap among the course’s
 themes, the foremost goal is to enable critical analysis of modern, visual artworks from multiple
 perspectives, or within multiple frameworks. In considering the many, dynamic engagements of
 theory, history, and visual artworks, this course will provide not only a strong knowledge of
 modern art, modernism, and the avant-garde, it will also help students develop a sense of the
 methods used to study the histories and theories of modern art.",Nicole Coffineau,9:30am,12:00pm,00003,,S0002-20252-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0002-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252ARTP0002S001,SEMINAR

BIET K5315,Special Topics in Philosophical Bioethic,"This course is designed to afford students significant opportunity to explore fundamental bioethical issues in a philosophically searching way. For example, it is generally thought that health matters. But then what is health? And how does it matter? What is justice in respect to health-care and the other social determinants of health? Do competing theories of justice (e.g., liberal, libertarian, utilitarian) offer incompatible solutions to the question of healthcare justice? Or can a workable “overlapping consensus” at the public policy level nevertheless be achieved?
  
Should a healthcare professional be permitted, on grounds of conscience, to refuse to provide a healthcare service to which people are lawfully permitted? Indeed, what should count as “conscience”? In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, some have argued for a right to conscientiously insist on providing reproductive services that have been legally prohibited. How are we to sort through and resolve this complicated set of issues?
  
Could a meaningful personal understanding of what it means for someone to have died nevertheless not be suitable as the basis for a legal declaration of death? Why not? Should there be a “conscience clause” option whereby someone can specify in advance the conception of death to be applied in that individual’s own case? Would every possible criterion be available or would certain criteria have to be excluded? Which? Why?
  
The population in this and many other societies is aging and putting increasingly significant demands on the healthcare delivery system. Should healthcare be rationed according to age?  Would it be unfair to young people not to give weight to that factor—lest they lose out on a fair chance to live as long as society’s seniors already have? What is healthcare justice across the generations?
  
As researchers gain a fuller understanding of the aging process, it may soon be possible to genetically engineer a significant extension (even doubling?) of human life-span. Is this an appropriate objective for healthcare science to be pursuing?  Is the point of healthcare to extend human life as far as possible by whatever means? Is aging a kind of “disease” in its own right? Would life so dramatically extended be beneficial or burdensome?
  
The topics for this course have been selected in view of (i) how fundamental they are to bioethical thinking (e.g., What is health?",Arthur Kuflik,6:00pm,8:00pm,10937,,K5315-20252-D01,Advanced Philosophical BI,Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5315-20252-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Nursing

BIET K5435,"ST Leadership, Ethics & Drug Development","Special Topics in Leadership, Ethics and Drug Development
  
In Ethical leadership decisions regarding drug development, regulation and delivery is a multi-dimensional process with varied stakeholders, each having their own objectives.  This course will provide students with a look at how leaders in health care faced with real-life decisions utilized ethics to determine an outcome. The course is designed as a one week intensive in-person course, with two guest lecturers per day from industry, government, funding organizations, HCPs and patient organizations to help students gain a greater understanding of all stakeholders involved in health care decision making. 
  
Through posted and classroom discussion, speakers will address and students will be challenged to consider the following questions:
  
  
Who are the relevant stakeholders?  What are their preferences and do they conflict?  If so, how is this conflict best resolved?
  
How do we apply a bioethical framework – the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice -- to this problem?
  
When understanding how a new medicine is developed, how are the long and short term risks, large and small, weighed and evaluated against potential benefits?
  
Does industry consider justice– such as access and affordability – when deciding what products to develop?
  
What would you advise if you were an ethics consultant?
  
What do you think about the actions taken to address the issue?
  
How are ethical questions handled within organizations?  Are consultants used formally or informally to ensure outside perspectives?

BIOL UN1201,Engineered Mouse Models and Identifying,"This undergraduate lecture course will introduce how transgenic and mutant mouse models are generated and their utility in defining the functional roles of genes in vivo.  Classically, the function of a gene is tested in vivo by either overexpressing or inactivating its expression, leading to a gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotype from which is inferred a gene’s normal role in homeostasis.  Here we will explore the classic strategies for the generation of transgenic and knockout mice, comparing and contrasting their individual strengths and weaknesses, while exploring the phenotypes that have resulted from these changes in gene expression.  Using a subset of primary papers, students will be introduced to research analysis to become more versed in the layers of experimental design needed to identify a gene’s function in vivo.   The theoretical timing and the strategy needed to design such experiments with these transgenic and mutant mouse models, and the power of stem cell experiments will be discussed.    
  
In addition, to develop critical and additional analytical skills, students will become versed in basic tissue histology and immunohistochemistry, using processed paraffin-embedded mouse tissues from wild-type and engineered mutant mouse lines.  Students will learn how to recognize numerous, normal adult tissues with light microscopy and to identify proliferative zones vs. fully differentiated layers within each.  In addition, they will analyze the development of mid-to-late gestational embryos in serial sections, to underscore the coordinated transformation of tissues required for normal embryonic development.  Finally, serial sections from well-defined mutant mouse models will used to identify and characterize abnormal phenotypes resulting from the knock-out of genes encoding cell cycle regulators or tumor suppressors.  Live animal handling or experimentation is not a component of this course.",Lili Yamasaki,1:00pm,2:30pm,10534,,W1201-20252-001,Mouse Models & Phenotypes,Summer Session (SUMM),BIOL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W1201-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,MWF,20252BIOL1201W001,LECTURE

Should a national policy on X be implemented? Does Vitamin C truly prevent colds? However, do we really know what these terms and phrases mean?

The course combines case discussion and analysis (approximately two thirds) with lectures (one third).  The emphasis is on the ability to apply a small number of principles effectively and creatively, not the mastery of detailed aspects of the theory.  The course offers excellent background for all consultants, managers and corporate finance generalists.",Wouter Dessein,9:00am,5:00pm,10980,,B8216-20252-001,ECONOMICS OF STRATEGIC BE,Business Economics,BUEC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8216-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

BUEC B8776,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies a","Given the impact of technological tools and advancements in todays modern economy, it has become increasingly imperative for business professionals and professional graduate students to have a top-down understanding of some of the most relevant, applicable, and highly technical topics such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and digital tokens (among others). This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters.

BUSI B8705,Business and Climate Change,"Climate science informs us that global emissions of greenhouse gas emissions must be rapidly and dramatically reduced if humanity is to avoid catastrophic climate change. After three centuries of rising emissions, the entire global economy must now decarbonize in the coming three decades. Fortunately, most of the technologies and investment capital necessary to reduce and eventually eliminate emissions exist or are in development, but the urgency to implement those solutions is critical.
This course provides an overview of climate change, its effects on business, and how businesses can (and should) respond. The course covers emissions sources and their impact on climate change, followed by an exploration of the policy landscape, including current legislation, carbon markets, and climate justice. The course then evaluates current and evolving mitigation technologies, reviews the tools of climate finance, and considers strategies for reducing emissions to net zero. Finally, the course introduces the role of businesses in addressing climate change, including net-zero goals, actions they can take to mitigate their impact, and the perspectives of shareholders.

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

CLCV UN1006,Aristotle & AI,"What do the robots in ancient Greek mythology have to tell us about today’s AI? How did slavery shape how Greeks and Romans imagined autonomous tools? Where does artificial intelligence come from, and why do we tell the stories we do about what it can do and how it will change the world?
 This course offers an introduction to the intellectual history of classical antiquity and a critical examination of artificial intelligence in the current cultural and political moment. Students in the course will learn about a topic in ancient Greek and Roman thought — stories about autonomous tools — and how that topic relates to social history and culture in the ancient world. They will then use that knowledge to frame questions about artificial intelligence and robots in present society, and examine critical approaches to the large generative models that are garnering so much attention today. The goal is equip students with a) a basic familiarity with how ancient Greek and Roman thought relates to its cultural context, b) an analytical framework for approaching claims about technology in historical and present contexts, and c) an appreciation for how humanistic inquiry can answer urgent questions in their lives.
 Prerequisites: none
 The course is intended for students for little or no familiarity with the study of the ancient world, and as an introduction to the study of ancient Greece and Rome. Familiarity with texts encountered in the fall semesters of Literature Humanities or Contemporary Civilizations will be helpful, but is neither required or presumed on the part of the instructor.",Joseph A Howley,1:00pm,4:10pm,11087,,W1006-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/W1006-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252CLCV1006W001,LECTURE

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",Lien Van Geel,9:00am,12:10pm,10240,,S3058-20252-001,Worlds of Alexander the G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/S3058-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252CLCV3058S001,LECTURE

Based on the reading of literary texts (short stories, theater), as well as letters, biographies, memoirs, and other ego-documents produced and consumed in the Early Modern Mediterranean, we will discuss big themes as Orientalism, estrangement, forced mobility, connectivity, multiculturalism and the clash of civilizations. Also, we will visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Rare Books Room of Butler Library, and we will discuss movies in class.

CLIA OC4600,Mediterranean Humanities II in Venice,"CLIA4600OC: Mediterranean Humanities II in Venice. 3 points. 
Prerequisite: None. Mediterranean Humanities I is not a requirement to enroll in this course. Instructor: Konstantina Zanou
  
What is the Mediterranean and how was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization? A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and political difference, the Mediterranean has been seen as the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing border and a unifying confluence zone, as a sea of pleasure and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. By exploring major works of theory, literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, South/North and East/West divides, tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism, borders and divided societies) and to ‘read’ the sea through different viewpoints. In the final analysis, Med Hum II is meant to arouse the question of what it means to stand on watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly shifting lens. The Summer version of the course is adapted to contain more material on Venice and its Mediterranean surroundings.

CLMT G5018,Building Equitable Community Partnership,"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional
 effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a “whole of community” approach to disaster management.
 
 The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:
  
  
Describe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience
  
Describe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle
  
Identify whole community approaches for disaster management
  
Identify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management
  
Demonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",Jeffrey Schlegelmilch,3:00pm,4:45pm,10930,,G5018-20252-001,Building Partnerships in,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5018-20252-001/,To be announced,Hybrid,,1.5,,TR,20252CLMT5018G001,SEMINAR

CLMT G5032,Disaster Research Methods,"The field of disaster research is relatively new in the United States, as a specific field of study, with the first disaster research center being founded in the early 1960s. The field itself is now highly multi-disciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, anthropology, political science, computer science, engineering, earth sciences, psychology, and medicine and public health. These academic fields have intersected with the practice community by informing holistic emergency planning for all members of a community. Furthermore, these research outputs have informed federal and state policy, the private sector, and community organizations to inform program design and implementation. Translating research into practice remains a constant challenge in this rapidly evolving field. The methodological approaches to disaster research are just as diverse and have become increasingly complex with the advent of big data, the ubiquity of spatial information, and novel cross-disciplinary research. As a new era of compound and cascading disasters has triggered a constant “response” mode within the field of emergency management, the need for practitioners and research with a fluency in research and evaluation methods is required to critically evaluate or generate high quality and ethically based research.",Jonathan J Sury,3:00pm,4:45pm,10932,,G5032-20252-001,,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5032-20252-001/,To be announced,Hybrid,,1.5,,TR,20252CLMT5032G001,LECTURE
CLMT G5041,"Climate Ethics, Leadership and Managemen","Often, our progress toward the remediation of persistently accumulating human damage to our collective home, the biosphere, is attributed to large-scale entities having a rather amorphous quality. Such are the industrial revolution, the global north, capitalism, colonialism, and countless preoccupied, habituated or denialist components of the human population. Yet, the dynamics of all types of leadership and management, whether in public, civic or private organizations, frequently push back on the progress desired, in more specific ways. These dynamics are so characteristic that climate ethics, an offshoot of environmental ethics, may seem to be cornered or futile. However, looking more closely at the essential functions of leadership and management, we may find the possibilities of change for the better: change that reverses climate change, or more widely, unsustainability. Conversely, we may find inadequate possibilities for such critical change.
  
In this course, leadership and management are explored to determine their dynamics are and how these afflict our biospheric home—including virtually all life.  The course is divided into 4 sections, the 1st is two weeks long, the 2nd and 3rd are each four weeks long, and the 4th is two weeks long.  The topic of the 1st section is climate ethics, their content and context:  how they work and how they are tripped by surrounding problematic discourses. The topic of the 2nd section is leadership: at its becomingly best, and how it demeans itself with incapability, irresponsibility and corruptibility. The topic of the 3rd section is management: at its operationally best, and how it degrades itself with dysfunctional hierarchy, captive systematization, and offensive behavior.  The topic of the 4th section reverts to climate ethics: the necessity of accruing and maintaining value—of the right kind, and the necessity of creating and applying guidance—of the right kind.  It is not only because the impacts of problematic ways of doing things are harmful to the biosphere but also because those impacts have others, which are increasingly desperate, rancorous and volatile.",Adela J Gondek,3:00pm,4:45pm,10933,,G5041-20252-001,"Climate Ethics, Leader &",Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5041-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252CLMT5041G001,SEMINAR
CLMT G5042,Financial Analysis of Climate Risk: An I,"The signing of the Paris Treaty in 2015 signaled a recognition by nearly all the world’s governments of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile, the changing climate is already having negative impacts on business assets and operations around the world. Despite evidence that climate change poses a threat to business as usual for many companies, the financial sector has yet to form a consistent view on how to value risks and opportunities associated with climate change. There are multiple reasons for this. Climate-related disclosures vary widely from company to company, as do the ways that climate risks affect different sectors and geographies. The policy landscape is varied and fast changing. Unfortunately, many financial analysts lack the technical knowledge to assess corporate disclosures and actions pertaining to climate.
  
This 6-week course provides a practical overview of how analysts in the financial sector can assess corporate climate risk and opportunity among publicly traded corporates, using public data. The class will begin with the concept of how business leaders and financial analysts understand climate risk – alongside other concepts such as decarbonization, transition planning and climate impacts from a policy perspective. 
  
We will then move to focus on industry-specific analysis in four sectors – 1) oil and gas, 2) consumer staples, 3) mining, and 4) financial services. In each, we will survey the tools that investors have to assess climate risk and opportunity, taking into account policy, voluntary frameworks, and technology. For each of these elements, we will review both how these tools can assist with climate risk analysis as well as their limitations and inconsistencies. We will consider ways the analyst can work with relevant data and reconcile public corporate claims with evidence through corporate disclosures.",,11:00am,2:30pm,11088,,G5042-20252-001,Fin.

CLMT G5044,Spatial Analysis of Food Security,"Globally, there are over 2 billion people suffering from moderate-to-severe food insecurity, with an estimated 600 million people projected to be chronically undernourished by 2030. One key aspect to understanding food insecurity is its spatial distribution and trends that contribute to how food secure a population is. This course will teach students how to collect and analyze spatial data related to food security, as well as touch on important topics in food insecurity. The course will focus on taking real-life food security questions and applying spatial analysis techniques to these questions. In the course, we will cover an introduction to spatial analysis, natural experiments in geography, applying remote sensing to food insecurity, climate shocks and food security, and seasonal forecasting and food security.
  
It will have an in-class aspect, which will mainly focus on topics in food security and how they relate to data collection, and a lab section which will be an opportunity for students to collect data directly, clean the data, and analyze the data using the R programming language with spatial research methods. Example topics in class will be climate variability and food insecurity, women’s role in agriculture and their rates of food insecurity relative to men, and population and health. These topics will then be further explored in the lab section of the class: specifically focusing on downloading weather data for time series analysis, using a convergence of datasets to map hotspots, and investigating how survey data intersects with spatial datasets.
  
In this course, there will be two components; a lecture and a lab. The lecture will be short and focus on relevant topics in Food Security and methodology used to quantitative analyze these topics. The lab will be a computer-based lab in R, analyzing relevant food security data using techniques discussed during the lecture to provide a practical base for quantitative analyses.",Sarah L Blakeley,1:00pm,2:45pm,11171,,G5044-20252-001,Spatial Analysis Food Sec,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5044-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,MW,20252CLMT5044G001,SEMINAR

The Laughter of Medusa
, Hélène Cixous compared women’s writing—in French, “écriture féminine”—to the unexplored African continent. To date, literary criticism has been grappling with the distinct qualities of literary works, crafted by women. This course offers a survey of main autofictional works and memoirs, written originally in the Russian language within the last 100 years. We will start our journey with the tumults of the WW1 and the Bolshevik Revolution, the Civil War, through the WW2, the Soviet dissident movement, the emigration waves into Israel and the United States, the advent of a post-socialist Russia in 1991—in order to arrive at the two plus decades of Vladimir Putin’s presidency. We will consider  the ways in which each author transposes and conveys her own—and others’ memories—through the medium of autofiction, defined by Serge Doubrovsky, who coined the term in French, as “the adventure of the language, outside of wisdom and the syntax of the novel.” All selected works, with very few exceptions, are available in English;  no reading knowledge of Russian is required.

CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.

COMM PS5270,CONTENT STRATEGY,"Sitting at the intersection of business strategy, digital development, user experience, communication, and publishing, content strategy has emerged over the last few years as a discipline examining the purpose behind content (in all manifestations) and how it supports business, organizational, and user goals.

Content strategy provides a holistic approach for unlocking the value behind content and for increasing its effectiveness in achieving business and organizational objectives. This course will present the fundamentals of content strategy and explore the discipline’s approaches, techniques, and tools that course participants can apply directly to the content situation in their own organization. It will draw parallels with – and highlight distinctions among – traditional communication strategy, publishing, and content strategy, and provide students with a framework to create a sustainable program grounded in meaningful, actionable content.",Jenny M Fernandez,8:10pm,10:00pm,11162,,K5270-20252-D01,CONTENT STRATEGY (ONLINE),Strategic Communication,COMM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COMM/K5270-20252-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,W,20252COMM5270KD01,LECTURE

CPLS OC3456,1968 Paris,"Instructor 
Bruno Bosteels
, Dean of Humanities and Jesse and George Siegel Professor in the Humanities in the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures and the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society. 
Taught in English.
  
""1968"" remains a watershed year in the history of worldwide struggles for liberation and emancipation. For many the last gasp of the revolutionary era, for others the beginning of a new regime of flexible control. The hypothesis for this seminar holds that ""1968"" matters for a thinking of the event in two essential ways: not only may we ask what happened but we also should ask how we can talk of the happening of an event in the first place. Alternating theoretical and fictional, historical and artistic, filmic and political materials, students will be expected to develop an original take on one aspect of the paradigm shift that affects the thinking of the events of “1968” during that exceptional month of May in Paris, while keeping a close eye on the national and international contexts behind the global sixties.
  
This summer edition of the course will meet three times per week for two hours each, plus a weekly showing and discussion of a movie related to May 1968 in France and around the globe. In addition, the class will include day trips with a guided tour to the Quartier Latin in relation to May ’68 as well as the National Archives. To be confirmed are visits by contemporary theorists and philosophers such as Jacques Rancière or Alain Badiou, for whom May 1968 always was and remains a major touchstone event for their view of emancipatory politics.

DMVP BC1001,Functional Anatomy for Movement,"This is an introduction to the study of Countertechnique® taught by certified Teacher, Francesca Dominguez. Countertechnique® is a system of movement designed for dancers to practice self-direction and to cultivate availability to movement while learning to take risks. Developed over the past 25 years by Dutch choreographer, Anouk Van Dijk, the technique utilizes a task-based approach for body and mind as the vehicle to approach dance. It is a movement system that helps the dancer think with the dancing body by focusing on the process of incorporating anatomical information into action; and beginning to direct and counter-direct the body through space as an alternative to gripping or falling over. Dancers are encouraged to be proactive in discovering connections and solutions, to be less concerned with judging themselves, and to work in a healthy way physically, mentally, and emotionally. The priority is to experience clarity and enjoyment of movement while utilizing the Countertechnique® principles. ☺ www.countertechnique.com By the end of the semester, students will have a clarified relationship to space; a developed coordination and articulation of the body; they will gain knowledge about the anatomy of the body especially joint structure, location, and range; and will be able to begin Scanning – the ability to observe one’s own state-of-being and draw upon solutions according to need and/or experimentation.",Francesca Dominguez,9:30am,12:00pm,00006,,X1001-20252-001,Functional Anatomy Moveme,Pre-College Program (Barnard),DMVP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DMVP/X1001-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252DMVP1001X001,LECTURE

DROM B7103,Business Analytics II: Foundations of AI,"Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises such as businesses, non-profits, and governments use data to gain insights and make better decisions. Business analytics is applied in operations, marketing, finance, and strategic planning among other functions. Modern data collection methods – arising in bioinformatics, mobile platforms, and previously unanalyzable data like text and images – are leading an explosive growth in the volume of data available for decision making. The ability to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable decisions has been a critical strategic advantage for companies as diverse as Walmart, Google, Capital One, and Disney. Many startups are based on the application of AI & analytics to large databases. With the increasing availability of broad and deep sources of information – so-called “Big Data” – business analytics are becoming an even more critical capability for enterprises of all types and all sizes.
  
AI is beginning to impact every dimension of business and society. In many industries, you will need to be literate in AI to be a successful business leader. The Business Analytics sequence is designed to prepare you to play an active role in shaping the future of AI and business. You will develop a critical understanding of modern analytics methodology, studying its foundations, potential applications, and – perhaps most importantly – limitations.",Charles R Guetta,9:00am,1:00pm,11010,,B7103-20252-100,Business Analytics 2,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B7103-20252-100/,To be announced,In-Person,Business,1.5,,T,20252DROM7103B100,LECTURE
DROM B7114,Applied Regression Analysis,"This course is designed for students who wish to increase their capability to build, use, and interpret statistical models for business.
A primary goal of the course is to enable students to build and evaluate statistical models for managerial use in finance, operations and marketing. The focus is on generating managerially useful information and practical decision-making tools, rather than on statistical theory per se. A number of actual business cases are studied.
Concepts covered are multiple linear regression models and the computer-assisted methods for building them, including stepwise regression and all subsets regression. Emphasis is placed on diagnostic and graphical methods for testing the validity and reliability of regression models.
Course topics include a review of basic statistical ideas, numerical and graphical methods for summarizing data, simple linear and nonlinear regression, multiple regression, qualitative independent and dependent variables, diagnostic methods for assessing the validity of statistical models. The course studies applications of regression to business forecasting and also examines alternative times series forecasting models, including exponential smoothing.
While the primary focus of the course is on regression models, some other statistical models will be studied as well, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and goodness-of-fit tests.
Term project: A major aspect of course is the opportunity to carry out a practical statistical analysis project of one’s own. Students work in teams on a problem of their own choosing. The goal of the project is to develop a useful statistical model for a specific business problem, with the professor providing ongoing guidance and advice during the course of project. The teams will give an oral presentation of their results at the term’s end. 
Excel is used for basic statistical analysis as well as for developing straightforward regression models. In addition, more advanced commercial statistical software, such as Minitab or SAS, is used to carry out more complex and advanced analyses. In addition to the term project, there will be several computer-based assignments.",David Juran,3:45pm,6:45pm,11000,,B7114-20252-001,Applied Regression Analys,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B7114-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Business,1.5,,F,20252DROM7114B001,LECTURE
DROM B7117,"Business Analytics III: Modern AI, Deep","Business analytics refers to the methods enterprises—such as businesses, non-profits, and governments—use to analyze data to gain insights and make better decisions. This discipline is applied across various functions including operations, marketing, finance, and strategic planning. The advent of modern data collection methods in fields like bioinformatics, mobile platforms, and previously unanalyzable data (such as text and images) has led to an explosive growth in the volume of data available for decision-making. Utilizing data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable decisions has become a critical strategic advantage for diverse companies including Walmart, Google, Capital One, and Disney. Moreover, many startups are emerging based on the application of AI and analytics to large databases. With the increasing availability of broad and deep sources of information—often referred to as ""Big Data""—business analytics is becoming an even more essential capability for enterprises of all types and sizes.
  
AI is starting to influence every dimension of business and society. In many industries, being literate in AI is becoming a prerequisite for successful business leadership. The Business Analytics sequence is designed to prepare you to take an active role in shaping the future of AI and business.

DROM B8106,Operations Strategy,"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,"" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, ""Firm Boundaries,"" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, ""Internal Operations,"" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, ""New Challenges,"" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.""",Medini Singh,9:00am,5:00pm,10978,,B8106-20252-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8106-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

DROM B8131,Sports Analytics,"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. 
Students are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the ""laboratory"" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",Mark N Broadie,9:00am,5:00pm,10966,,B8131-20252-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8131-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

ECON BC3081,Economics of Work and Play,"In 1930 Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by the 21st century because he expected we would be at the foothills of the ""economic promised land."" He was more than right about technological progress and staggering productivity growth –– but dead wrong about the role work would play in our lives. Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions. 
  
 
  
This course is centered on the concept of ""work."" The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing. 
  
 
  
We begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge –– for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes ""work activity"" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of ""man"" and ""work.”
  
 
  
The course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market “facts” that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close ""exegesis"" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.",Lalith Munasinghe,1:00pm,4:10pm,00039,,X3081-20252-001,Economics of Work and Pla,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/X3081-20252-001/,To be announced,,Barnard College,3,,MW,20252ECON3081X001,LECTURE

 In order to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change, individuals, communities, organizations, and societies around the world – especially in wealthy nations – face the urgent need to implement significant changes, quickly. To avoid the worst climate scenarios, energy systems, patterns of production and consumption, political landscapes, daily habits, and even modes of thinking must evolve at every scale. The risks and impacts of climate change are well known and all too evident; and yet, global emissions continue to rise, natural ecosystems continue to be exploited and degraded, and frontline communities and nations continue to bear the brunt. To date, we have largely failed to implement the necessary changes to our current social and economic systems, by multiple metrics and at multiple scales. This course asks: what skills and practices are needed to more effectively spark, facilitate, accelerate, and manage the personal, social, organizational, and political changes needed at a range of scales to mitigate and adapt to climate change, all in an era of increasing disasters and social upheaval?
 
 Students will explore a range of texts and thinkers that grapple with the subject of change; gain fluency with a range of “change management” tools and frameworks; analyze strategies for facilitating, accelerating, or shaping change process in a range of organizations and systems; learn from a series of guest “change experts;” and build their own theory of change for a specific problem or system.

We learn how to analyze the evolutionary relationships of organisms and examine how dinosaurs came to be exemplars of a very successful group of organisms dominant on land for 140 million years. We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a “hot-house world”, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future.

An analysis of the assumptions underlying the use of climate proxies and their interpretations will be presented. Particular emphasis will be placed on amplifiers of climate change during the alternating ice ages and interglacial intervals of the last few million years, such as natural variations in atmospheric ""greenhouse gases"" and changes in deep water formation rates, as well as mechanisms of rapid climate change during the late Pleistocene. The influence of changes in the Earth's radiation distribution and boundary conditions on the global ocean circulation, Asian monsoon system and El Nino/Southern Oscillation frequency and intensity, as well as interactions among these systems will be examined using proxy data and models.

The goal is to introduce the participants to the basic concepts, skills, and tools of “positive political theory” in policymaking. A significant portion of the class material will be devoted to abstract theoretical foundations of strategic political interaction, which will prove instrumental in understanding and predicting patterns of political behavior and outcomes. Although there will be a sizable amount of literature you will be asked to rummage through, our approach will not be entirely interpretive. In fact, a significant amount of class time will be allocated to the practical application of knowledge gathered from readings and discussions. Although the reading materials will focus primarily on national policymaking in the United States, we will from time to time refer to other sub-national levels (i.e. states and municipal) and countries.",James J Kim,6:10pm,8:45pm,11281,,U6223-20252-001,Polit Enviro of Policymaking,International and Public Affairs,EMPA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EMPA/U6223-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,SIPA,3,,T,20252EMPA6223U001,LECTURE

The readings, lectures, and class discussions address ongoing debates over the prospects for global governance. Special attention is given to the role of international institutions, including the United Nations, regional organizations, and international financial institutions. We discuss global policies on investment and trade, combating poverty, and sustainable development. Pressing security issues are also discussed, including peacebuilding in war-torn societies, terrorism, cybersecurity, and weapons of mass destruction.
  
The format of the class combines open-ended lectures and interactive discussions of assigned readings. Each week, students discuss and debate three assigned articles that offer differing interpretations of the global dilemma addressed in the session. Assigned readings are carefully selected to convey of a range of opinions on controversial themes. Restricting the syllabus to several readings per week cannot do justice to the complexity of each topic.  However, a realistic reading assignment enables students to fulfill this requirement diligently, and you are expected to do so.

ENGL BC1022,BAD LOVE,"This seminar reads stories of love gone bad, of romances that end catastrophically, that damage lovers or leave victims along the way.   We will illuminate the consuming fantasy of the romance genre in its quest for “true love,” as well as a range of emotions – rage and revenge, narcissism and self-protection, obsession and oblivion – that surface in its wake.  We will also look at shifting interpretations of “bad love,” from Plato, to the Galenic theory of the humors, to the sociology of court-culture, to Freudian and finally contemporary neurobiological explanations of feelings.  Students are welcome to propose texts of their own interests to open this course to the widest range of interests.  In addition to seminar discussion, there will be weekly individual tutorials with Professor Hamilton as well as zoom interviews with a neurobiologist and a psychologist if it can be arranged.",Ross T Hamilton,1:00pm,4:10pm,00043,,X1022-20252-001,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1022-20252-001/,To be announced,,Barnard College,3,,MW,20252ENGL1022X001,SEMINAR

ENGL BC1068,True Crime,"Over the centuries, readers have been drawn to accounts of “true” crime—violent narratives involving real people and real events. And yet, as with any literary object, the notion of “truth” is always unstable—stories and their tellings are always shaped by the motivations, values, and choices of those who tell them, often with an eye toward the audience that will consume them. Whether constructed in order to moralize, to enforce or critique social or political ideologies, or purely to sell copies, “true
 crime” is a literary genre that reveals attitudes about gender, race, and class; that illustrates—and sometimes calls into question—cultural norms and mores; that calls on readers to reflect on their own morbid curiosity and assumptions and fears. In this class we will engage with a diverse selection of literary texts—spanning from the Middle Ages to the present day and from a range of genres, including pamphlets, plays, novels, and more—as well as contemporary films, a tv series, and a
 podcast. Through close reading and critical analysis, we will examine the evolution of the “true crime” genre and the cultural and societal contexts that shape the portrayal of crime for popular consumption. We will explore the ways in which texts and authors sensationalize, moralize, and convey the complexities of crime. We will analyze point of view: who’s telling the story, whom we sympathize with, and what insights we get into the minds of those committing crimes as well as those who fall prey to them. We will consider justice and policing— the role played by the law and its enforcers in shaping narratives about crime and punishment, right and wrong. Finally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of representing real-life crimes in literature, and how “true crime” narratives shape social perceptions, fears, prejudices, and notions of justice and morality.",Penelope Usher,9:00am,12:10pm,00045,,X1068-20252-001,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1068-20252-001/,To be announced,,Barnard College,3,,TR,20252ENGL1068X001,LECTURE

 gender, sexuality, morality, fear, and authority, among other things. For millennia, female spirituality
 and female sexuality have been paired in ways that reveal deep-seated anxieties about the female
 body and its power. From ancient Mesopotamian goddess worship to the frenzied witch hunts of
 early modern Europe to the child-devouring crones of folk tales from cultures around the world,
 we’ll delve into what the witch and those who name and pursue her reveal about deeply-held cultural
 beliefs, desires, and anxieties. We’ll work together to analyze the figure of the witch across time and
 space and develop our own ideas about why she is so constantly compelling. We’ll also look at our

ENGL BC3106,FICTION & PERSONAL NARRATIVE,"In this workshop, we will practice taking creative risks, writing fiction and nonfiction. We will examine four key craft areas: voice, characterization, imagery, and arrangement, both in contemporary published writing and in the writing of the people in this class. In small and large group workshops, we will consider each writer’s work with care and attention to the writer’s vision. By discussing each work-in-progress on its own terms, we will help our fellow writers deepen the meaning and impact of their work. Through risk-taking, and building a creative community, we will also grow and deepen our personal relationships to craft.

On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.

ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10133,,S3273-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3273-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3693,SALLY ROONEY- AUTHORSHIP IN THE 21ST CEN,"In this seminar, we will study “Sally Rooney.” In so doing, we will talk about the real author of that name: a thirty-year old Irishwoman whose three novels, each set in Ireland and concerning the social and erotic lives of attractive young people of European descent, have achieved remarkable commercial and critical success. We will talk about the pleasures of those texts, as well as their formal and generic features, their language and their relation to literary history.  But we will also discuss the idea and institution named “Sally Rooney,” considering it as what Michel Foucault called an “author function,” or what Pierre Bourdieu dubbed a “space of possibilities” within the literary field.
  
Our inquiry into “Sally Rooney” will, therefore, also be an inquiry into the meaning of literary authorship in the twenty-first century. Through secondary readings in criticism and theory, we will engage longstanding arguments about the relation between critical interpretation and authorial intention, as well as between social and historical “context” and authorial and aesthetic autonomy. We will examine how patterns of social exclusion — in this case, race — define the digitally-mediated literary field of the present. And we will ask how the rise of social media and online retail have altered ideas and institutions of authorship, audience, and literariness.",Matthew Hart,1:00pm,4:10pm,10520,,S3693-20252-001,SALLY ROONEY,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3693-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252ENGL3693S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.
  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order):

http://coms4170.cs.columbia.edu/2024-spring/
  
**Attendance required**
 This class is highly interactive, and attendance for many of the lectures is mandatory. Especially in the second half of the class, students must attend in-class project mentoring sessions to get feedback from their TA and fellow students.
  
 
**Technical Preparation**
 The first half of the class is quite technical, we introduce principles of usable design and integrate them in to technical assignments. There is a lot of programming in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python (server-side). Whereas we do teach these technologies, we constantly find that students who have seen them before have a better time in class. Former students have advised future students to do an online web programming series like CodeAcademy (which is sadly no longer free). Advanced Programming is an advised pre- requisite, but the true pre-requisite is simply coding experience. You will be expected to figure out some of the programming aspects by yourself, and you need the maturity to do that. Hint: ask GPT. If you are going to email me about this class, please use a subject line
 that says I read the SSOL message for COMS 4170 and I still have a question. I hope to see many of you in the spring :)

ENGL UN3638,Contemporary American Short Story Collec,"In 2013, Alice Munro was honored with the Nobel Prize in literature. Munro’s award was seen as a literary landmark: the first time that the prize was awarded to a writer whose exclusive form was the short story. The award was seen as fitting recognition, not only for this writer in particular, but also more broadly as moment of recognition for the short story’s importance as a genre, especially in a publishing industry that has long been dominated by the novel.
  
In this course, we will focus on the contemporary North American short story authors featured on our syllabus: Chimamanda Adichie, George Saunders, Lydia Davis, Carmen Machado, Leanne Simpson, Anthony Veasna So. Some of the writers on this list are veterans of the short story form. Others are authors who recently published debut collections. As we work through our reading list, we will attempt to analyze not only individual short stories, but also what marks these books as collections. What might hold these texts together? What disrupts the unifying principles of a collection? And most importantly, what do short stories offer—in terms of representations of American life and culture and itscomplexity—that other forms do not?",Denise Cruz,9:00am,12:10pm,10683,,S3638-20252-001,Contemp.

ENGL UN3699,Yaddo: Shaping the American Century,"Yaddo is an artists community located in Saratoga Springs, New York.  In the words of John Cheever, “the forty or so acres on which the studios and principal buildings of Yaddo stand have seen more distinguished activity in the arts that any other piece of ground in the English speaking community.”  Cheever, however, also described Yaddo’s menagerie of creatives as a group of, “lushes down on their luck, men and women at the top of their powers, nervous breakdowns, thieves, geniuses, cranky noblemen, and poets who ate their peas with a knife.”  In total this makes for spectacular drama.  
  
Historically speaking Yaddo is an idealized synergy of Gilded Age gender roles and is best understood as ½ Thomas Edison’s Menlo Park (“the Menlo Park factory was a loud, rowdy, and raucous place full of nightly sing-alongs around a large organ, gaming, practical jokes, and midnight feasts”) and one half Settlement House (a space where American women, “expropriated the previously male world of literature and the arts as their own, feeling they possessed a special humanistic sensitivity which provided an alternative to the acquisitive and the competitive goals of men in an industrializing America.”).   
  
Yaddo’s guest list is a “whose who” of American Art and letters.  We will, however,  study Yaddo as a compelling introduction to the shifts, evolutions, and challenges to American art across the 20th century; including: the study of politically radical art during the 1930s and a remarkable study of Cold War era political threats to American creativity with a special focus on the Lavender Scare. 
  
Because The Yaddo Records (Yaddo’s archive) are at NYPL, and because I served as project archivist for these records we will also spend a day at NYPL that will include introduction to Yaddo’s archive specifically but also to archives more generally.  Finally, we will be visited (either in person or online) from a variety of Yaddo alum who will share their experiences and impressions and answer student questions etc.",Ben Alexander,5:30pm,8:40pm,10684,,W3699-20252-001,Yaddo: Shaping the Amer C,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3699-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252ENGL3699W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3717,LIT & FILM OF THE BOROUGHS,"Greater New York—the municipality that consolidated the five boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island—was officially established on New Year’s day in 1898.  While the change had been supported by a large majority of the boroughs’ residents in an 1894 referendum, there remained considerable controversy about the enterprise, even by its sponsors.  The city has managed to stave off succession movements since then; however, the boroughs remain resistant to economic, legislative, and cultural consolidation. In this course we will study depictions New York life, from the middle of the 20th century--a time of significant social and political turmoil in many boroughs, particularly around issues of race and religion--and into the 21st.  How do New York’s boroughs themselves become tropes in the fiction and film and television about them?  What characterizes the nostalgia and anxiety about city life in these representations?  Finally, what can an examination of these questions tell us about the ways New York has changed as a locus for imaginative work in the 21st century?
  
Projects for this course will include short critical responses to course materials, a guided walking tour of a micro-neighborhood in NY (5 blocks or less), and a research essay on a film, play, or TV show made and set New York.

ENGL UN3804,British Women Writers: the Woman Questio,"This course will examine British women writers including Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf in the context of the (long-) nineteenth-century ""Woman Question"". Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman’s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of “woman’s nature” in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman’s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between “inward impulse and outward fact”? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: “What does a woman want?”",Aileen G Forbes,1:00pm,4:10pm,10148,,W3804-20252-001,British Women Writers,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3804-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252ENGL3804W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3808,The Novel and Economic Justice,"Global capitalism inspired novelists to explore the ways in which money, or the lack of it, forms or deforms our characters.    It also inspired the writings of Karl Marx, the great theorist of economic justice.  In this seminar we will read three early novels – Behn’s 
Orinooko
, Godwin’s  
Caleb Williams
, Austen’s 
Persuasion
 alongside Marxist theory, and then examine a cluster of twentieth century global novels in English.   We will pay special attention to Marxist notions of materialism; alienation and human flourishing; capital and labor; classes; and ideology.  Special emphasis will also be given to the Marxist approach in the study of culture, the role of intellectuals (such as ourselves) and the relationship between capitalism and culture – through theorists like Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, and Raymond Williams.     
  
The course tracks how key Marxist concepts such as capital and class consciousness, reification, commodification, totality, and alienation have been developed across these traditions and considers how these concepts have been used to rethink literary and mass cultural forms and their ongoing transformation in a changing world system. Writers discussed may include Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Georg Lukács, Mikhail Bakhtin, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Amílcar Cabral, Edward Said, Antonio Gramsci, Raymond Williams, Giovanni Arrighi, Pascale Casanova, David Harvey, and Melinda Cooper.",Ross T Hamilton,5:30pm,8:40pm,10151,,W3808-20252-001,The Novel and Economic Ju,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3808-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252ENGL3808W001,SEMINAR
ENGL W3595,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL: GENRE AND,"In the late seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel.  It told the stories – not of the princes and princesses – but of ordinary people on extraordinary voyages, from villages to the Metropolis, from England to Africa and the Americas. In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century – country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.
  
Why does the novel appear?  What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society?  Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?  To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.  Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen. Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,
 Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.  Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",Ross T Hamilton,1:00pm,4:10pm,10150,,S3595-20252-001,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NO,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3595-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252ENGL3595S001,SEMINAR

What about the time and place that the text was written? This course will introduce students to a range of habits, practices, and approaches to writing about literature and culture that widen and deepen how one can respond to and interpret a novel, a poem, and various other cultural artifacts. At the same time, we will engage in writing practices that empower students to locate and articulate what interests them about a particular piece of writing or culture, to make a claim about it, and to articulate that claim against other interpretations. Foundational to this endeavor is re-envisioning the writing process, from an isolated, individual process to one that involves collaboration and conversation; copious in-class writing; peer workshops; the power of drafts and revision; and the inclusion of research and theoretical frames. We will use Jamaica Kincaid’s novella Lucy as our main text, accompanied by shorter readings and visits to the museum, Barnard library and archive and other excursions that expand the world of our writing and the objects we wish to understand.",Tara Needham,9:30am,12:00pm,00008,,X1000-20252-001,Intro Writing Lit & Cultu,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/X1000-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252ENGP1000X001,LECTURE
ENGP BC1204,CHANGES SPACES AND MOBILITIES: WOMEN IN,"The turn-of-the-century United States was a nation on the cusp of a number of momentous social, cultural, and political movements. One of the biggest changes was in the status and role of women. From the emergence of the New Woman in the last decade of the 19th century, to the suffragette in the 1910s and the flapper in the 1920s, the roles and positions of women were expanding and evolving in unprecedented ways. Coupled with the growth and expansion of cities, women’s mobility and the spaces they occupied changed dramatically during this time period. In this course, we will examine texts that depict the situation of women and their mobility in various social and cultural contexts in the shifting urban landscape of early twentieth-century New York City. What spaces were women allowed/expected to occupy? What spaces were considered taboo or off limits? What were the effects and consequences of the spaces that women occupied? How did women’s mobility differ to men’s? How do race and class impact mobility and space? What factors influenced women’s mobility and how did these factors change/develop over time?

ERMC PS5430,LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT,"Indicators of companies running into hard times typically include revenue volatility, loss of key personnel, reputational damage, and increased litigation. However, company failures are frequently marked by insufficient liquidity, or the lack of cash to meet obligations. Liquidity risk is the unexpected change in a company’s cash resources or demands on such resources that results in the untimely sale of assets, and/or an inability to meet contractual demands and/or default. In extreme cases, the lack of sufficient cash creates severe losses and results in company bankruptcy.
  
An institution’s cash resources and obligations can and must be managed. Indeed, the field of liquidity risk management is an established part of treasury departments at sizable institutions. The regularity of cash flows and the turbulence of business and markets must be assessed and quantified. This course provides students the tools and techniques to manage all types of liquidity challenges including the need to sell assets unexpectedly in the market, or work through ‘‘run‐on-the‐bank’’ situations for financial services companies.",Joseph Dziwura,8:10pm,10:00pm,10839,,K5430-20252-001,,Enterprise Risk Management,ERMC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ERMC/K5430-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20252ERMC5430K001,LECTURE

Via case studies, proprietary materials, class based problem solving exercises, and guest lectures, we will examine and discuss the i) current and future role of the major financial service participants, (ii) key drivers influencing an industry that has always been characterized by significant change (e.g., regulatory, technology, risk, globalization, and client needs), and (iii) challenges and opportunities facing today's financial services' CEOs post the 2008/09 financial crisis. Furthermore, this course is designed for students who want to be financial “architects and leaders”, not financial “technicians”.",Richard Goldberg,4:10pm,6:00pm,10844,,K5515-20252-001,GLOBAL FIN SERV IN THE 21,Enterprise Risk Management,ERMC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ERMC/K5515-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,R,20252ERMC5515K001,LECTURE

FILM GU4045,Augmented Creativity: practical uses of,"We are entering a new age of creativity, where generative AI is transforming how artists and creators work. This course invites undergraduate and graduate students at Columbia's School of the Arts to explore the powerful intersection of AI and creative practice. Through hands-on experimentation with AI tools—ranging from large language models (LLMs) to image and video generators—students will unlock new creative potential across ideation, visual development, and storytelling.
  
The course emphasizes how AI can augment existing creative methods, from generating ideas and developing personas to blending AI with traditional storytelling techniques. Students will also critically engage with the ethical implications of using AI in art. Culminating in a speculative design project, this course prepares students to envision and prototype the future of creative practice, where AI becomes a true collaborator in the artistic process.",,9:00am,12:10pm,11273,,S4045-20252-001,Augmented Creativity: AI,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S4045-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252FILM4045S001,WORKSHOP

But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms.

FILM UN3024,Horror Movies and New York,"In 1933’s 
King Kong
, the titular giant ape is brought to New York City in chains—he is brought to Broadway, becoming an object of spectacle for the gaping crowds. Film scholar James Snead describes the film as an “allegory of the slave trade… and of various other forms of exploitation and despoilment.” Snead finds in the monster movie gestures towards the fears of an emancipated Black America as represented by the Harlem Renaissance and even, with its climax at the very top of the Empire State Building, a critique of American Capitalism. How the scholar uncovers, in 
King Kong, 
anxieties about the city and the wider American experience, emblematizes the ‘against-the-grain’ approach of this class which asks: what kind of subterranean views of New York City and its taboo/unseen histories emerge when we look deep into the shadows of the horror genre?
  
Our eye will move across the city as well as across film and media history, plunging from the heights of King Kong’s looming skyscraper to Greenwich Village where murderers lurk among our neighbors (
Rear Window
). We will move from the macabre world of a cruel, sometimes demonic upper class (
American Psycho
, 
Rosemary’s Baby
) to the gay cruising scene of the 1970s menaced by slashers who may be hiding in the dancing crowd (
Cruising
).
  
With its emphasis on field trips, the course will offer a holistic view of an iconic yet always changing city with visits to the top of the Empire State Building and to the Museum of Reclaimed Space. There, we will gain lessons on gentrification’s costs as well as strategies to resist its insidiously flattening force. For our week on Roman Polanski’s 
Rosemary’s Baby
, we will visit the setting of the Dakota Hotel, mulling how the film about a woman who may be giving birth to an otherworldly creature visualizes urban space as a place of profound disconnection. It will mobilize the archival resources of Columbia’s collections around the featured films, so students can appreciate how New York-based critics perceived these films’ representations of the city. To further frame how horror can be a space to explore unsung histories and the impacts of ongoing cultural traumas, acclaimed artists will be invited into the classroom. These include: Pornsak Pichetshote whose graphic novel 
Infidel
 presents the prejudices, paranoias, and fears of post-9/11 New York in a monstruous light a",Fareed Ben-Youssef,1:00pm,4:10pm,10597,,S3024-20252-001,Horror Movies and New Yor,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3024-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252FILM3024S001,SEMINAR
FILM UN3025,Narrative Design for Games and Interacti,"Traditionally, stories have followed a linear path, with a clear distinction between teller and audience. Yet, since the late 20th century, this model is shifting. Today, postmodern fiction, video games, interactive films, VR, participatory theater and immersive experiences offer audiences agency, creating a challenge for creators: how do they uphold narrative integrity while allowing for choice, collaboration, and remixing?
  
In this class, we’ll examine how modern narrative designers craft stories across media that invite audience participation. Through history, analysis, and workshops, we’ll explore how creators design for interaction while preserving tone and themes, turning audiences into active participants.
  
For the final assignment, students will develop a 12-15 minute pitch presentation for an original story concept, adapting it into an interactive format that balances strong authorial vision with audience agency.",Nick Braccia,1:00pm,4:10pm,10598,,S3025-20252-001,Narr Design for Games & I,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3025-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252FILM3025S001,SEMINAR
FILM UN3045,Film Criticism & Story Development,"Criticism is an important skill to have, to appreciate and understand film more. But criticism isn’t black and white, and most importantly, it can help inform us of how to shape, tell, and develop a story that resonates with the audience.
  
This course will begin by exploring the basics of film criticism and film appreciation, as students develop their skills in analyzing and identifying components that make a film work (or fall short). As they approach the second half of the course, students will transform their skills in critiquing into productive feedback and use what they’ve learned to form and develop stories of their own, write a 1-2 page treatment, and finally pitch their story ideas in front of the class.
  
Everyone is interested in telling a story, but through the lens of film criticism, students will appreciate the creative process and learn how it is empowered by what we watch and most importantly, how we watch. Students will use this summer course to identify and prepare for areas of focus that they might be interested in pursuing (screenwriting, directing, producing) in their academic career.",Kevin L Lee,2:00pm,5:10pm,10627,,S3045-20252-001,Film Criticism & Story De,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3045-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252FILM3045S001,SEMINAR

At the conclusion of the course, the student will have gained an appreciation for the role M&A plays on today's corporate landscape and have formed an opinion as to whether or not an M&A transaction makes sense"" for the firm. The student should expect at the conclusion of this course to have gained a level of competency in M&A commensurate with an entry-level investment banking associate in M&A. Whether or not the student ""practices"" M&A, the course will afford the student with an insider's look into what is an undeniable major force on today's corporate landscape. Accordingly, students who are interested in investment banking, consulting, equity research, corporate development, corporate lending, strategic planning, private equity, leveraged finance, or proprietary trading many wish to consider this course.""",Donna M Hitscherich,9:00am,5:00pm,10979,,B8325-20252-001,,Finance,FINC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8325-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

Prerequisite: 4-5 semesters of French language study or the equivalent. 
  
French cinema is characterized by its artistic richness, its vigor and, above all, its diversity. This film history course will function as a journey in which we explore contemporary French cinema. Our itinerary will take us from the 1990s, those of “young French cinema” and neoclassicism, to the end of the 2010s, those of directors like Julie Delpy and Christophe Honoré. Together, we will develop a panorama in which the works of Cédric Klapisch and Nicole Garcia will intersect, as well as those of Céline Sciamma and Arnaud Desplechin.
  
The objective of this course will be to introduce students to French cinema, its history and its diversity. We will also have the chance to correlate academic knowledge and practical experience, so as to give the students a significant idea of French film activity. The application process is competitive and will take place onsite in February.

Columbia Summer Global Core: The Athens
 
Experience
 examines the way particular spaces—cultural, urban, literary—serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on nationalism and the theme of the 
polis
 (the city) as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. What understandings of Greek culture, society, and environment emerge from cartography, scientific expeditions, archaeological excavations, and, more recently, economic and artistic commissions? In what ways does the idea of crisis (economic, environmental, public health) shape understandings of Greek everyday life and cultural production today? We will engage in a historically informed study of the “right now” and learn through collaborative work, cross-media exploration, and a project-based approach. The program will be structured around the Global Core course  
Hellenism and the Topographical Imagination
 and will consist of classroom seminars centered on the study and discussion of texts, films, and cultural artifacts; site visits, fieldtrips, and walking tours; and workshop sessions, all of which will prepare students for this year’s final project—curating a permanent exhibition in the new Athens Global Center examining the neoclassical building’s important place in the capital’s cultural and political life.

HIST BC2199,A History of Witchcraft and Magic in Eur,"This lecture course examines the social, cultural, and legal history of witchcraft, magic, and the occult throughout European history. We will examine the values and attitudes that have influenced beliefs about witchcraft and the supernatural, both historically and in the present day, using both primary and secondary sources. This course will pay specific attention to the role of gender and sexuality in the history of witchcraft, as the vast majority of individuals charged in the witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were indeed women. We will also study accusations of witchcraft, breaking down the power dynamics and assumptions at play behind the witch trials, and the impacts of these trials on gender relations in European society. This class will track the intersections of magic and science throughout the early-modern period, and the reconciliation of belief systems during the Enlightenment. We will carry our analysis into the modern period, touching on Victorian spiritualism and mysticism, McCarthyism in the United States, and contemporary goddess worship.

HIST GU4112,The European Enlightenment,"This course aims to introduce students to classic and more recent literature on the intellectual and cultural history of the Enlightenment. The field has expanded far beyond the cohort of free-thinking 
philosophes
 around which it was initially conceived to encompass broader cultural, economic, and religious preoccupations. Given these tendencies, how has the significance of the Enlightenment shifted as a historical period and interpretive framework? In what ways do scholars explicate its origins, outcomes, and legacies? The readings trace the development of Enlightenment thought and practices from their early manifestations in Britain and the United Provinces before shifting attention to France, the geographical focal point of the movement by mid-century. Topics to be addressed include the relationship of traditional political authorities to an emerging public sphere, the invention of society as a means of mediating human relationships, the entrepreneurial and epistemological innovations made possible by new media, the struggles of the 
philosophe
 movement for legitimacy, debates surrounding luxury consumption and commercial society, the rise of political economy as field of knowledge and practical platform, and arguments between Christian apologists and radical atheists over the status of religious truth.",Charly J Coleman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10552,,W4112-20252-001,The European Enlightenmen,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W4112-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252HIST4112W001,SEMINAR

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10191,,S3116-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S3116-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20252HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the 
Global Core
 requirement, which is reflected on the Columbia online registry.  The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits. Finally, the course is regularly

The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties.

Questions to be addressed include:  the development of the modern concept of ""religion"" and its effect on the Jews; the origin of the notion of ""Judaism"" parallel to Christianity, Islam, etc.; the rise of Jewish secularism and of secular Jewish ideologies, especially the Jewish Enlightenment movement (Haskalah), modern Jewish nationalism, and Zionism; the rise of Reform, Modern Orthodox, and Conservative Judaisms; Jewish neo-Romanticism and neo-Kantianism, and American Jewish religious thought.",Michael F Stanislawski,1:00pm,4:10pm,10201,,Q3644-20252-001,MOD JEWISH INTELLECTUAL H,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stanislawski,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/Q3644-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252HIST3644Q001,SEMINAR
HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

Part of the Core Curriculum since 1947, Music Humanities aims to instill in students a basic comprehension of the many forms of the Western musical imagination. Its specific goals are to awaken and encourage in students an appreciation of music in the Western world, to help them learn to respond intelligently to a variety of musical idioms, and to engage them in the various debates about the character and purposes of music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since ancient times. The course attempts to involve students actively in the process of critical listening, both in the classroom and in concerts that the students attend and write about.

IKNS PS5301,Strategic Consulting for Knowledge-based,"The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with the typical phases of an internal or external consulting project. The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,  phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A  typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor/client  relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a  variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or  product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and  the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and  proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.
  
Successful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the  client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on  the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to  work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual  and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing  expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability  to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.  During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,  processes, and social factors that promote successful change.
  
This course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external  organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives. No  prerequisites.",Edward J Hoffman,8:10pm,10:00pm,10786,,K5301-20252-D01,STRATGIC CONSLTNG FOR KNW,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5301-20252-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Architecture

IKNS PS5988,Human-Centered Design for Data-Driven St,"Within this course, students will explore how practices from human-centered design (HCD) can be applied to the end-to-end data science workflow—problem (use case) definition, data collection & preparation, data exploration, data modeling, and communicating and visualizing the results— in order to build trust in data that is used to drive strategy and decision making and impact organizational change. Students will learn about fundamental human values and how methods from the behavioral sciences and HCD can inspire ethical use of data to drive strategy and change in the modern, data-driven workplace. Students will understand how keeping “humans in the loop” is beneficial, and they will develop a critical eye for assessing whether the data they rely on to make decisions at work is human-centric, particularly as we become more reliant on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to inform our insights, strategies, and decision making at work.
  
 Content & Goals: Through hands-on, project-based work, students will work individually and in project teams to practice designing human-centric information and communication experiences, leveraging audience-focused data visualizations and storytelling techniques to drive a strategic workplace objective, motivating leaders and employees into action to create traceable organizational impact that benefits people. Students will have an opportunity to practice their writing and presentation skills through practical course assignments.
  
 Logistics: This graduate-level elective course is designed for students in Information & Knowledge Strategy but is open to other students at Columbia University. This course would be relevant to students studying management and technology more broadly. The course will be delivered in person on Columbia’s campus during the spring semester.

In this uncertain political climate, it is even more important to understand global institutions, their strengths and weaknesses and how they function.

With a particular focus on the actions (or lack thereof) of the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and diverse international judicial institutions like the International Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court, the course will illustrate, through practical case studies, the inherent challenges associated with the protection of human dignity, the enforcement of human rights and the fight against impunity.",David Marshall,5:30pm,8:40pm,10086,,S6552-20252-001,UNITED NATIONS & HUMAN RI,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6552-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252INTL6552S001,LECTURE
INTL S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10091,,S6559-20252-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6559-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252INTL6559S001,SEMINAR

From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication.

This course is intended primarily for beginning students who have no prior knowledge of Classical Japanese (bungo 文語 / kobun 古文 / kogo 古語, etc.). It is designed to give students a systematic and intensive introduction to the grammar of classical Japanese. Texts are taken mainly from the Heian and medieval periods, though texts from later periods will also be introduced. It is expected that by the end of the course students will have acquired a firm foundation in classical Japanese grammar and will be able to read classical Japanese texts with the aid of a dictionary. Students will generally find that they also have an improved grasp of modern Japanese grammar and will also gain experience in using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries. The course will also include some instruction in reading cursive Japanese, primarily variant kana (hentaigana).

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them.

MENA OC4100,"Migration, Displacement and Diaspora in","MENA4100OC: Migration, Displacement and Diaspora in the Contemporary Mediterranean. 3 points. 
  
This course counts as a 
Global Core Requirement
 at Columbia University.  
  
This course examines the social, political and cultural history of migration in the Mediterranean, with a particular focus on France and Africa. We examine the forces that have underpinned migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political, social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between
 politics and the arts.

 is required of MS students until all requirements (including the Thesis) have been completed. Continuous registration means the student must be registered each and every semester or, he or she must be on an official leave of absence. If continuous registration is not maintained, the student must apply for readmission to the Graduate School. ‘Continuous Registration’ includes summer sessions.
  
Students can satisfy the continuous registration requirement and maintain their current status by registering for Matriculation and Facilities (MTCF9751), allowing them access to all University facilities.  It is important for students to request leaves of absence in writing for any term in which they will be away from the University. This may be for reasons of ill health, maternity or paternity leave, military service, or other reasons deemed to be acceptable for leave by the University. If a student does not officially request a leave of absence and does not register for a semester, the student MUST apply for readmission to the University before registration is allowed.  Prior to submitting the leave of absence form, students must meet with their advisor to discuss academic progress, plans, and leave. Students should understand that taking a leave during the period in which the Department has offered support may result in a loss of funding. To request a leave of absence, submit the completed Leave of Absence form, available online at

MUSI GU4135,Opera in Venice,"MUSI4135OC: Opera in Venice. 3 Points.
  
Prerequisites: None
  
Instructor: Giuseppe Gerbino
  
Opera as we know it was born in Venice. After an early phase of private operatic experiments under the patronage of courts and aristocratic academies, the first public opera house, the San Cassiano Theater, opened its doors in Venice in 1637. As a commercial enterprise, opera rapidly came to dominate the social and cultural life of the city, as Venice grew into one of the most influential and strangely seductive European capitals of music.
  
The course traces the Venetian history of opera from its origins to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Students will also have an opportunity to explore the legacy of this tradition in contemporary Venice as well as in the twentieth-century construction of a nostalgic image of the city’s past musical splendor. Instruction will focus on the relationship between the unique political and topographical organization of Venice and the development of opera. The syllabus integrates academic training with activities designed to allow students to take full advantage of Venice’s historical and cultural resources, including live musical performances, museum visits, and workshops on the workings of Venice’s historical theaters.

NECR PS5107,Organizational Conflict and Mediation,"This required NECR course will introduce the concepts and skills of mediation, a type of third-party conflict intervention. This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict.

NECR PS5202,APPLIED CONFLICT RESOLUTION: FROM THEORY,"This course explores the intersection of theory and practice in conflict resolution, giving students the opportunity to apply theories, models, and frameworks to real world scenarios. Students will analyze case studies, review current events, and bring to bear their own experiences in international, organizational, community and interpersonal conflicts in an interactive setting as they continue to develop and hone their critical thinking and conflict analysis skills. 
  
Drawing from the disciplines of social and clinical psychology, political and organizational sciences, and international relations, conflict resolution practitioners have at their disposal a wealth of research that can inform their analysis of a situation and how to assist parties to mitigate, de-escalate and prevent conflict.
  
Participants in this class engage with the course readings, instructors, and each other to critically analyze and deconstruct complex conflicts in a variety of contexts. A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Applying conflict resolution constructs and frameworks such as interdependence, intergroup conflict, social identity, bias, peacebuilding, power dynamics, culture, and negotiation frameworks, are among the key learnings integrated into the course.
  
The competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life.

NECR PS5210,CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEM,"Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) is a methodology developed in the hard sciences to understand complex systems—from the weather to the functioning of cells, using mathematical algorithms. We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",Camilo Azcarate,9:00am,5:00pm,11023,,K5210-20252-001,CONF RESOLUTION/DYNAMIC S,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5210-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,MTW,20252NECR5210K001,LECTURE

NECR PS5250,Open Source Intelligence: Research for C,"The elective ""Open Source Intelligence: Research for Conflict Analysis""
 
course is designed to introduce students to key practical insights, tips, and professional skills necessary for any successful conflict resolution practitioner. In this course, students will be required to practically apply some of the tools and techniques of NECR, and appreciate the importance of combining and reformulating the basic NECR concepts in order to serve their exact needs in the field. 
  
Through this course, students have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the classroom, learn additional practical research skills, and adjust them to their own very specific professional aspirations in the field. This course also helps students strategize their next professional steps in the field in a concise, methodical way. 
  
It is important to keep in mind that the Conflict Resolution field at large is quite diverse, and our students have unique backgrounds and future aspirations. Therefore, this course is customized in coordination with each student during 1-on-1 sessions that take place at the beginning of the semester, in order for each student to be working on something that is clear, and has practical value for his/her very specific professional interests. 
  
As with many things in life, proactiveness, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit are keys to success for our very challenging field.  Each student will be having a required 1-on-1 session with the instructor, where the instructor will help the student explore ways to creatively strategize their next professional steps as practitioners and also develop the instructions for the final paper that match the needs of the student.

NECR PS5270,Social Justice and Conflict Resolution i,"NECR 5270 is a three-credit summer practicum course designed to expose students to the role of social justice in conflict resolution analysis and practice, using New York City as our laboratory. Each summer, we will focus on a single, challenging question facing NYC at the intersection of conflict resolution and social justice, including how to respond to gang violence, how to address inequality, how to manage immigration and more. Within the chosen topic, we will explore the historical and theoretical intersections between the fields of social justice and conflict resolution, drawing on our conflict analysis and resolution skills to explore concrete policy options and community strategies. The course builds on the historical connection between conflict resolution and social justice, particularly as it emerged during the civil rights movement, where nonviolent resistance and negotiation were used to challenge systemic oppression. It also draws on the foundational work of Morton Deutsch at Columbia University, whose research on cooperation, competition, and social justice highlights how power imbalances can perpetuate conflict. Through critical dialogue, case study analysis, and practitioner-led workshops, students will develop culturally sensitive, sustainable, and community-centered.
  
We will focusing on needs-based strategies for addressing gang violence in New York City, while critically examining the role of bias in our work as conflict resolution scholars and practitioners. Students will analyze the social, economic, and psychological factors that drive individuals toward gang involvement, and learn about gang structures and the role of gang rivalries in driving crime. In addition to classroom learning, students will participate in fieldwork designed to expose them to experts, policymakers, activists, and practitioners working directly on issues related to gang violence in New York City. These immersive experiences will offer opportunities to engage with real-world challenges while critically reflecting on how biases—both personal and systemic—affect the implementation of violence prevention strategies and conflict resolution efforts. Fieldwork activities may include visits to local violence prevention programs, meetings with law enforcement officials focused on reducing bias in community engagement, and discussions with activists leading restorative justice initiatives. By integrating theoretical knowledge with practical experiences, students will be equipped to design innovative, needs",Peter Dixon,6:10pm,8:00pm,11026,,K5270-20252-001,Social Justice & Conflict,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5270-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

Introduction to Negotiation, the course provides students with many
 
opportunities to understand the interpersonal dynamics of conflict and to
 
practice the skills of negotiation, mediation, and facilitation.
  
 
To intervene as skilled practitioners, conflict-resolution professionals

narratives influence both sides’ perception, emotions, and responses. As a
 
result of their reflective practice, students can learn to make more
 
strategic choices as negotiators, mediators, and facilitators.

NOPM PS5175,INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT: MANAGEMENT & PE,"This course examines how international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) can and often do contribute to social change, confronting and addressing various problems such as poverty, human rights violations, conflict, and climate change, among others. Students will leave with a deep appreciation of what it means to work in or with an advocacy-based NGOs. The course will help prepare them for future careers as an NGO leader, staff person, consultant, analyst, donor, or manager. Students will understand how NGOs are structured and the definition and differences between key concepts such as strategy, theory of change, governance, leadership, management, and program design.
  
The course will bring a scholar-practitioner perspective focusing on debates about strategy development, measuring impact, donor strategies, theories of change, institutional representation, diversity and equity, ethics, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement, campaigning, capacity-building, fundraising, resilience, sustainability, and external and internal communications.
  
The course will explore distinctions, similarities, and relationships among nongovernmental (national and international), government, and private actors as they seek to solve problems and have impact and create a better world. Throughout this exploration, we will identify major ethical issues raised by the very notions of charity, philanthropy and nonprofits. As a focus, the course will especially draw on examples from the international human rights movement, and often critically employ a “donor perspective” to draw out the hard strategic choices that INGOs (and their donors) are compelled to make. The course will also use documentary film about INGOs and their work, and various media produced about and by INGOs to help provide additional understanding.
  
The course will be discussion intensive and require students to utilize and reflect critical and analytical thinking; students will write individual papers, participate in group presentations, write occasional reflection papers, actively participate in discussion both in class and through postings on Canvas and present material to classroom colleagues.
  
This is an elective course in the M.S. Nonprofit Management Program and will be open, space permitting,  to cross-registrants.
  
The course will draw on material from the management course offered as part of the core curriculum.

NOPM PS5350,Leading with Purpose: Advocacy and Strat,"In an era defined by unprecedented global challenges and opportunities, nonprofit advocacy serves as a powerful force for systemic reform and public innovation. This course immerses students in the intersection of theory and practice through an 
advocacy practicum
 approach—designed to equip future nonprofit leaders with the skills to influence policy, mobilize communities, and drive systemic change.
  
In the context of the ever evolving policy landscape of New York City and providing a global lens, this course offers an in-depth exploration of advocacy fundamentals within the nonprofit sector. Through real-world case studies, hands-on projects, and interactive fieldwork, students have the opportunity to examine how advocacy efforts in New York City—a hub of civic engagement—can expand broader policy frameworks and cross into international contexts.
  
Over the term, students will explore the theoretical foundations of advocacy, including social movement theory, policy influence, and public opinion formation. They will engage in stakeholder analysis, coalition-building, and the creation of advocacy strategies tailored to shifting political, economic, and social dynamics. Central to this course will be discussions on how traditional advocacy approaches are being redefined in response to growing inequalities and systemic challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptable, intersectional strategies to confront global disparities.
  
The framework emphasizes practical application: students will have the opportunity to develop and implement real advocacy plans, leveraging digital tools, media, and virtual organizing strategies to enhance their impact. Fieldwork, simulations, and collaborative projects will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to tangible issues, empowering them to lead efforts that address pressing social challenges, whether locally in New York City or globally in areas such as international development and human rights.
  
Key topics include:
  
  
Crafting advocacy strategies that influence public policy in divided political environments;
  
Building and managing coalitions across stakeholders;
  
Engaging marginalized communities to ensure inclusive and equitable advocacy efforts;
  
Navigating the digital advocacy landscape to design impactful campaigns.

PHIL S3601,METAPHYSICS,"This course will survey topics in contemporary metaphysics. We will focus on material objects, time, modality, causation, properties, and natural kinds. We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds. The section will conclude with problems about the metaphysics of socially constructed kinds such as race or gender.",Noah Betz-Richman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10119,,S3601-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),PHIL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHIL/S3601-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252PHIL3601S001,LECTURE
PHIL S3751,POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY,"Six major concepts of political philosophy including authority, rights, equality, justice, liberty and democracy are examined in three different ways.

Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau. Third some attention is paid to relevant contexts of application of these concepts in political society, including such political movements as anarchism, international human rights, conservative, liberal, and Marxist economic policies as well as competing models of democracy.",Joseph Hamilton,1:00pm,4:10pm,10180,,S3751-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),PHIL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHIL/S3751-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252PHIL3751S001,LECTURE

The principles, theories, and rationales for the use of physical modalities will be presented primarily in lecture format. Laboratory sessions include hands-on experiences with physical modalities, role-playing with peers, and case discussions. The emphasis of laboratory is to practice skills on normal individuals and to become competent in administering the examination and intervention techniques associated with the application of physical modalities. Students will be expected to apply information from previous or concurrent coursework to critically analyze a variety of clinical scenarios during case discussions. Clinical reasoning will be fostered and emphasized through all the learning experiences within this course.",,,,11480,,M8310-20252-081,,Physical Therapy,PHYT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHYT/M8310-20252-081/,,In-Person,Physical Therapy,1,,,20252PHYT8310M081,HYBRID ONLIN

Students will develop manual skills required to perform safe and effective soft tissue interventions in any clinical setting.
  
Soft tissue mobilization has been a part of manual medicine for millennia. This course introduces the theory, evidence, and practice of several common forms of soft tissue mobilization. The class begins with traditional massage that rely on basic theory and progresses to advanced techniques based on principles derived from current fascial theory. Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply soft tissue mobilizations that impact musculoskeletal system impairment of the upper-extremity, lower- extremity, and trunk. Along the way, students apply evidence-based practice concepts and knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, soft tissue pathophysiology in the experiential learning and discussion-based learning approach. Ultimately, students will be able to make logical clinical decisions that integrate soft tissue mobilization into an effective plan of care. Significant out-of-laboratory practice time is required to develop the manual skills for safe, effective, and professional soft tissue mobilizations in any clinical setting.",,,,11481,,M8315-20252-081,,Physical Therapy,PHYT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHYT/M8315-20252-081/,,In-Person,Physical Therapy,1,,,20252PHYT8315M081,LECTURE

Students will begin by reviewing in the first week of the course the basic science of Climate Change and then studying the roots of our understanding of nature, including a variety of ancient religious texts and a wide range of Creation Narratives from around the globe. The second week of the course will be an introduction to a critical examination of artistic responses to Climate Change in recent decades. This will include Land Art that questions and tests our control over the landscape, a century of films that feature natural disaster scenarios, dystopian poems and short stories, music that seeks to represent the challenges of climate change in the auditory dimension, paintings and sculptures that visualize global warming, and performance art that uses the human body to dramatize the ways in we have been transforming nature.

This seminar will consider how capital, gender, race, culture, and power shape understandings of Wall Street in the popular imagination, and how people’s everyday practices reshape that understanding. Drawing on a variety of texts –anthropological, sociological, political-economic, historical, literary, and cinematic – we will examine the ways new forms of capital produce financial subjects, class difference, and crisis, within the global economy. We will also explore the ways Occupy Wall Street, Me Too, Black Lives Matter and other social movements are recapturing the radical imagination and the possibilities of new forms of resistance to capitalism that often intersect with sexism, racism, and other systems of power. Using interdisciplinary methodologies such as fieldwork, archival research, and literary analysis students will produce short papers and one research paper that allows them to take advantage of conducting research in New York City.",,9:30am,12:00pm,00090,,S1004-20252-001,WALL STREET AND PCF,Pre-College Program (Barnard),POLP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLP/S1004-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252POLP1004S001,SEMINAR

The topics we will study include what courts do; how different legal systems function; the operation of legal norms; the U.S. judicial system; the power of courts; constraints on judicial power; judicial review; the origin of judicial institutions; how and why Supreme Court justices make the decisions they do; case selection; conflict between the Court and the other branches of government; decision making and conflict within the judicial hierarchy; the place of courts in American political history; and judicial appointments.
  
We will explore some common but not necessarily true claims about how judges make decisions and the role of courts.  One set of myths sees judges as unbiased appliers of neutral law, finding law and never making it, with ideology, biography, and politics left at the courthouse door. Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the “least dangerous branch,” making law, not policy, without real power or influence.

The course examines the phenomenon of hallucinations, in which the brain creates perceptual experiences that do not correspond to external sensory input. To explore this phenomenon, students will engage with a variety of media—such as podcasts, documentaries, and memoirs—alongside scholarly articles from fields like cognitive neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology. Drawing on case studies centered on the lived experience of hallucinations, we will investigate how key theories of the mind and brain influence the interpretation of first-person accounts and how, in turn, these accounts challenge and refine these theories. Guest lectures will enhance the case studies by presenting current and future directions in hallucination research. By integrating interdisciplinary academic research with first-person perspectives, this course offers students the opportunity to critically examine how knowledge of the mind and brain is constructed and how it can be applied in real-world contexts.

PSYC S3472,Psychedelic Neuroscience: From Molecules,"Psychedelics are receiving growing attention in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience for their therapeutic potential. Psychedelic compounds like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT produce a wide range of changes to perception, ranging from visual perception to alterations in one’s sense of self. When combined with psychological support or psychotherapy, psychedelics have been shown to lead to rapid and long-lasting therapeutic benefits for a wide range of mental health disorders, including major depression and alcohol use disorder. The acute alterations in perception and long-lasting clinical effects offer exciting insight into the relationship between the mind and the brain. This course will focus on the current state of research on the psychological and neurobiological effects of psychedelics. We will begin with a crash-course into the basics of neuroscience and research methodology. Next, the course will delve into how psychedelics alter brain functioning, both acutely during the drug effects as well as long after they have worn off. Studies covered will span molecular, cellular, and systems level analysis. A core element of the course will include reviewing methodological approaches and neuroscientific evidence for psychedelics interventions in the treatment of clinical/psychiatric disorders. We will also review the clinical data and link neurobiological findings to their practical application to move the field of psychedelic science forward. Throughout the course, there will be a specific focus on critical appraisal of research, identifying strengths and limitations surrounding current research, and important avenues for future research. Students should leave the class with an enhanced ability to evaluate research findings and a broad understanding of the mechanisms of action of psychedelics.
  
The format of the course will include lectures, class discussions and presentations, and guest speakers.

PSYC S4655,"The science of me, you and us:  insights","Why do we feel the way we do, how do we understand ourselves and others, and how does this relate to our social relationships?  Why does all of this sometimes leave us feeling anxious, depressed, lonely and isolated?  And when that happens, what we can do about it?  In this seminar, we will tackle these questions using an integrative approach that blends social psychology, clinical psychology and neuroscience to uncover how our emotions and social interactions sometimes work well and sometimes falter.  To do this, we will examine human behavior at multiple levels, connecting our social and emotional lives (what we experience and how we act) to cognitive processes (how our minds process information) and underlying neural mechanisms (what's happening in the brain).  As the semester unfolds, we start by building an understanding of where our emotions come from, how we can manage them, how we make sense of other people and how we can form positive connections with them.  This knowledge provides a foundation for taking the next step - understanding what happens when things go awry and we end up with momentary - or long-lasting - bouts of anxiety, depression, loneliness and other clinical conditions.  We end by considering what may be everyone’s life goal - the pursuit of happiness - and how everything we have learned can foster that pursuit through personal actions, social connections and psychotherapeutic support.  The overarching goal is to build a nuanced understanding of how and why we think and feel the way we do – about ourselves and others – that can inform both scientific and personal explorations of what “wellbeing” and “mental health” means.

PUBH P6032,RESEARCH METHODS & APPLICATIONS,"Successful public health studies, policies, and interventions rely on evidence to guide their design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Because public health is not a simple, reactive, “take the pill three times a day” solution, but a purposeful approach to preventing disease and promoting health, the tools of scientific inquiry to document, measure, evaluate, and understand all the consequences of health interventions are essential. Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed.

QMSS GR5075,Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Social Sc,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI – like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Gemini – are poised to change the world for everyone. It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class – through readings and a dozen hands-on activities – students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI’s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people’s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI’s “weirdness.” Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills – like in critical thinking and empathy – in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, “So far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1/36th of the time, thanks to AI. AI is wild!"" By the end of this class, students will feel empowered technically and philosophically to handle all new generative AI developments. There are no specific prerequisites for this class.",Gregory M Eirich,9:00am,12:10pm,10531,,G5075-20252-001,AI and Social Science,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5075-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252QMSS5075G001,LECTURE

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ).

How do we relate to those who are different from us, and what does it mean to be a community in the first place?

The Doctrine of Discovery is the defining legal rationale for European Colonization in the Western Hemisphere.

These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class.

SPAN BC3305,Sustainable Communities in Ecuador: What,"Indigenous people in Ecuador, which represent about 7% of the Ecuadorian population (United Nations, 2015), are disproportionately poor compared with the rest of the population. In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution. Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis. 
  
The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.  It aims to:
  
1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.
  
2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.
  
3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.
  
4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.
  
5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",Maria E Lozano,,,00083,,X3305-20252-001,SUSTAINABLE COMMUN.

SUMA PS5020,COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS,"This course is about cost-benefit analysis and the economic evaluations of policies and projects. Cost benefit analysis (CBA) consists of a comprehensive set of techniques used to evaluate government programs. It is now routinely applied in such program areas as transportation, water projects, health, training and education, criminal justice, environmental protection, urban policy and even in the international arena such as foreign direct investment. Many of the techniques of CBA can also be applied to private sector decision-making. The objective of CBA is to determine whether the benefits of a particular program, policy or decision outweigh its costs. The techniques used to determine this are sometimes quite simple, but on other, increasingly frequent occasions are highly sophisticated. Sophisticated cost benefit studies are based on a framework that utilizes the basic concepts of economic theory. In addition, statistical and econometric analyses are often needed to estimate program effects from diverse available data. The course has two parts: methodology and practice. The goal is for students to be practically adept to undertake an independent cost-benefit analysis.",Alexander Heil,6:10pm,8:00pm,10875,,K5020-20252-001,,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5020-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252SUMA5020K001,LECTURE

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.  Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked “experts only.”  The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.  Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",Lucius J Riccio,6:10pm,8:00pm,10878,,K5033-20252-001,DECISION MODELS & MGMT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5033-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252SUMA5033K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.
  
Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.
  
This course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis.

It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.
  
To understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm.

overextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast
  
technological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of
  
the disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a “take-make’-
  
waste” manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our
  
planet’s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological
  
advancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;
  
which begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?
  
The premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative
  
economic future are available to us. By looking at resources’ potential, we can shape alternative methods
  
of procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,
  
products and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into
  
both the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and
  
restoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications
  
required in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially
  
transformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic
  
structures, systems and processes.
  
This is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability
  
leaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us
  
(as rapidly as we need) into a more sustaining future. The class will be comprised of a series of lectures,
  
supported by readings and case-studies on business models, design thinking and materi",Diana A Trushell,4:10pm,6:00pm,11080,,K5470-20252-001,CIRC ECON FOR SUST PROFS,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5470-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252SUMA5470K001,LECTURE

What is Creative Writing For? Prose Writing in Paris
, 3 credits. 
Instructor:  
Nellie Hermann
, Adjunct Associate Professor, Barnard College; Core Faculty, Narrative Medicine; Creative Director, Columbia Narrative Medicine; Course Director, Narrative Medicine Certificate.
  
This course will plot a journey through a series of themes designed to examine what creative writing might be 
for
 as an applied practice (not only as an art): how can the tools of creative work connect us more deeply to the world around us, and therefore potentially transform any other endeavor we take on? Throughout the month, we will write and read – each week will feature a few different texts (all of them by French writers or by writers who lived in Paris)  which will form the background of the week’s work, and a particular piece of prose writing will be due at the end of that week. We will rely heavily on the city of Paris to be our teacher and guide in these various themes, and will involve the city in our explorations. In addition to the reading and generative exercises through each week, students will share one longer-form piece of writing with the group, and we will spend at least four class sessions workshopping these pieces as a group, with formal workshop letters due from students to underscore the attention they are giving to each other’s work.  
This course counts toward the Medical Humanities Major at Columbia University.

At least since the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos called ""painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks,"" creative writing has existed in conversation with a variety of other art forms, particularly visual art. In this class, we will explore creative writing as an interdisciplinary practice, with an emphasis on the work of artists who create in both the visual and textual fields. Among other key critical questions, we will consider:
  
1. How has an intersection with visual art been important to creative writing historically?
  
2. How does visual experience relate to particular aspects of creative writing?
  
3. How can we use visual art towards our own creative process in the future, either by using visual art in writing or by incorporating illustration in the presentation of our written work?
  
A mix of texts—classic and contemporary poetry and prose, illuminated manuscripts, children’s picturebooks, literature that we might consider 
visually-driven
, and related scholarship­­––form the basis for our investigations, discussions, and creative work.

WRIT S4313,WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS,"There are many misconceptions as to what makes an appealing story for children and how to get a story published. Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",Peter Catalanotto,10:00am,1:10pm,10517,,S4313-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Catalanotto,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4313-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT4313S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,5:30pm,8:40pm,10518,,S4320-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4320-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252WRIT4320S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"The Young Adult (YA) publishing boom has changed the way we read—and write—coming-of-age stories. This course will introduce students to the elements that shape YA novels, and explore the fiction writing techniques needed for long projects, including narrative arcs, character construction, worldbuilding, and scene work. We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",Emily K Austin,10:00am,1:10pm,10146,,S4323-20252-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4323-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4324,MISFITS AND MISANTHROPES,"People like to be liked. And writers obsess about likability in fiction. But is it that important? What about visionaries, iconoclasts, stragglers, strangers, weirdos, and cringe-inducers? What happens when there is friction between a person and their surroundings? Between people? What if a character throws aside motivations to be liked and impulses to comply?
  
At its heart, this is a class focused on analyzing and crafting characters. We’ll look at loners and lonely hearts, articulate big mouths, and introverted self-imploders. We’ll observe their circumstances and question how their desires encourage them to think and act. Students will regularly respond to prompts and workshop their own writing.
  
Our discussions will consider what choices writers make to render, shape, define, and refine characters. We’ll take on craft-oriented concerns such as: How is dialogue used to differentiate characters? How does a writer demonstrate a character’s compassion, even if their attitude stinks? How do the story's events affect the reader’s understanding of character? What elements in the narrative change—or don’t—over time to signal to the reader that a character is developing?
  
Throughout, students will investigate how emerging writers move from maintaining characters’ status quo and progress to allowing characters to do the unexpected. With every question, we will advance our comprehension of building dynamic representations of people in the world, how they act out, and what it takes to fit in.

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,1:30pm,4:40pm,10519,,S4810-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:30pm,4:40pm,10553,,W3215-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20252-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
