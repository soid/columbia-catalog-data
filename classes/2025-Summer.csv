ACCT B7007,Financial Planning & Analysis,"This course explores the use of financial information for internal planning, analysis, and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.
 Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
 The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal-reporting mistakes.
 To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.
 
 We will examine the following key topics:
 ? Designing managerial information systems to support an organization’s strategy.
 ? Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.
 ? Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.
 ? The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.
 ? The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.
 ? Activity-based costing and activity-based management.
 ? Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.
 ? Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.
 ? The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.
 ? The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",Tim Baldenius,3:45pm,6:45pm,10981,,B7007-20252-001,Financial Planning & Anal,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7007-20252-001/,390 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,,1.5,,SS,20252ACCT7007B001,LECTURE
ACCT B7009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?
The course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models – models that use
financial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements – but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models – but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that
you have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.
By the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private
equity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",Benjamin Segal,12:30pm,3:30pm,11001,,B7009-20252-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B7009-20252-001/,490 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,Business,3,,F,20252ACCT7009B001,LECTURE

ACCT B8009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"This course will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing financial statements. Students will learn about the general tools, theoretical concepts, and practical valuation issues of financial analysis. By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.
 
 Course content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm’s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:
 1. Understand the firm’s strategy. We will assess the firm’s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.
 2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.
 3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.
 4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.
 5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm’s current value.
 
 In the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",Kalash Jain,9:00am,5:00pm,10965,,B8009-20252-001,Financial Statement Analy,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8009-20252-001/,490 Kravis Hall,In-Person,,3,,MTWRU,20252ACCT8009B001,LECTURE

Syllabus, Art in Venice
  
This course examines the art, architecture, and culture of Venice from the 14th to the 18th century. The goal of the curriculum is for students to acquire a firm visual literacy in order to read works of Venetian art and to familiarize themselves with the methods of art history. The course is set up as a field study, using the city as classroom and supporting site visits in and outside of Venice. The goal is to provide students with a solid visual knowledge and historical understanding of a set of key monuments, and to encourage them to think through the social, political, cultural, and intellectual forces at play in the creation of these works. Each day's choice of monuments is based on a walkable itinerary, visiting churches, confraternities, cloisters, palaces, and museums. Day trips include excursions to Padua and the Palladian villas in Vicenza and the Veneto.

AHIS S3107,Constructing the Sacred in Ancient Greec,"This course examines the conception and spatialization of religious experience in ancient Greece through brief chronological surveys and thematic case studies. Definitions of “sacred,” “ritual,” and “divine” will frame lectures and class discussions on cult locations and religious architecture in mainland Greece and western Asia Minor from the Archaic (8th century BCE) to the Early Roman Imperial (2nd century CE) periods.
  
The architectural articulation of sanctuaries will be observed in relation to socio-political, historical, and artistic conditions in which these spaces were formed and existed. Case studies will involve both conventional (e.g., athletic) and idiosyncratic (e.g., healing, mystery performances) cult practices.
  
The second half of the summer session will focus on the materiality of the sacred through smallscale dedications and will make use of the vast collections of the Metropolitan Museum. Finally, we will observe NYC’s urban fabric in walking tours where we consider Greek Revival architecture and phenomena such as continuity, transformation, de-sacralization, and secularization.",Muge Arseven,1:00pm,4:10pm,11275,,W3107-20252-001,Constructing the Sacred,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3107-20252-001/,934 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,MW,20252AHIS3107W001,SEMINAR

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts.

Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the ""long"" nineteenth century, and how events of the period continue to impact our country today. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.  With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",Page S Knox,9:00am,12:10pm,10609,,S3442-20252-001,"American Art, 1750   1914",Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/S3442-20252-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,4,,TR,20252AHIS3442S001,SEMINAR
AHIS S3448,"Theories, Methods, and Experiments in Ar","The use of artificial intelligence—propelled by deep learning techniques—to analyze, curate, and generate digital images is having a profound influence on visual culture, one that well exceeds Jacques Derrida's anticipations of the effects of technology on society as he described them in Archive Fever. While regulation around emerging technologies such as AI is being formulated across the globe with much urgency, a problematic concept of “tech ethics” is being espoused by the leading technology companies that imposes a simplistic moralistic framework on potential policies. Through examination of the creative applications of AI, the aim of this seminar is to foster a nuanced critical discourse on AI art that places the ethics of emerging technologies at center stage. This course provides students with an introduction to the history of AI art and explores the challenges and opportunities that this burgeoning field faces, especially in regard to the regulation of technology. Class visits to Mercer Labs, Artechouse, MoMA, and the Whitney will allow students to directly engage with the core concepts of the seminar.
  
The course begins with reflection on Adorno’s prescient statement that technical rationality is “the rationality of domination,” and challenges both the cynicism and optimism around emerging technologies and their effect on visual culture. We will question the accountability that art history and other fields of study have, if any, to steer the ethics debates spurred by today’s “culture industry” of digital images, and ask what the custodianship of this space entails by examining its structures of power, conveyed visually or through automated processes enabled by computer vision science. By interrogating the socio-cultural effects of the use of machine learning on images—such as algorithmic biases that lend to discrimination, or surveillance and privacy concerns in regard to facial recognition technologies—new and diverse perspectives on visual culture are investigated. Although the mechanisms that enable technology to develop may be lending to the commodification and homogenization of visual culture, the seemingly democratic promises that big tech touts keep us captivated yet surprisingly uncritical. If the transformative role of AI on our visual culture is constituting a new type of archaeology of knowledge, how do we critically lend to its discourse through the theories, methods, and experiments surrounding art and AI?",Emily Spratt,1:00pm,4:10pm,11276,,W3448-20252-001,Theories in Art and AI,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3448-20252-001/,806 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20252AHIS3448W001,SEMINAR
AHIS UN2427,Twentieth-Century Architecture,"This course examines some of the key moments of architectural modernity in the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how architecture participated in the making of a new world order. It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts.

ARTP BC0002,Global Modernism,"The aim of this course is to explore the history and discourses of modern art, modernism, and the
 avant-garde via the social and theoretical questions understood to have driven the development
 of artistic modernism around the globe from roughly 1789 to 1968. The course will be organized
 according to four major lenses of inquiry: “Aesthetic Categories within Social Art Histories,”
 “Formalism and Autonomy,” “Perception and Artistic Production,” and “the Role of the Mind,
 or, the Beholder’s Share.” Each of these lenses, or themes, will be driven by a set of readings,
 images, and key terms that together constitute “conversations,” or orientations toward the history
 of modern art. An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into
 focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader
 discourse. However, because there is a fair amount of conceptual overlap among the course’s
 themes, the foremost goal is to enable critical analysis of modern, visual artworks from multiple
 perspectives, or within multiple frameworks. In considering the many, dynamic engagements of
 theory, history, and visual artworks, this course will provide not only a strong knowledge of
 modern art, modernism, and the avant-garde, it will also help students develop a sense of the
 methods used to study the histories and theories of modern art.",Nicole Coffineau,9:30am,12:00pm,00003,,S0002-20252-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ARTP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARTP/S0002-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252ARTP0002S001,SEMINAR

Students will develop a general understanding of how AI works and what distinguishes GAI from AI, as well as how GAI is different from human communication. Students will practice composing prompts using some of the different AIs to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each. This will lead us to consider questions pertaining to the accuracy of the outputs and potential biases. We’ll consider the impact of AI technology on the environment and on human labor. Issues pertaining to intellectual property and personal privacy will also be discussed. Students will understand the importance of adhering to course and school policies relating to GAI use.

BIET K5315,Special Topics in Philosophical Bioethic,"This course is designed to afford students significant opportunity to explore fundamental bioethical issues in a philosophically searching way. For example, it is generally thought that health matters. But then what is health? And how does it matter? What is justice in respect to health-care and the other social determinants of health? Do competing theories of justice (e.g., liberal, libertarian, utilitarian) offer incompatible solutions to the question of healthcare justice? Or can a workable “overlapping consensus” at the public policy level nevertheless be achieved?
  
Should a healthcare professional be permitted, on grounds of conscience, to refuse to provide a healthcare service to which people are lawfully permitted? Indeed, what should count as “conscience”? In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, some have argued for a right to conscientiously insist on providing reproductive services that have been legally prohibited. How are we to sort through and resolve this complicated set of issues?
  
Could a meaningful personal understanding of what it means for someone to have died nevertheless not be suitable as the basis for a legal declaration of death? Why not? Should there be a “conscience clause” option whereby someone can specify in advance the conception of death to be applied in that individual’s own case? Would every possible criterion be available or would certain criteria have to be excluded? Which? Why?
  
The population in this and many other societies is aging and putting increasingly significant demands on the healthcare delivery system. Should healthcare be rationed according to age?  Would it be unfair to young people not to give weight to that factor—lest they lose out on a fair chance to live as long as society’s seniors already have? What is healthcare justice across the generations?
  
As researchers gain a fuller understanding of the aging process, it may soon be possible to genetically engineer a significant extension (even doubling?) of human life-span. Is this an appropriate objective for healthcare science to be pursuing?  Is the point of healthcare to extend human life as far as possible by whatever means? Is aging a kind of “disease” in its own right? Would life so dramatically extended be beneficial or burdensome?
  
The topics for this course have been selected in view of (i) how fundamental they are to bioethical thinking (e.g., What is health?",Arthur Kuflik,6:00pm,8:00pm,10937,,K5315-20252-D01,Advanced Philosophical BI,Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5315-20252-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20252BIET5315KD01,LECTURE
BIET K5435,"ST Leadership, Ethics & Drug Development","Special Topics in Leadership, Ethics and Drug Development
  
In Ethical leadership decisions regarding drug development, regulation and delivery is a multi-dimensional process with varied stakeholders, each having their own objectives.  This course will provide students with a look at how leaders in health care faced with real-life decisions utilized ethics to determine an outcome. The course is designed as a one week intensive in-person course, with two guest lecturers per day from industry, government, funding organizations, HCPs and patient organizations to help students gain a greater understanding of all stakeholders involved in health care decision making. 
  
Through posted and classroom discussion, speakers will address and students will be challenged to consider the following questions:
  
  
Who are the relevant stakeholders?  What are their preferences and do they conflict?  If so, how is this conflict best resolved?
  
How do we apply a bioethical framework – the principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice -- to this problem?
  
When understanding how a new medicine is developed, how are the long and short term risks, large and small, weighed and evaluated against potential benefits?
  
Does industry consider justice– such as access and affordability – when deciding what products to develop?
  
What would you advise if you were an ethics consultant?
  
What do you think about the actions taken to address the issue?
  
How are ethical questions handled within organizations?  Are consultants used formally or informally to ensure outside perspectives?

Should a national policy on X be implemented? Does Vitamin C truly prevent colds? However, do we really know what these terms and phrases mean?

BUEC B8216,ECONOMICS OF STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR,"This course examines the underlying economics of successful business strategy: the strategic imperatives of competitive markets, the sources and dynamics of competitive advantage, managing competitive interactions, and the organizational implementation of business strategy.
The course combines case discussion and analysis (approximately two thirds) with lectures (one third).  The emphasis is on the ability to apply a small number of principles effectively and creatively, not the mastery of detailed aspects of the theory.  The course offers excellent background for all consultants, managers and corporate finance generalists.",Wouter Dessein,9:00am,5:00pm,10980,,B8216-20252-001,ECONOMICS OF STRATEGIC BE,Business Economics,BUEC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8216-20252-001/,490 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,"Business

This course introduces MBA students to modern experimental techniques, with a focus on randomized control trials (RCTs, also often called A/B tests), which are widely used to gain actionable insights in real business contexts. Students will learn how to design, execute, and analyze experiments that reveal the true impact of business strategies and allow for data-driven decisions.

BUEC B8776,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies a","Given the impact of technological tools and advancements in todays modern economy, it has become increasingly imperative for business professionals and professional graduate students to have a top-down understanding of some of the most relevant, applicable, and highly technical topics such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and digital tokens (among others). This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters. Please note absence from the first day of class will result in automatic forfeiture of students' registration. Auditing is not permitted (no exceptions).",Amir R Farrokhnia,10:00am,6:00pm,10964,,B8776-20252-001,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrenc",Business Economics,BUEC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8776-20252-001/,420 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,"Architecture

We will discuss how the Chinese economy gets to where it is - by managing three transitions simultaneously: from Marx to market, from an inward-looking Middle Kingdom to an externally-oriented world factory, and from farming to industrialization. We will also discuss factors that could influence the chance of success/failure of doing business in China, including local financial sector, exchange rate policy, corruption, and negotiation style.",Shang-Jin Wei,9:00am,5:00pm,11012,,B7756-20252-100,,Business,BUSI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUSI/B7756-20252-100/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TWRFSU,20252BUSI7756B100,SEMINAR

BUSI B8705,Business and Climate Change,"Climate science informs us that global emissions of greenhouse gas emissions must be rapidly and dramatically reduced if humanity is to avoid catastrophic climate change. After three centuries of rising emissions, the entire global economy must now decarbonize in the coming three decades. Fortunately, most of the technologies and investment capital necessary to reduce and eventually eliminate emissions exist or are in development, but the urgency to implement those solutions is critical.
This course provides an overview of climate change, its effects on business, and how businesses can (and should) respond. The course covers emissions sources and their impact on climate change, followed by an exploration of the policy landscape, including current legislation, carbon markets, and climate justice. The course then evaluates current and evolving mitigation technologies, reviews the tools of climate finance, and considers strategies for reducing emissions to net zero. Finally, the course introduces the role of businesses in addressing climate change, including net-zero goals, actions they can take to mitigate their impact, and the perspectives of shareholders. 
Throughout the course, the business case for climate action is emphasized, highlighting the economic benefits of taking action to address climate change.",Gernot Wagner,9:00am,12:15pm,10947,,B8705-20252-001,Business and Climate Chan,Business,BUSI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUSI/B8705-20252-001/,390 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,,1.5,,RF,20252BUSI8705B001,LECTURE

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

CLCV UN1006,Aristotle & AI,"What do the robots in ancient Greek mythology have to tell us about today’s AI? How did slavery shape how Greeks and Romans imagined autonomous tools? Where does artificial intelligence come from, and why do we tell the stories we do about what it can do and how it will change the world?
 This course offers an introduction to the intellectual history of classical antiquity and a critical examination of artificial intelligence in the current cultural and political moment. Students in the course will learn about a topic in ancient Greek and Roman thought — stories about autonomous tools — and how that topic relates to social history and culture in the ancient world. They will then use that knowledge to frame questions about artificial intelligence and robots in present society, and examine critical approaches to the large generative models that are garnering so much attention today. The goal is equip students with a) a basic familiarity with how ancient Greek and Roman thought relates to its cultural context, b) an analytical framework for approaching claims about technology in historical and present contexts, and c) an appreciation for how humanistic inquiry can answer urgent questions in their lives.
 Prerequisites: none
 The course is intended for students for little or no familiarity with the study of the ancient world, and as an introduction to the study of ancient Greece and Rome.

Prerequisite: None. Mediterranean Humanities I is not a requirement to enroll in this course. Instructor: Konstantina Zanou
  
What is the Mediterranean and how was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization? A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and political difference, the Mediterranean has been seen as the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing border and a unifying confluence zone, as a sea of pleasure and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. By exploring major works of theory, literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, South/North and East/West divides, tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism, borders and divided societies) and to ‘read’ the sea through different viewpoints. In the final analysis, Med Hum II is meant to arouse the question of what it means to stand on watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly shifting lens. The Summer version of the course is adapted to contain more material on Venice and its Mediterranean surroundings.

CLMT G5018,Building Equitable Community Partnership,"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional
 effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a “whole of community” approach to disaster management.
 
 The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:
  
  
Describe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience
  
Describe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle
  
Identify whole community approaches for disaster management
  
Identify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management
  
Demonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",Jeffrey Schlegelmilch,3:00pm,4:45pm,10930,,G5018-20252-001,Building Partnerships in,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5018-20252-001/,401 Chandler,Hybrid,,1.5,,TR,20252CLMT5018G001,SEMINAR

CLMT G5032,Disaster Research Methods,"The field of disaster research is relatively new in the United States, as a specific field of study, with the first disaster research center being founded in the early 1960s. The field itself is now highly multi-disciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, anthropology, political science, computer science, engineering, earth sciences, psychology, and medicine and public health. These academic fields have intersected with the practice community by informing holistic emergency planning for all members of a community. Furthermore, these research outputs have informed federal and state policy, the private sector, and community organizations to inform program design and implementation. Translating research into practice remains a constant challenge in this rapidly evolving field. The methodological approaches to disaster research are just as diverse and have become increasingly complex with the advent of big data, the ubiquity of spatial information, and novel cross-disciplinary research. As a new era of compound and cascading disasters has triggered a constant “response” mode within the field of emergency management, the need for practitioners and research with a fluency in research and evaluation methods is required to critically evaluate or generate high quality and ethically based research.",Jonathan J Sury,3:00pm,4:45pm,10932,,G5032-20252-001,,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5032-20252-001/,401 Chandler,Hybrid,,1.5,,TR,20252CLMT5032G001,LECTURE
CLMT G5041,"Climate Ethics, Leadership and Managemen","Often, our progress toward the remediation of persistently accumulating human damage to our collective home, the biosphere, is attributed to large-scale entities having a rather amorphous quality. Such are the industrial revolution, the global north, capitalism, colonialism, and countless preoccupied, habituated or denialist components of the human population. Yet, the dynamics of all types of leadership and management, whether in public, civic or private organizations, frequently push back on the progress desired, in more specific ways. These dynamics are so characteristic that climate ethics, an offshoot of environmental ethics, may seem to be cornered or futile. However, looking more closely at the essential functions of leadership and management, we may find the possibilities of change for the better: change that reverses climate change, or more widely, unsustainability. Conversely, we may find inadequate possibilities for such critical change.
  
In this course, leadership and management are explored to determine their dynamics are and how these afflict our biospheric home—including virtually all life.  The course is divided into 4 sections, the 1st is two weeks long, the 2nd and 3rd are each four weeks long, and the 4th is two weeks long.  The topic of the 1st section is climate ethics, their content and context:  how they work and how they are tripped by surrounding problematic discourses. The topic of the 2nd section is leadership: at its becomingly best, and how it demeans itself with incapability, irresponsibility and corruptibility. The topic of the 3rd section is management: at its operationally best, and how it degrades itself with dysfunctional hierarchy, captive systematization, and offensive behavior.  The topic of the 4th section reverts to climate ethics: the necessity of accruing and maintaining value—of the right kind, and the necessity of creating and applying guidance—of the right kind.  It is not only because the impacts of problematic ways of doing things are harmful to the biosphere but also because those impacts have others, which are increasingly desperate, rancorous and volatile.",Adela J Gondek,3:00pm,4:45pm,10933,,G5041-20252-001,"Climate Ethics, Leader &",Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5041-20252-001/,412 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252CLMT5041G001,SEMINAR

Despite evidence that climate change poses a threat to business as usual for many companies, the financial sector has yet to form a consistent view on how to value risks and opportunities associated with climate change. There are multiple reasons for this. Climate-related disclosures vary widely from company to company, as do the ways that climate risks affect different sectors and geographies. The policy landscape is varied and fast changing. Unfortunately, many financial analysts lack the technical knowledge to assess corporate disclosures and actions pertaining to climate.
  
This 6-week course provides a practical overview of how analysts in the financial sector can assess corporate climate risk and opportunity among publicly traded corporates, using public data. The class will begin with the concept of how business leaders and financial analysts understand climate risk – alongside other concepts such as decarbonization, transition planning and climate impacts from a policy perspective. 
  
We will then move to focus on industry-specific analysis in four sectors – 1) oil and gas, 2) consumer staples, 3) mining, and 4) financial services. In each, we will survey the tools that investors have to assess climate risk and opportunity, taking into account policy, voluntary frameworks, and technology. For each of these elements, we will review both how these tools can assist with climate risk analysis as well as their limitations and inconsistencies. We will consider ways the analyst can work with relevant data and reconcile public corporate claims with evidence through corporate disclosures.",Andrew Howell,11:00am,2:30pm,11088,,G5042-20252-001,Fin.

CLMT G5044,Spatial Analysis of Food Security,"Globally, over 2 billion people are suffering from moderate-to-severe food insecurity and the Sudan famine being the first famine declared in 2025 since 2020. One key aspect to understanding food insecurity is its spatial distribution and trends that contribute to how food secure a population is. This course will teach students how to collect and analyze spatial data related to food security, as well as touch on important topics in food insecurity. The course will focus on taking real-life food security questions and applying spatial analysis techniques to these questions. In the course, we will cover an introduction to spatial analysis, natural experiments in geography, applying remote sensing to food insecurity, climate shocks and food security, and seasonal forecasting and food security.  
  
This class will have a lecture aspect, which will mainly focus on topics in food security and how they relate to data collection, and a lab section, which will be an opportunity for students to collect data directly, clean the data, and analyze the data using the R programming language with spatial research methods. Example topics in class will be climate variability and food insecurity, policies that can successfully address food insecurity, and understanding spatial aggregation in food security statistics and how that can influence interpretation. These topics will then be further explored in the lab section of the class: specifically focusing on downloading weather data for time series analysis, using a convergence of datasets to map hotspots, and investigating how survey data intersects with spatial datasets.",Sarah L Blakeley,1:00pm,2:45pm,11171,,G5044-20252-001,Spatial Analysis Food Sec,Climate School,CLMT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5044-20252-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,1.5,,MW,20252CLMT5044G001,SEMINAR

CLRS UN3314,"The Story, She Told: Women's Autofiction","In her 1975 essay 
The Laughter of Medusa
, Hélène Cixous compared women’s writing—in French, “écriture féminine”—to the unexplored African continent. To date, literary criticism has been grappling with the distinct qualities of literary works, crafted by women. This course offers a survey of main autofictional works and memoirs, written originally in the Russian language within the last 100 years. We will start our journey with the tumults of the WW1 and the Bolshevik Revolution, the Civil War, through the WW2, the Soviet dissident movement, the emigration waves into Israel and the United States, the advent of a post-socialist Russia in 1991—in order to arrive at the two plus decades of Vladimir Putin’s presidency. We will consider  the ways in which each author transposes and conveys her own—and others’ memories—through the medium of autofiction, defined by Serge Doubrovsky, who coined the term in French, as “the adventure of the language, outside of wisdom and the syntax of the novel.” All selected works, with very few exceptions, are available in English;  no reading knowledge of Russian is required.

CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.
 
 All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages
 is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to
 consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request. This course will be of interest to those

CPLS OC3456,1968 Paris,"Instructor 
Bruno Bosteels
, Dean of Humanities and Jesse and George Siegel Professor in the Humanities in the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures and the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society. 
Taught in English.
  
""1968"" remains a watershed year in the history of worldwide struggles for liberation and emancipation. For many the last gasp of the revolutionary era, for others the beginning of a new regime of flexible control. The hypothesis for this seminar holds that ""1968"" matters for a thinking of the event in two essential ways: not only may we ask what happened but we also should ask how we can talk of the happening of an event in the first place. Alternating theoretical and fictional, historical and artistic, filmic and political materials, students will be expected to develop an original take on one aspect of the paradigm shift that affects the thinking of the events of “1968” during that exceptional month of May in Paris, while keeping a close eye on the national and international contexts behind the global sixties.
  
This summer edition of the course will meet three times per week for two hours each, plus a weekly showing and discussion of a movie related to May 1968 in France and around the globe. In addition, the class will include day trips with a guided tour to the Quartier Latin in relation to May ’68 as well as the National Archives. To be confirmed are visits by contemporary theorists and philosophers such as Jacques Rancière or Alain Badiou, for whom May 1968 always was and remains a major touchstone event for their view of emancipatory politics.

DMVP BC1001,Functional Anatomy for Movement,"This is an introduction to the study of Countertechnique® taught by certified Teacher, Francesca Dominguez. Countertechnique® is a system of movement designed for dancers to practice self-direction and to cultivate availability to movement while learning to take risks. Developed over the past 25 years by Dutch choreographer, Anouk Van Dijk, the technique utilizes a task-based approach for body and mind as the vehicle to approach dance. It is a movement system that helps the dancer think with the dancing body by focusing on the process of incorporating anatomical information into action; and beginning to direct and counter-direct the body through space as an alternative to gripping or falling over. Dancers are encouraged to be proactive in discovering connections and solutions, to be less concerned with judging themselves, and to work in a healthy way physically, mentally, and emotionally. The priority is to experience clarity and enjoyment of movement while utilizing the Countertechnique® principles. ☺ www.countertechnique.com By the end of the semester, students will have a clarified relationship to space; a developed coordination and articulation of the body; they will gain knowledge about the anatomy of the body especially joint structure, location, and range; and will be able to begin Scanning – the ability to observe one’s own state-of-being and draw upon solutions according to need and/or experimentation.",Francesca Dominguez,9:30am,12:00pm,00006,,X1001-20252-001,Functional Anatomy Moveme,Pre-College Program (Barnard),DMVP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DMVP/X1001-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252DMVP1001X001,LECTURE

DROM B8106,Operations Strategy,"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,"" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, ""Firm Boundaries,"" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, ""Internal Operations,"" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, ""New Challenges,"" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.""",Medini Singh,9:00am,5:00pm,10978,,B8106-20252-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8106-20252-001/,440 Kravis Hall,In-Person,"Business

Supply chain management encompasses a wide range of activities — from strategic activities, such as capacity expansion or consolidation, make/buy decisions and initiation of supplier contracts, to tactical activities, such as production, procurement and logistics planning, to, finally, operational activities, such as operations scheduling and release decisions, batch sizing and issuing of purchase orders.",Will Ma,9:00am,5:00pm,10970,,B8109-20252-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8109-20252-001/,490 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,"Architecture

DROM B8131,Sports Analytics,"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed.
 
 Students are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the ""laboratory"" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",Mark N Broadie,9:00am,5:00pm,10966,,B8131-20252-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8131-20252-001/,520 GEFFEN HALL,In-Person,"Architecture

The course aims to provide a scientific, social, and economic examination of the city and past, present, and future threats to a sustainable Venice. It will be an immersive experience combining lectures; discussions; field trips; and training in field methods, experimental design, and quantitative analysis, culminating in an individual research project.
  
The course begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of ecology and biodiversity. Topics include marine and terrestrial biodiversity, aquaculture, population ecology and community ecology. It will also provide skill building on experimental design and quantitative analysis.
  
The course will then focus on considering the past, present, and future threats to a sustainable Venice, along with complex and unique local solutions using the three main pillars of sustainability (social, environmental, and economic areas).
  
This course is a partnership between Columbia and the University of Warwick so students can expect to be enrolled alongside Warwick students.

These include a briefing of subject matter experts, a site investigation plan for a town council, a PPT presentation to the executive board of a non-profit organization, a review of a superfund site for a state public health agency, and a factsheet for the general public.",Gabriele Windgasse,,,11176,,P9303-20252-D01,APPL ENVIRONMENTAL PUB HL,Environmental Health Sciences,EHSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EHSC/P9303-20252-D01/,,Hybrid > 80%,,3,,,20252EHSC9303PD01,LECTURE
EHSC P9361,Master's Essay Research I,"The Master's Thesis is one of the options for a capstone requirement of all students in all tracks of the MPH program of the Department of Environmental Health Sciences (EHS). The thesis is intended to reflect the training you have received in the MPH program and demonstrate your ability to design, analyze, research and present scholarly writing relevant to your major field of interest. 
Writing the thesis is an essential experience that could further your career development and or an application for further studies in academia. Employers seek in potential employees with a MPH degree the ability to write articles and reports, and want to see evidence that you can design studies, analyze data, and write scientific papers. If you plan to continue your academic studies, developing expertise and demonstrating your ability as a writer are two important skills required of doctoral candidates. A well-written paper is a great asset that you can bring with you to a job interview or include in an application for further study. The thesis ought to demonstrate your ability to think clearly and convey your thoughts effectively and thereby provide an example of your understanding and insight into a substantive area in which you have developed expertise.",Nina Kulacki,,,12964,,P9361-20252-D01,MASTERS ESSAY RESEARCH I,Environmental Health Sciences,EHSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EHSC/P9361-20252-D01/,,In-Person,,0-6,,,20252EHSC9361PD01,INDEPENDENT

A significant portion of the class material will be devoted to abstract theoretical foundations of strategic political interaction, which will prove instrumental in understanding and predicting patterns of political behavior and outcomes. Although there will be a sizable amount of literature you will be asked to rummage through, our approach will not be entirely interpretive. In fact, a significant amount of class time will be allocated to the practical application of knowledge gathered from readings and discussions.

The readings, lectures, and class discussions address ongoing debates over the prospects for global governance. Special attention is given to the role of international institutions, including the United Nations, regional organizations, and international financial institutions. We discuss global policies on investment and trade, combating poverty, and sustainable development. Pressing security issues are also discussed, including peacebuilding in war-torn societies, terrorism, cybersecurity, and weapons of mass destruction.
  
The format of the class combines open-ended lectures and interactive discussions of assigned readings. Each week, students discuss and debate three assigned articles that offer differing interpretations of the global dilemma addressed in the session. Assigned readings are carefully selected to convey of a range of opinions on controversial themes. Restricting the syllabus to several readings per week cannot do justice to the complexity of each topic.  However, a realistic reading assignment enables students to fulfill this requirement diligently, and you are expected to do so.

ENGL BC1068,True Crime,"Over the centuries, readers have been drawn to accounts of “true” crime—violent narratives involving real people and real events. And yet, as with any literary object, the notion of “truth” is always unstable—stories and their tellings are always shaped by the motivations, values, and choices of those who tell them, often with an eye toward the audience that will consume them. Whether constructed in order to moralize, to enforce or critique social or political ideologies, or purely to sell copies, “true
 crime” is a literary genre that reveals attitudes about gender, race, and class; that illustrates—and sometimes calls into question—cultural norms and mores; that calls on readers to reflect on their own morbid curiosity and assumptions and fears. In this class we will engage with a diverse selection of literary texts—spanning from the Middle Ages to the present day and from a range of genres, including pamphlets, plays, novels, and more—as well as contemporary films, a tv series, and a
 podcast. Through close reading and critical analysis, we will examine the evolution of the “true crime” genre and the cultural and societal contexts that shape the portrayal of crime for popular consumption. We will explore the ways in which texts and authors sensationalize, moralize, and convey the complexities of crime. We will analyze point of view: who’s telling the story, whom we sympathize with, and what insights we get into the minds of those committing crimes as well as those who fall prey to them. We will consider justice and policing— the role played by the law and its enforcers in shaping narratives about crime and punishment, right and wrong. Finally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of representing real-life crimes in literature, and how “true crime” narratives shape social perceptions, fears, prejudices, and notions of justice and morality.",Penelope Usher,9:00am,12:10pm,00045,,X1068-20252-001,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1068-20252-001/,111 MILSTEIN CEN,,,3,,TR,20252ENGL1068X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC1903,DEAD MOTHERS AND WICKED STEPMOTHERS: THE,"You know them well: on one side, the scheming, jealous stepmother, obsessed with her fading youth. On the other, her husband’s virginal, naive, and beautiful daughter – whose own mother is usually dead. The conflict between them is so familiar that it feels inevitable.

 gender, sexuality, morality, fear, and authority, among other things. For millennia, female spirituality

On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.

ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10133,,S3273-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3273-20252-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3693,SALLY ROONEY- AUTHORSHIP IN THE 21ST CEN,"In this seminar, we will study “Sally Rooney.” In so doing, we will talk about the real author of that name: a thirty-year old Irishwoman whose three novels, each set in Ireland and concerning the social and erotic lives of attractive young people of European descent, have achieved remarkable commercial and critical success. We will talk about the pleasures of those texts, as well as their formal and generic features, their language and their relation to literary history.  But we will also discuss the idea and institution named “Sally Rooney,” considering it as what Michel Foucault called an “author function,” or what Pierre Bourdieu dubbed a “space of possibilities” within the literary field.
  
Our inquiry into “Sally Rooney” will, therefore, also be an inquiry into the meaning of literary authorship in the twenty-first century. Through secondary readings in criticism and theory, we will engage longstanding arguments about the relation between critical interpretation and authorial intention, as well as between social and historical “context” and authorial and aesthetic autonomy. We will examine how patterns of social exclusion — in this case, race — define the digitally-mediated literary field of the present. And we will ask how the rise of social media and online retail have altered ideas and institutions of authorship, audience, and literariness.",Matthew Hart,1:00pm,4:10pm,10520,,S3693-20252-001,SALLY ROONEY,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3693-20252-001/,522B Kent Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252ENGL3693S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.
  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order):

Readings will include wordless works by Shaun Tan, classic works by Alison Bechdel, as well as many that may be less familiar. Students will analyze the American, Asian, and European approaches to comics. Guest speakers from the comics industry will aid in developing students' analytical skills.

http://coms4170.cs.columbia.edu/2024-spring/
  
**Attendance required**
 This class is highly interactive, and attendance for many of the lectures is mandatory. Especially in the second half of the class, students must attend in-class project mentoring sessions to get feedback from their TA and fellow students.
  
 
**Technical Preparation**
 The first half of the class is quite technical, we introduce principles of usable design and integrate them in to technical assignments. There is a lot of programming in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python (server-side). Whereas we do teach these technologies, we constantly find that students who have seen them before have a better time in class. Former students have advised future students to do an online web programming series like CodeAcademy (which is sadly no longer free). Advanced Programming is an advised pre- requisite, but the true pre-requisite is simply coding experience. You will be expected to figure out some of the programming aspects by yourself, and you need the maturity to do that. Hint: ask GPT.

ENGL UN3638,Contemporary American Short Story Collec,"In 2013, Alice Munro was honored with the Nobel Prize in literature. Munro’s award was seen as a literary landmark: the first time that the prize was awarded to a writer whose exclusive form was the short story. The award was seen as fitting recognition, not only for this writer in particular, but also more broadly as moment of recognition for the short story’s importance as a genre, especially in a publishing industry that has long been dominated by the novel.
  
In this course, we will focus on the contemporary North American short story authors featured on our syllabus: Chimamanda Adichie, George Saunders, Lydia Davis, Carmen Machado, Leanne Simpson, Anthony Veasna So. Some of the writers on this list are veterans of the short story form. Others are authors who recently published debut collections. As we work through our reading list, we will attempt to analyze not only individual short stories, but also what marks these books as collections. What might hold these texts together? What disrupts the unifying principles of a collection? And most importantly, what do short stories offer—in terms of representations of American life and culture and itscomplexity—that other forms do not?",Denise Cruz,9:00am,12:10pm,10683,,S3638-20252-001,Contemp.

ENGL UN3804,British Women Writers: the Woman Questio,"This course will examine British women writers including Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf in the context of the (long-) nineteenth-century ""Woman Question"". Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman’s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of “woman’s nature” in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman’s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between “inward impulse and outward fact”? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: “What does a woman want?”",Aileen G Forbes,1:00pm,4:10pm,10148,,W3804-20252-001,British Women Writers,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3804-20252-001/,325 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252ENGL3804W001,SEMINAR

ENGP BC1000,Introduction to Writing about Literature,"What does it mean to close read? Does the author’s biography matter to understanding a text? What about the time and place that the text was written? This course will introduce students to a range of habits, practices, and approaches to writing about literature and culture that widen and deepen how one can respond to and interpret a novel, a poem, and various other cultural artifacts. At the same time, we will engage in writing practices that empower students to locate and articulate what interests them about a particular piece of writing or culture, to make a claim about it, and to articulate that claim against other interpretations. Foundational to this endeavor is re-envisioning the writing process, from an isolated, individual process to one that involves collaboration and conversation; copious in-class writing; peer workshops; the power of drafts and revision; and the inclusion of research and theoretical frames. We will use Jamaica Kincaid’s novella Lucy as our main text, accompanied by shorter readings and visits to the museum, Barnard library and archive and other excursions that expand the world of our writing and the objects we wish to understand.",Tara Needham,9:30am,12:00pm,00008,,X1000-20252-001,Intro Writing Lit & Cultu,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/X1000-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252ENGP1000X001,LECTURE
ENGP BC1204,CHANGES SPACES AND MOBILITIES: WOMEN IN,"The turn-of-the-century United States was a nation on the cusp of a number of momentous social, cultural, and political movements. One of the biggest changes was in the status and role of women. From the emergence of the New Woman in the last decade of the 19th century, to the suffragette in the 1910s and the flapper in the 1920s, the roles and positions of women were expanding and evolving in unprecedented ways. Coupled with the growth and expansion of cities, women’s mobility and the spaces they occupied changed dramatically during this time period. In this course, we will examine texts that depict the situation of women and their mobility in various social and cultural contexts in the shifting urban landscape of early twentieth-century New York City. What spaces were women allowed/expected to occupy? What spaces were considered taboo or off limits? What were the effects and consequences of the spaces that women occupied? How did women’s mobility differ to men’s? How do race and class impact mobility and space? What factors influenced women’s mobility and how did these factors change/develop over time? Course materials will likely include work by Nella Larsen, Djuna Barnes, Sui Sin Far, Anzia Yezierska, Edith Wharton, and Faith Baldwin, as well as the film Skyscraper Souls",Kristina Chesaniuk,9:30am,12:00pm,00009,,X1204-20252-001,CHANGES SPACES AND MOBILI,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/X1204-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,R,20252ENGP1204X001,LECTURE

We’ll think about how comedy comes simply from finding the fun in the story we want to tell. We take our fun seriously, thinking about how comedy can be used to challenge constructs of identity and power. How can humor be illuminating?  How can humor be feminist? How can humor be intersectional? How can humor help us tell the hard truths?  Can we laugh at oppression without laughing it off? The fun of the story is sometimes a good joke, sometimes it’s simply that we’ve lived to tell. Coursework will include in-class writing exercises and short pieces through which students will develop a research question that they will work into a final research presentation.",Nina Sharma,1:30pm,4:00pm,00106,,S1003-20252-001,Humor Writing,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGP,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGP/S1003-20252-001/,To be announced,,,0,,MTR,20252ENGP1003S001,SEMINAR

ENVP IA9229,Workshop in Applied Earth Systems Manage,"This intensive summer workshop is the first in a three-part sequence designed to provide MPA-ESP students with practical experience in interdisciplinary environmental problem-solving. Students work in faculty-advised teams to develop a management strategy for implementing an environmental statute or international agreement not yet in effect. Emphasis is placed on translating scientific understanding into actionable policy and operational plans. The summer term focuses on the scientific basis of the policy challenge, enabling students to communicate complex environmental science to non-scientific stakeholders and decision-makers.

We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these different metrics and the tradeoffs between them. We also cover how regulatory frameworks impact both the details and the strategy of building these engines. Lastly, we cover counterparty-credit methodologies, mainly as they apply to Trading Book risk.",Marcus Eich,6:10pm,8:00pm,10836,,K5410-20252-D02,,Enterprise Risk Management,ERMC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ERMC/K5410-20252-D02/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20252ERMC5410KD02,LECTURE

ERMC PS5430,LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT,"Indicators of companies running into hard times typically include revenue volatility, loss of key personnel, reputational damage, and increased litigation. However, company failures are frequently marked by insufficient liquidity, or the lack of cash to meet obligations. Liquidity risk is the unexpected change in a company’s cash resources or demands on such resources that results in the untimely sale of assets, and/or an inability to meet contractual demands and/or default. In extreme cases, the lack of sufficient cash creates severe losses and results in company bankruptcy.
  
An institution’s cash resources and obligations can and must be managed. Indeed, the field of liquidity risk management is an established part of treasury departments at sizable institutions. The regularity of cash flows and the turbulence of business and markets must be assessed and quantified. This course provides students the tools and techniques to manage all types of liquidity challenges including the need to sell assets unexpectedly in the market, or work through ‘‘run‐on-the‐bank’’ situations for financial services companies.",Joseph Dziwura,8:10pm,10:00pm,10839,,K5430-20252-001,,Enterprise Risk Management,ERMC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ERMC/K5430-20252-001/,307 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,3,,T,20252ERMC5430K001,LECTURE

The course follows three main themes: 1. How the filmmaking process (camera movements, lighting, dialogue, acting, etc.) is used as a method to describe space (filmmaking as a geographic method). 2. How various genres of film have been used to portray the social geography of New York City (the geography of film). 3. The relationship between the viewer’s “place” and the places portrayed in the film (communication geography).

The course follows three main themes: 1. How the filmmaking process (camera movements, lighting, dialogue, acting, etc.) is used as a method to describe space (filmmaking as a geographic method). 2. How various genres of film have been used to portray the social geography of New York City (the geography of film). 3. The relationship between the viewer’s “place” and the places portrayed in the film (communication geography). Finally, we will also consider how our personal sense of place towards New York City has altered throughout the course.",Ross T Hamilton,5:30pm,8:40pm,00052,,X1020-20252-002,,BARNARD SUMMER PROGRAMS,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/X1020-20252-002/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20252FILM1020X002,SEMINAR

But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms. The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums.

FILM UN3024,Horror Movies and New York,"In 1933’s 
King Kong
, the titular giant ape is brought to New York City in chains—he is brought to Broadway, becoming an object of spectacle for the gaping crowds. Film scholar James Snead describes the film as an “allegory of the slave trade… and of various other forms of exploitation and despoilment.” Snead finds in the monster movie gestures towards the fears of an emancipated Black America as represented by the Harlem Renaissance and even, with its climax at the very top of the Empire State Building, a critique of American Capitalism. How the scholar uncovers, in 
King Kong, 
anxieties about the city and the wider American experience, emblematizes the ‘against-the-grain’ approach of this class which asks: what kind of subterranean views of New York City and its taboo/unseen histories emerge when we look deep into the shadows of the horror genre?
  
Our eye will move across the city as well as across film and media history, plunging from the heights of King Kong’s looming skyscraper to Greenwich Village where murderers lurk among our neighbors (
Rear Window
). We will move from the macabre world of a cruel, sometimes demonic upper class (
American Psycho
, 
Rosemary’s Baby
) to the gay cruising scene of the 1970s menaced by slashers who may be hiding in the dancing crowd (
Cruising
).
  
With its emphasis on field trips, the course will offer a holistic view of an iconic yet always changing city with visits to the top of the Empire State Building and to the Museum of Reclaimed Space. There, we will gain lessons on gentrification’s costs as well as strategies to resist its insidiously flattening force. For our week on Roman Polanski’s 
Rosemary’s Baby
, we will visit the setting of the Dakota Hotel, mulling how the film about a woman who may be giving birth to an otherworldly creature visualizes urban space as a place of profound disconnection. It will mobilize the archival resources of Columbia’s collections around the featured films, so students can appreciate how New York-based critics perceived these films’ representations of the city. To further frame how horror can be a space to explore unsung histories and the impacts of ongoing cultural traumas, acclaimed artists will be invited into the classroom. These include: Pornsak Pichetshote whose graphic novel 
Infidel
 presents the prejudices, paranoias, and fears of post-9/11 New York in a monstruous light a",Fareed Ben-Youssef,1:00pm,4:10pm,10597,,S3024-20252-001,Horror Movies and New Yor,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3024-20252-001/,507 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252FILM3024S001,SEMINAR
FILM UN3025,Narrative Design for Games and Interacti,"Traditionally, stories have followed a linear path, with a clear distinction between teller and audience. Yet, since the late 20th century, this model is shifting. Today, postmodern fiction, video games, interactive films, VR, participatory theater and immersive experiences offer audiences agency, creating a challenge for creators: how do they uphold narrative integrity while allowing for choice, collaboration, and remixing?
  
In this class, we’ll examine how modern narrative designers craft stories across media that invite audience participation. Through history, analysis, and workshops, we’ll explore how creators design for interaction while preserving tone and themes, turning audiences into active participants.
  
For the final assignment, students will develop a 12-15 minute pitch presentation for an original story concept, adapting it into an interactive format that balances strong authorial vision with audience agency.",Nick Braccia,1:00pm,4:10pm,10598,,S3025-20252-001,Narr Design for Games & I,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3025-20252-001/,508 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252FILM3025S001,SEMINAR
FILM UN3045,Film Criticism & Story Development,"Criticism is an important skill to have, to appreciate and understand film more. But criticism isn’t black and white, and most importantly, it can help inform us of how to shape, tell, and develop a story that resonates with the audience.
  
This course will begin by exploring the basics of film criticism and film appreciation, as students develop their skills in analyzing and identifying components that make a film work (or fall short). As they approach the second half of the course, students will transform their skills in critiquing into productive feedback and use what they’ve learned to form and develop stories of their own, write a 1-2 page treatment, and finally pitch their story ideas in front of the class.
  
Everyone is interested in telling a story, but through the lens of film criticism, students will appreciate the creative process and learn how it is empowered by what we watch and most importantly, how we watch. Students will use this summer course to identify and prepare for areas of focus that they might be interested in pursuing (screenwriting, directing, producing) in their academic career.",Kevin L Lee,2:00pm,5:10pm,10627,,S3045-20252-001,Film Criticism & Story De,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3045-20252-001/,508 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252FILM3045S001,SEMINAR

French cinema is characterized by its artistic richness, its vigor and, above all, its diversity. This film history course will function as a journey in which we explore contemporary French cinema. Our itinerary will take us from the 1990s, those of “young French cinema” and neoclassicism, to the end of the 2010s, those of directors like Julie Delpy and Christophe Honoré. Together, we will develop a panorama in which the works of Cédric Klapisch and Nicole Garcia will intersect, as well as those of Céline Sciamma and Arnaud Desplechin.
  
The objective of this course will be to introduce students to French cinema, its history and its diversity. We will also have the chance to correlate academic knowledge and practical experience, so as to give the students a significant idea of French film activity. The application process is competitive and will take place onsite in February.

Instructor: Dimitris Antoniou, Associate Research Scholar and Lecturer in Hellenic Studies,

 Initiative.
  
Columbia Summer Global Core: The Athens
 
Experience
 examines the way particular spaces—cultural, urban, literary—serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on nationalism and the theme of the 
polis
 (the city) as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. What understandings of Greek culture, society, and environment emerge from cartography, scientific expeditions, archaeological excavations, and, more recently, economic and artistic commissions? In what ways does the idea of crisis (economic, environmental, public health) shape understandings of Greek everyday life and cultural production today? We will engage in a historically informed study of the “right now” and learn through collaborative work, cross-media exploration, and a project-based approach. The program will be structured around the Global Core course  
Hellenism and the Topographical Imagination
 and will consist of classroom seminars centered on the study and discussion of texts, films, and cultural artifacts; site visits, fieldtrips, and walking tours; and workshop sessions, all of which will prepare students for this year’s final project—curating a permanent exhibition in the new Athens Global Center examining the neoclassical building’s important place in the capital’s cultural and political life.

HIST GU4112,The European Enlightenment,"This course aims to introduce students to classic and more recent literature on the intellectual and cultural history of the Enlightenment. The field has expanded far beyond the cohort of free-thinking 
philosophes
 around which it was initially conceived to encompass broader cultural, economic, and religious preoccupations. Given these tendencies, how has the significance of the Enlightenment shifted as a historical period and interpretive framework? In what ways do scholars explicate its origins, outcomes, and legacies? The readings trace the development of Enlightenment thought and practices from their early manifestations in Britain and the United Provinces before shifting attention to France, the geographical focal point of the movement by mid-century. Topics to be addressed include the relationship of traditional political authorities to an emerging public sphere, the invention of society as a means of mediating human relationships, the entrepreneurial and epistemological innovations made possible by new media, the struggles of the 
philosophe
 movement for legitimacy, debates surrounding luxury consumption and commercial society, the rise of political economy as field of knowledge and practical platform, and arguments between Christian apologists and radical atheists over the status of religious truth.",Charly J Coleman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10552,,W4112-20252-001,The European Enlightenmen,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W4112-20252-001/,311 Fayerweather,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252HIST4112W001,SEMINAR

This course explores France’s complex racialized colonial history by encouraging students to examine the ways the country helped constitute a racialized colonial empire and the ways it created the conditions the conditions to challenge it. The course encourages students to contemplate how France has figured into the creation of the African Diaspora and how diasporic movements for freedom have shaped France. The course will build upon the concept of vernacular landscapes to encourage students to examine how these histories are memorialized, or not, in France today. Topics to be explored will include: the impact of slavery on France, including its port cities including Nantes; the intertwined character of the French and Haitian Revolutions; the convergence of anti-colonial movements in Paris during the interwar period and beyond, and the experiences of Black expatriates in the country during the twentieth century. The course’s location at Reid Hall in Paris will give students ample opportunities to students to examine the reciprocal impact between France and decolonization and freedom movements.

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10191,,S3116-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S3116-20252-001/,311 Fayerweather,In-Person,,4,,MW,20252HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the

HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

IKNS PS5301,Strategic Consulting for Knowledge-based,"The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with the typical phases of an internal or external consulting project. The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,  phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A  typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor/client  relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a  variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or  product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and  the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and  proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.
  
Successful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the  client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on  the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to  work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual  and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing  expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability  to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.  During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,  processes, and social factors that promote successful change.
  
This course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external  organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives. No  prerequisites.",Edward J Hoffman,8:10pm,10:00pm,10786,,K5301-20252-D01,STRATGIC CONSLTNG FOR KNW,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5301-20252-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20252IKNS5301KD01,LECTURE
IKNS PS5988,Human-Centered Design for Data-Driven St,"Within this course, students will explore how practices from human-centered design (HCD) can be applied to the end-to-end data science workflow—problem (use case) definition, data collection & preparation, data exploration, data modeling, and communicating and visualizing the results— in order to build trust in data that is used to drive strategy and decision making and impact organizational change. Students will learn about fundamental human values and how methods from the behavioral sciences and HCD can inspire ethical use of data to drive strategy and change in the modern, data-driven workplace. Students will understand how keeping “humans in the loop” is beneficial, and they will develop a critical eye for assessing whether the data they rely on to make decisions at work is human-centric, particularly as we become more reliant on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to inform our insights, strategies, and decision making at work.
  
 Content & Goals: Through hands-on, project-based work, students will work individually and in project teams to practice designing human-centric information and communication experiences, leveraging audience-focused data visualizations and storytelling techniques to drive a strategic workplace objective, motivating leaders and employees into action to create traceable organizational impact that benefits people. Students will have an opportunity to practice their writing and presentation skills through practical course assignments.
  
 Logistics: This graduate-level elective course is designed for students in Information & Knowledge Strategy but is open to other students at Columbia University. This course would be relevant to students studying management and technology more broadly. The course will be delivered in person on Columbia’s campus during the spring semester.

IKNS PS5999,IKNS INDEPENDENT STUDY,"Overview
: This 1 semester course (elective, IKNS students only, hybrid) provides an opportunity for a student to extend or supplement their educational experience via a deep-dive into an established or novel area of research of their choice (the topic), under the guidance & supervision of a faculty member (the supervisor). An independent study course allows a student to work one-on-one with a faculty member to gain & contribute new insight into the discipline of Knowledge Management.
  
Topic/objective
: The topic is chosen by the student as long as it falls within the general realm of Knowledge Management or its specific content areas in the IKNS curriculum, such as IT systems, knowledge organizing systems, data repositories, business data analytics including machine learning & AI, learning processes, collaboration, dialogue, team & project management, transformational leadership, change management, digital transformation, or digital product innovation. The course will therefore serve the dual purpose of allowing a student to pursue their own intellectual curiosity & to make a contribution to the wider discipline of Knowledge Management. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the content they acquired in other courses, by applying this content to the specific topic chosen for the Independent Study.
  
Logistics
: Ahead of registration, the student meets with the supervisor to discuss & agree on (i) the topic & the relevant IKNS curriculum area(s); (ii) the timeline of deliverables, milestones, & contact hours for the semester; & (iii) the number of credits. The student summarizes these points in a ~1 pg 
Independent Study Proposal
. The student can register for the course only once the supervisor & the Academic Director agree to & sign the 
Independent Study Proposal
 (which includes the topic, the IKNS curriculum area, the number of credits, & the assigned supervisor). The number of credits (1-3) will be commensurate with the scope of the Independent Study. The scope can range from a summary of existing sources (typically 1 credit. 5-10 pg report), to a synthesis or meta-analysis of existing & new sources, e.g., interviews withSMEs (typically 2 credits, 10-15 pg report), to a comprehensive study which adds the student’s own critical discussion & suggestions to the topic (typically 3 credits; 15-20 pg report).",Blake Dicosola,,,10789,,K5999-20252-D01,,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5999-20252-D01/,,On-Line Only,,1-3,,,20252IKNS5999KD01,INDEPENDENT

INTL S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10091,,S6559-20252-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6559-20252-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252INTL6559S001,SEMINAR

Instructor: Ricardo Andres Belisario
  
Syllabus - Intensive Elementary
  
The equivalent of Italian 1101/1102 at Columbia. This intensive first year course, open to students with no previous training in Italian, prepares students to move into intermediate Italian.
  
The course provides students with a foundation in the four language skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing.

Instructor: 
Matthew Fraleigh
  
This course is intended primarily for beginning students who have no prior knowledge of Classical Japanese (bungo 文語 / kobun 古文 / kogo 古語, etc.). It is designed to give students a systematic and intensive introduction to the grammar of classical Japanese. Texts are taken mainly from the Heian and medieval periods, though texts from later periods will also be introduced. It is expected that by the end of the course students will have acquired a firm foundation in classical Japanese grammar and will be able to read classical Japanese texts with the aid of a dictionary. Students will generally find that they also have an improved grasp of modern Japanese grammar and will also gain experience in using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries. The course will also include some instruction in reading cursive Japanese, primarily variant kana (hentaigana).

MATH UN2015,Linear Algebra and Probability,"Linear algebra with a focus on probability and statistics. The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a priori background in the life sciences is assumed.
  
This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.
  
Math majors, joint majors, and math concentrators must take MATH UN2010 Linear Algebra or MATH UN1207 Honors Math A, which focus on linear algebra concepts and foundations that are needed for upper-level math courses.

MATH UN2015,Linear Algebra and Probability,"Linear algebra with a focus on probability and statistics. The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a priori background in the life sciences is assumed.
  
This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:10pm,10260,,W1001-20252-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W1001-20252-001/,141 Uris Hall,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252MDES1001W001,LECTURE

MENA OC4100,"Migration, Displacement and Diaspora in","MENA4100OC: Migration, Displacement and Diaspora in the Contemporary Mediterranean. 3 points. 
  
This course counts as a 
Global Core Requirement
 at Columbia University.  
  
This course examines the social, political and cultural history of migration in the Mediterranean, with a particular focus on France and Africa. We examine the forces that have underpinned migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political, social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between
 politics and the arts.

 is required of MS students until all requirements (including the Thesis) have been completed. Continuous registration means the student must be registered each and every semester or, he or she must be on an official leave of absence. If continuous registration is not maintained, the student must apply for readmission to the Graduate School. ‘Continuous Registration’ includes summer sessions.
  
Students can satisfy the continuous registration requirement and maintain their current status by registering for Matriculation and Facilities (MTCF9751), allowing them access to all University facilities.  It is important for students to request leaves of absence in writing for any term in which they will be away from the University. This may be for reasons of ill health, maternity or paternity leave, military service, or other reasons deemed to be acceptable for leave by the University. If a student does not officially request a leave of absence and does not register for a semester, the student MUST apply for readmission to the University before registration is allowed.  Prior to submitting the leave of absence form, students must meet with their advisor to discuss academic progress, plans, and leave. Students should understand that taking a leave during the period in which the Department has offered support may result in a loss of funding.

MUSI GU4135,Opera in Venice,"MUSI4135OC: Opera in Venice. 3 Points.
  
Prerequisites: None
  
Instructor: Giuseppe Gerbino
  
Opera as we know it was born in Venice. After an early phase of private operatic experiments under the patronage of courts and aristocratic academies, the first public opera house, the San Cassiano Theater, opened its doors in Venice in 1637. As a commercial enterprise, opera rapidly came to dominate the social and cultural life of the city, as Venice grew into one of the most influential and strangely seductive European capitals of music.
  
The course traces the Venetian history of opera from its origins to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Students will also have an opportunity to explore the legacy of this tradition in contemporary Venice as well as in the twentieth-century construction of a nostalgic image of the city’s past musical splendor. Instruction will focus on the relationship between the unique political and topographical organization of Venice and the development of opera. The syllabus integrates academic training with activities designed to allow students to take full advantage of Venice’s historical and cultural resources, including live musical performances, museum visits, and workshops on the workings of Venice’s historical theaters.

NECR PS5107,Organizational Conflict and Mediation,"Organizations have adopted formal approaches, such as establishing grievance committees and ombudsman's offices, to mediate conflicts in the workplace setting and, on occasion, hire outside, independent mediators to handle escalated conflicts and public-facing disputes. Attempts to mediate conflict, though, are much more widespread in organizations than these formal approaches would suggest and are often undertaken by professionals from a wide variety of disciplines who have no formal training in mediation. Increasingly, such professionals are tasked to manage conflicts — whether their field is finance, marketing, social media or human resources — and are evaluated in performance reviews on their ability to perform this task. Professionals today must be prepared to acquire the knowledge and skills of a mediator to meet the expectations of the organization. 
  
With that end in mind, this course is designed for professionals who find themselves frequently having to intervene in conflicts between or among others. Although these professionals may choose to become full-time mediators, they are more likely to use mediation principles and techniques as additional tools to help them within their chosen fields of work, be it in public policy, social media, human resources, international development, peace-building or law. This course will aid professionals who wish to become skilled conflict practitioners, constructively managing conflict between or among people or groups with whom they engage.
  
This course is an elective in the NECR Program. It is open, space permitting, to cross-registrants from other fields and Columbia University schools and programs. There is no prerequisite knowledge or coursework to register for the course; however, if you have not taken a course in negotiation or studied that field, please contact the instructor. The course is delivered in-person on campus; participation by Zoom is not permitted. The course is semi-intensive and delivered over a partial semester.",Michele Riley,9:00am,5:00pm,11018,,K5107-20252-001,Org.

NECR PS5202,APPLIED CONFLICT RESOLUTION: FROM THEORY,"This course explores the intersection of theory and practice in conflict resolution, giving students the opportunity to apply theories, models, and frameworks to real world scenarios. Students will analyze case studies, review current events, and bring to bear their own experiences in international, organizational, community and interpersonal conflicts in an interactive setting as they continue to develop and hone their critical thinking and conflict analysis skills. 
  
Drawing from the disciplines of social and clinical psychology, political and organizational sciences, and international relations, conflict resolution practitioners have at their disposal a wealth of research that can inform their analysis of a situation and how to assist parties to mitigate, de-escalate and prevent conflict.
  
Participants in this class engage with the course readings, instructors, and each other to critically analyze and deconstruct complex conflicts in a variety of contexts. A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Applying conflict resolution constructs and frameworks such as interdependence, intergroup conflict, social identity, bias, peacebuilding, power dynamics, culture, and negotiation frameworks, are among the key learnings integrated into the course.
  
The competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life. Students will be empowered to reflect critically on texts, select relevant data, understand the applicability of a theory, and offer results-based recommendations in contexts ranging from global to personal.",Christine D Straw,6:10pm,8:00pm,11020,,K5202-20252-D01,APPLIED CONFLICT RESOLUTI,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5202-20252-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,R,20252NECR5202KD01,SEMINAR

We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",Camilo Azcarate,9:00am,5:00pm,11023,,K5210-20252-001,CONF RESOLUTION/DYNAMIC S,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5210-20252-001/,328 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,MTW,20252NECR5210K001,LECTURE

NECR PS5250,Open Source Intelligence: Research for C,"The elective ""Open Source Intelligence: Research for Conflict Analysis""
 
course is designed to introduce students to key practical insights, tips, and professional skills necessary for any successful conflict resolution practitioner. In this course, students will be required to practically apply some of the tools and techniques of NECR, and appreciate the importance of combining and reformulating the basic NECR concepts in order to serve their exact needs in the field. 
  
Through this course, students have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the classroom, learn additional practical research skills, and adjust them to their own very specific professional aspirations in the field. This course also helps students strategize their next professional steps in the field in a concise, methodical way. 
  
It is important to keep in mind that the Conflict Resolution field at large is quite diverse, and our students have unique backgrounds and future aspirations. Therefore, this course is customized in coordination with each student during 1-on-1 sessions that take place at the beginning of the semester, in order for each student to be working on something that is clear, and has practical value for his/her very specific professional interests. 
  
As with many things in life, proactiveness, creativity, and an entrepreneurial spirit are keys to success for our very challenging field.  Each student will be having a required 1-on-1 session with the instructor, where the instructor will help the student explore ways to creatively strategize their next professional steps as practitioners and also develop the instructions for the final paper that match the needs of the student. 
  
Overall, the goal is to provide students with an enriching, personal experience that helps them rethink their role as practitioners and strategize better their short/ long term goals in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution.",Nikolas Katsimpras,9:00am,11:15am,11250,,K5250-20252-D01,OSINT: Res for Confl Anal,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5250-20252-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,1.5,,U,20252NECR5250KD01,LECTURE

NECR PS5270,Social Justice and Conflict Resolution i,"NECR 5270 is a three-credit summer practicum course designed to expose students to the role of social justice in conflict resolution analysis and practice, using New York City as our laboratory. Each summer, we will focus on a single, challenging question facing NYC at the intersection of conflict resolution and social justice, including how to respond to gang violence, how to address inequality, how to manage immigration and more. Within the chosen topic, we will explore the historical and theoretical intersections between the fields of social justice and conflict resolution, drawing on our conflict analysis and resolution skills to explore concrete policy options and community strategies. The course builds on the historical connection between conflict resolution and social justice, particularly as it emerged during the civil rights movement, where nonviolent resistance and negotiation were used to challenge systemic oppression. It also draws on the foundational work of Morton Deutsch at Columbia University, whose research on cooperation, competition, and social justice highlights how power imbalances can perpetuate conflict. Through critical dialogue, case study analysis, and practitioner-led workshops, students will develop culturally sensitive, sustainable, and community-centered.
  
We will focusing on needs-based strategies for addressing gang violence in New York City, while critically examining the role of bias in our work as conflict resolution scholars and practitioners. Students will analyze the social, economic, and psychological factors that drive individuals toward gang involvement, and learn about gang structures and the role of gang rivalries in driving crime. In addition to classroom learning, students will participate in fieldwork designed to expose them to experts, policymakers, activists, and practitioners working directly on issues related to gang violence in New York City. These immersive experiences will offer opportunities to engage with real-world challenges while critically reflecting on how biases—both personal and systemic—affect the implementation of violence prevention strategies and conflict resolution efforts. Fieldwork activities may include visits to local violence prevention programs, meetings with law enforcement officials focused on reducing bias in community engagement, and discussions with activists leading restorative justice initiatives.

Introduction to Negotiation, the course provides students with many
 
opportunities to understand the interpersonal dynamics of conflict and to
 
practice the skills of negotiation, mediation, and facilitation.
  
 
To intervene as skilled practitioners, conflict-resolution professionals
 
need to understand how their worldview shapes the lens through which they
 
view and respond to conflict. Likewise, they need to grasp their

narratives influence both sides’ perception, emotions, and responses. As a
 
result of their reflective practice, students can learn to make more
 
strategic choices as negotiators, mediators, and facilitators.

NOPM PS5175,INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT: MANAGEMENT & PE,"This course examines how international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) can and often do contribute to social change, confronting and addressing various problems such as poverty, human rights violations, conflict, and climate change, among others. Students will leave with a deep appreciation of what it means to work in or with an advocacy-based NGOs. The course will help prepare them for future careers as an NGO leader, staff person, consultant, analyst, donor, or manager. Students will understand how NGOs are structured and the definition and differences between key concepts such as strategy, theory of change, governance, leadership, management, and program design.
  
The course will bring a scholar-practitioner perspective focusing on debates about strategy development, measuring impact, donor strategies, theories of change, institutional representation, diversity and equity, ethics, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement, campaigning, capacity-building, fundraising, resilience, sustainability, and external and internal communications.
  
The course will explore distinctions, similarities, and relationships among nongovernmental (national and international), government, and private actors as they seek to solve problems and have impact and create a better world. Throughout this exploration, we will identify major ethical issues raised by the very notions of charity, philanthropy and nonprofits. As a focus, the course will especially draw on examples from the international human rights movement, and often critically employ a “donor perspective” to draw out the hard strategic choices that INGOs (and their donors) are compelled to make. The course will also use documentary film about INGOs and their work, and various media produced about and by INGOs to help provide additional understanding.
  
The course will be discussion intensive and require students to utilize and reflect critical and analytical thinking; students will write individual papers, participate in group presentations, write occasional reflection papers, actively participate in discussion both in class and through postings on Canvas and present material to classroom colleagues.
  
This is an elective course in the M.S. Nonprofit Management Program and will be open, space permitting,  to cross-registrants.

advocacy practicum
 approach—designed to equip future nonprofit leaders with the skills to influence policy, mobilize communities, and drive systemic change.
  
In the context of the ever evolving policy landscape of New York City and providing a global lens, this course offers an in-depth exploration of advocacy fundamentals within the nonprofit sector. Through real-world case studies, hands-on projects, and interactive fieldwork, students have the opportunity to examine how advocacy efforts in New York City—a hub of civic engagement—can expand broader policy frameworks and cross into international contexts.
  
Over the term, students will explore the theoretical foundations of advocacy, including social movement theory, policy influence, and public opinion formation. They will engage in stakeholder analysis, coalition-building, and the creation of advocacy strategies tailored to shifting political, economic, and social dynamics. Central to this course will be discussions on how traditional advocacy approaches are being redefined in response to growing inequalities and systemic challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptable, intersectional strategies to confront global disparities.
  
The framework emphasizes practical application: students will have the opportunity to develop and implement real advocacy plans, leveraging digital tools, media, and virtual organizing strategies to enhance their impact. Fieldwork, simulations, and collaborative projects will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to tangible issues, empowering them to lead efforts that address pressing social challenges, whether locally in New York City or globally in areas such as international development and human rights.
  
Key topics include:
  
  
Crafting advocacy strategies that influence public policy in divided political environments;
  
Building and managing coalitions across stakeholders;
  
Engaging marginalized communities to ensure inclusive and equitable advocacy efforts;
  
Navigating the digital advocacy landscape to design impactful campaigns.

PEPM IA6620,Introductory Statistics,"This course introduces students to the fundamentals of statistical analysis. We will examine the principles and basic methods for analyzing quantitative data, with a focus on applications to problems in public policy, management, and the social sciences. We will begin with simple statistical techniques for describing and summarizing data and build toward the use of more sophisticated techniques for drawing inferences from data and making predictions about the social world.
  
The course will assume that students have little mathematical background beyond high school algebra. Students will be trained on STATA, which is supported in the SIPA computer lab. This powerful statistical package is frequently used to manage and analyze quantitative data in many organizational and institutional contexts. A practical mastery of a major statistical package will be an important proficiency for many of you down the road. You can obtain more information about your lab sticker at the SIPA lab, which is located on the 5th floor of IAB.
  
The formal mathematical foundation of statistics is downplayed; students who expect to make extensive and customized use of advanced statistical methods may be better served by a different course.

Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will.

Students will develop manual skills required to perform safe and effective soft tissue interventions in any clinical setting.
  
Soft tissue mobilization has been a part of manual medicine for millennia. This course introduces the theory, evidence, and practice of several common forms of soft tissue mobilization. The class begins with traditional massage that rely on basic theory and progresses to advanced techniques based on principles derived from current fascial theory. Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply soft tissue mobilizations that impact musculoskeletal system impairment of the upper-extremity, lower- extremity, and trunk. Along the way, students apply evidence-based practice concepts and knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, soft tissue pathophysiology in the experiential learning and discussion-based learning approach. Ultimately, students will be able to make logical clinical decisions that integrate soft tissue mobilization into an effective plan of care.

Liberal feminists may pursue “reproductive rights” and consider gender-equality the mark of feminist success. Social justice feminists seek nothing less than the end of sexism and all forms of subjugation (racial, class, sexual orientation ETC.) which sustain existing anti-egalitarian, sexist, racist and hetero-normative structures.

Keeping in mind the value of bringing different disciplinary attitudes to such a problem, this course supplements a purely scientific approach to Global Warming by calling on the many different ways that the human mind--and eye, hand, and ear--have sought to understand and react to our ever-changing environment. Students will begin by reviewing in the first week of the course the basic science of Climate Change and then studying the roots of our understanding of nature, including a variety of ancient religious texts and a wide range of Creation Narratives from around the globe. The second week of the course will be an introduction to a critical examination of artistic responses to Climate Change in recent decades. This will include Land Art that questions and tests our control over the landscape, a century of films that feature natural disaster scenarios, dystopian poems and short stories, music that seeks to represent the challenges of climate change in the auditory dimension, paintings and sculptures that visualize global warming, and performance art that uses the human body to dramatize the ways in we have been transforming nature.

This seminar will consider how capital, gender, race, culture, and power shape understandings of Wall Street in the popular imagination, and how people’s everyday practices reshape that understanding. Drawing on a variety of texts –anthropological, sociological, political-economic, historical, literary, and cinematic – we will examine the ways new forms of capital produce financial subjects, class difference, and crisis, within the global economy. We will also explore the ways Occupy Wall Street, Me Too, Black Lives Matter and other social movements are recapturing the radical imagination and the possibilities of new forms of resistance to capitalism that often intersect with sexism, racism, and other systems of power.

In doing so, we will read the work of major representatives of historical and contemporary political thought who assessed democracy’s shortcomings and potential, examined the relationship between its theory and its practice, and offered prominent resources for thinking about democracy’s future in our present.",David Ragazzoni,1:00pm,4:10pm,10277,,S3108-20252-D01,Democracy: Theory & Pract,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3108-20252-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20252POLS3108SD01,LECTURE
POLS UN3210,JUDICIAL POLITICS,"This political science course provides an introduction to the politics of judges, courts, and law in the United States.  We will evaluate law and courts as political institutions and judges as political actors and policy-makers.
  
The topics we will study include what courts do; how different legal systems function; the operation of legal norms; the U.S. judicial system; the power of courts; constraints on judicial power; judicial review; the origin of judicial institutions; how and why Supreme Court justices make the decisions they do; case selection; conflict between the Court and the other branches of government; decision making and conflict within the judicial hierarchy; the place of courts in American political history; and judicial appointments.
  
We will explore some common but not necessarily true claims about how judges make decisions and the role of courts.  One set of myths sees judges as unbiased appliers of neutral law, finding law and never making it, with ideology, biography, and politics left at the courthouse door. Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the “least dangerous branch,” making law, not policy, without real power or influence.
  
Our thematic questions will be:  How much power and discretion do judges have in the U.S?  What drives their decision-making?",Jeffrey R Lax,1:00pm,4:10pm,10283,,W3210-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3210-20252-001/,413 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252POLS3210W001,LECTURE
POLS UN3290,VOTING AND AMERICAN POLITICS,"This course explores causes and effects of political behavior in the United States. “Political behavior” is a broad concept, and can include many areas of engagement with civic life. As we consider “behavior,” we must also take on its foundations: Public opinion, ideology, and partisanship. We will focus primarily on mass politics—beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of ordinary citizens rather than of activists or elites—in the United States. However, we will also explore some effects of elite behavior on mass behavior. We will also focus on the interconnections between social structure, culture, and politics. In short, this course will focus on developing an understanding of the mechanisms that drive voting and other political behaviors in the United States.",Michael Miller,9:00am,12:10pm,10737,,W3290-20252-001,VOTING AND AMERICAN POLIT,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3290-20252-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252POLS3290W001,LECTURE

POLS UN3919,Seminar in Political Theory,"With the rise of extreme weather events as a consequence of climate change, the demand for “climate justice” has become a popular backdrop for environmental and climate movements to demand more specific political action to address the climate crisis. This course will cover the origins and development of the concept of environmental justice and its relationship to issues of race and power, as well as the transition from environmental justice to climate justice and its political implications today. Establishing the connection of environmental and climate justice principles to existing political institutions, the course will also include a field trip to visit South Bronx Unite and do a walking tour of heavily polluted waterways in the Bronx. Additionally, students will choose an institution or movement of their choice and create a report which analyses what concepts of justice these institutions refer to, what their goals and demands are, and how their strategies relate to these demands and where they might be falling short.",Rebecca S Marwege,1:00pm,4:10pm,10282,,S3919-20252-001,Seminar in Political Theo,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3919-20252-001/,306 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252POLS3919S001,SEMINAR
POPF P8698,Interdisciplinary Seminar in Population,"This course offers a forum for students to reflect upon specific public health topics within their field of study. Through discussion and presentation, students will have the opportunity to integrate their chosen topics into the public health curriculum, as well as to incorporate input and perspectives from other students' experiences. Through presentation and analysis, students hone their analytic skills, develop leadership capacity, and apply strategic communication techniques. This course forms a fundamental building block in the master's degree curriculum as students synthesize field-based learning with their classroom instruction and gain training for future leadership in public health.
The initial sessions will be led by faculty, who model seminar leadership and participatory discussion. Subsequent sessions will be co-led by students, who will rotate in this responsibility. In advance of each session, the lead students will work with faculty to refine the suggested reading list of documents or presentations for critical analysis and reflection. All participating students will prepare annotations and commentary, which will be available to other students, and will be a foundation for discussion in each session. An overall grade for such analysis will be awarded.
Students will present a brief list of key readings for a specific topic and a two-page outline of the proposed review for discussion before session 3. Students will start leading the discussion of those topics beginning in session 4 of the class. Where possible, the student(s) leading each session will have real-world work experience in that area. Students will be graded on their specific summary outline and the leadership of their class discussion. Students will then choose one topic to focus on, and will submit a final version of their review paper (to length and format required by the targeted journal) within seven days of the final session of the class (session 14).",Stephen P Kachur,,,12970,,P8698-20252-001,INTERDISP SEMINAR IN POPF,Population and Family Health,POPF,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POPF/P8698-20252-001/,,In-Person,,1.5,,,20252POPF8698P001,LECTURE

The course examines the phenomenon of hallucinations, in which the brain creates perceptual experiences that do not correspond to external sensory input. To explore this phenomenon, students will engage with a variety of media—such as podcasts, documentaries, and memoirs—alongside scholarly articles from fields like cognitive neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology. Drawing on case studies centered on the lived experience of hallucinations, we will investigate how key theories of the mind and brain influence the interpretation of first-person accounts and how, in turn, these accounts challenge and refine these theories. Guest lectures will enhance the case studies by presenting current and future directions in hallucination research. By integrating interdisciplinary academic research with first-person perspectives, this course offers students the opportunity to critically examine how knowledge of the mind and brain is constructed and how it can be applied in real-world contexts.

PSYC S3472,Psychedelic Neuroscience: From Molecules,"Psychedelics are receiving growing attention in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience for their therapeutic potential. Psychedelic compounds like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT produce a wide range of changes to perception, ranging from visual perception to alterations in one’s sense of self. When combined with psychological support or psychotherapy, psychedelics have been shown to lead to rapid and long-lasting therapeutic benefits for a wide range of mental health disorders, including major depression and alcohol use disorder. The acute alterations in perception and long-lasting clinical effects offer exciting insight into the relationship between the mind and the brain. This course will focus on the current state of research on the psychological and neurobiological effects of psychedelics. We will begin with a crash-course into the basics of neuroscience and research methodology. Next, the course will delve into how psychedelics alter brain functioning, both acutely during the drug effects as well as long after they have worn off. Studies covered will span molecular, cellular, and systems level analysis. A core element of the course will include reviewing methodological approaches and neuroscientific evidence for psychedelics interventions in the treatment of clinical/psychiatric disorders. We will also review the clinical data and link neurobiological findings to their practical application to move the field of psychedelic science forward. Throughout the course, there will be a specific focus on critical appraisal of research, identifying strengths and limitations surrounding current research, and important avenues for future research. Students should leave the class with an enhanced ability to evaluate research findings and a broad understanding of the mechanisms of action of psychedelics.
  
The format of the course will include lectures, class discussions and presentations, and guest speakers.

PSYC S4655,"The science of me, you and us:  insights","Why do we feel the way we do, how do we understand ourselves and others, and how does this relate to our social relationships?  Why does all of this sometimes leave us feeling anxious, depressed, lonely and isolated?  And when that happens, what we can do about it?  In this seminar, we will tackle these questions using an integrative approach that blends social psychology, clinical psychology and neuroscience to uncover how our emotions and social interactions sometimes work well and sometimes falter.  To do this, we will examine human behavior at multiple levels, connecting our social and emotional lives (what we experience and how we act) to cognitive processes (how our minds process information) and underlying neural mechanisms (what's happening in the brain).  As the semester unfolds, we start by building an understanding of where our emotions come from, how we can manage them, how we make sense of other people and how we can form positive connections with them.  This knowledge provides a foundation for taking the next step - understanding what happens when things go awry and we end up with momentary - or long-lasting - bouts of anxiety, depression, loneliness and other clinical conditions.  We end by considering what may be everyone’s life goal - the pursuit of happiness - and how everything we have learned can foster that pursuit through personal actions, social connections and psychotherapeutic support.  The overarching goal is to build a nuanced understanding of how and why we think and feel the way we do – about ourselves and others – that can inform both scientific and personal explorations of what “wellbeing” and “mental health” means.

PUBH P6032,RESEARCH METHODS & APPLICATIONS,"Successful public health studies, policies, and interventions rely on evidence to guide their design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Because public health is not a simple, reactive, “take the pill three times a day” solution, but a purposeful approach to preventing disease and promoting health, the tools of scientific inquiry to document, measure, evaluate, and understand all the consequences of health interventions are essential. Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed. The methods introduced in this course will provide a toolkit with which to help measure and estimate the relationships between the smaller pieces that comprise the complex and dynamic web of systems in public health.",Cheng-Shiun Leu,8:10pm,9:10pm,11200,,P6032-20252-D01,Quantitative Foundations,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6032-20252-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,0-4.5,,WR,20252PUBH6032PD01,LECTURE
PUBH P6795,Applying Community Engagement Principles,"The need for more effective and equitable engagement with communities has become increasingly evident to public health professionals in recent years. Now, more than ever, the importance of developing deeper and more engaged academic/institutional-community partnerships is necessary to address systems of structural inequity. However, developing these relationships requires not only knowledge of equity-based partnering formats, but the cultivation of complex skill sets that allow public health practitioners to fully develop relationships across all phases of community collaboration. Two valuable forms of community engagement that public health practitioners and students can make use of are community-based participatory research and service learning, which are the focus of the ACEP seminar. Additionally, this seminar acknowledges that community engagement is a diverse space where people from a variety of professional and personal backgrounds come together and provides knowledge and skills in important interprofessional competencies that are necessary for public ACEP Seminar, 2024 2 of 15 health professionals to understand and be able to deploy. For many years, people working in the technology space have recognized the benefits of “matrixed teams,” similarly over the past few years the notion of interprofessionalism has become an important and required aspect of allied health and public health professional training. Research has shown that bringing together students from two or more professions to learn about, from, and with each other is extremely effective in all forms of collaboration (within research and intervention teams and with communities) and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes. According to the World Health Organization, “Once students understand how to work interprofessionally, they are ready to enter the workplace as a member of the collaborative practice team. This is a key step in moving health systems from fragmentation to a position of strength.” The overall goal of the ACEP seminar is for students to learn about and begin to practice the tenets of three frameworks: Interprofessional Education (IPE), Service-Learning (SL), and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). Additionally, students will be supported in problem solving changes /problems that arise during their APEx. With regard to interprofessional engagement, the seminar will provide students with a solid understanding of four key IPE competencies: roles/responsibilities, teams/teamwork, ethics/values,",Carole L Hutchinson,5:00pm,6:30pm,12950,,P6795-20252-D01,ACEP Seminar,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6795-20252-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,0-1.5,,T,20252PUBH6795PD01,SEMINAR

QMSS GR5075,Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Social Sc,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI – like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Gemini – are poised to change the world for everyone. It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class – through readings and a dozen hands-on activities – students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI’s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people’s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI’s “weirdness.” Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills – like in critical thinking and empathy – in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, “So far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1/36th of the time, thanks to AI.

What are the standards for measuring justice and injustice? What is our relationship to the environment around us and how should its resources be distributed among people? How do we relate to those who are different from us, and what does it mean to be a community in the first place? Historically, the answers to these questions that have been described as “religious” and “political” have been the restricted to a specific tradition of Western European Christianity and its secular afterlives. However, these are questions that every society asks, in order to be a society in the first place. This course analyzes how indigenous peoples in the Americas asked and answered these questions through the first three centuries of Western European imperial rule. At the same time, this course pushes students to question what gets categorized as uniquely “indigenous” thought, how, and why.",Timothy Vasko,1:00pm,4:10pm,11268,,V3771-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),RELI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/V3771-20252-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252RELI3771V001,SEMINAR
RELI UN3881,"The Doctrine of Discovery: Religion, Law","How did European-Christians justify the colonization of the Americas? Did these justifications vary between different European empires, and between the Protestant and Catholic faiths, and if so, how? Do these justifications remain in effect in modern jurisprudence and ministries? This class explores these questions by introducing students to the Doctrine of Discovery. The Doctrine of Discovery is the defining legal rationale for European Colonization in the Western Hemisphere. The Doctrine has its origins in a body of ecclesiastic, legal, and philosophical texts dating to the late-fifteenth century, and was summarized by Chief Justice John Marshall of the United States Supreme Court, in the final, unanimous decision the judiciary issued on the 1823 case 
Johnson v. M’Intosh. 
Students will be introduced to the major, primary texts that make up the Doctrine, as well as contemporary critical studies of these texts and the Doctrine in general.",Timothy Vasko,1:00pm,4:10pm,11269,,V3881-20252-001,THE DOCTRINE OF DISCOVERY,Summer Session (SUMM),RELI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/V3881-20252-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,In-Person,,4,,TR,20252RELI3881V001,SEMINAR

It is one of the five senses we all share, a combination of nose and tongue, yet it also names an entirely subjective set of personal preferences that goes well beyond what we like to eat. This is why taste is a major problem for scientists and philosophers. If everybody’s sensory faculties work more or less in the same way, then how are we to explain the infinite variety of tastes that make us unique and our lives so interesting? In this class, we are going to do just that. We will consider theories of taste from the eighteenth century to today, including how critics, scholars, and scientists have attempted to define taste and to refine it. Beyond these questions, we will put theory into practice by tasting our way through some of the many artistic, literary, and culinary riches New York City has to offer.

The class will provide an understanding of the values and principles of RJ and R, and the most-commonly used RJ models and where they are being used. It will support students in understanding their own relationship to conflict and teach students how to facilitate restorative processes using peacemaking circles. Issues of power, privilege, oppression and identity will be substantial themes throughout the course, both in understanding the need for RJ and TJ, how RJ/TJ can address them, and the ways in which these issues arise in facilitation and the RJ/TJ movement.  In addition to understanding RJ, the course will also provide students with a critical analysis of other theories and practices of conflict resolution including mediation, truth and reconciliation, and transitional justice, and how all of these relate to addressing individual, communal and institutional harm.  Finally, the course will discuss how social workers can use restorative justice in a variety of settings.",Vivianne Guevara,5:30pm,8:00pm,12977,,T6724-20252-Z40,RESTORATIVE JUSTICE,Social Work,SOCW,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCW/T6724-20252-Z40/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20252SOCW6724TZ40,SEMINAR

SPAN BC3305,Sustainable Communities in Ecuador: What,"Indigenous people in Ecuador, which represent about 7% of the Ecuadorian population (United Nations, 2015), are disproportionately poor compared with the rest of the population. In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution. Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis. 
  
The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.  It aims to:
  
1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.
  
2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.
  
3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.
  
4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.
  
5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",Maria E Lozano,,,00083,,X3305-20252-001,SUSTAINABLE COMMUN.

Cost benefit analysis (CBA) consists of a comprehensive set of techniques used to evaluate government programs. It is now routinely applied in such program areas as transportation, water projects, health, training and education, criminal justice, environmental protection, urban policy and even in the international arena such as foreign direct investment. Many of the techniques of CBA can also be applied to private sector decision-making. The objective of CBA is to determine whether the benefits of a particular program, policy or decision outweigh its costs. The techniques used to determine this are sometimes quite simple, but on other, increasingly frequent occasions are highly sophisticated. Sophisticated cost benefit studies are based on a framework that utilizes the basic concepts of economic theory. In addition, statistical and econometric analyses are often needed to estimate program effects from diverse available data. The course has two parts: methodology and practice.

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.  Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked “experts only.”  The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.  Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",Lucius J Riccio,6:10pm,8:00pm,10878,,K5033-20252-001,DECISION MODELS & MGMT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5033-20252-001/,602 Northwest Corner Building,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252SUMA5033K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.
  
Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.

SUMA PS5470,CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR SUSTAINABILITY PROF,"Throughout history, societies have discovered resources, designed and developed them into textiles,
  
tools and structures, and bartered and exchanged these goods based on their respective values.
  
Economies emerged, driven by each society’s needs and limited by the resources and technology
  
available to them. Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the
  
overextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast
  
technological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of
  
the disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a “take-make’-
  
waste” manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our
  
planet’s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological
  
advancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;
  
which begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?
  
The premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative
  
economic future are available to us. By looking at resources’ potential, we can shape alternative methods
  
of procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,
  
products and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into
  
both the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and
  
restoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications
  
required in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially
  
transformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic

, 3 credits. 
Instructor:  
Nellie Hermann
, Adjunct Associate Professor, Barnard College; Core Faculty, Narrative Medicine; Creative Director, Columbia Narrative Medicine; Course Director, Narrative Medicine Certificate.
  
This course will plot a journey through a series of themes designed to examine what creative writing might be 
for
 as an applied practice (not only as an art): how can the tools of creative work connect us more deeply to the world around us, and therefore potentially transform any other endeavor we take on? Throughout the month, we will write and read – each week will feature a few different texts (all of them by French writers or by writers who lived in Paris)  which will form the background of the week’s work, and a particular piece of prose writing will be due at the end of that week. We will rely heavily on the city of Paris to be our teacher and guide in these various themes, and will involve the city in our explorations. In addition to the reading and generative exercises through each week, students will share one longer-form piece of writing with the group, and we will spend at least four class sessions workshopping these pieces as a group, with formal workshop letters due from students to underscore the attention they are giving to each other’s work.  
This course counts toward the Medical Humanities Major at Columbia University.

Instructor:

, Director of MFA in Poetry Program; Associate Professor of Writing, Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
  
At least since the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos called ""painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks,"" creative writing has existed in conversation with a variety of other art forms, particularly visual art. In this class, we will explore creative writing as an interdisciplinary practice, with an emphasis on the work of artists who create in both the visual and textual fields. Among other key critical questions, we will consider:
  
1. How has an intersection with visual art been important to creative writing historically?
  
2. How does visual experience relate to particular aspects of creative writing?
  
3. How can we use visual art towards our own creative process in the future, either by using visual art in writing or by incorporating illustration in the presentation of our written work?
  
A mix of texts—classic and contemporary poetry and prose, illuminated manuscripts, children’s picturebooks, literature that we might consider 
visually-driven
, and related scholarship­­––form the basis for our investigations, discussions, and creative work.

WRIT S4313,WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS,"There are many misconceptions as to what makes an appealing story for children and how to get a story published. Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",Peter Catalanotto,10:00am,1:10pm,10517,,S4313-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4313-20252-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT4313S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,5:30pm,8:40pm,10518,,S4320-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4320-20252-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20252WRIT4320S001,SEMINAR

We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project.

WRIT S4324,MISFITS AND MISANTHROPES,"People like to be liked. And writers obsess about likability in fiction. But is it that important? What about visionaries, iconoclasts, stragglers, strangers, weirdos, and cringe-inducers? What happens when there is friction between a person and their surroundings? Between people? What if a character throws aside motivations to be liked and impulses to comply?
  
At its heart, this is a class focused on analyzing and crafting characters. We’ll look at loners and lonely hearts, articulate big mouths, and introverted self-imploders. We’ll observe their circumstances and question how their desires encourage them to think and act. Students will regularly respond to prompts and workshop their own writing.
  
Our discussions will consider what choices writers make to render, shape, define, and refine characters. We’ll take on craft-oriented concerns such as: How is dialogue used to differentiate characters? How does a writer demonstrate a character’s compassion, even if their attitude stinks? How do the story's events affect the reader’s understanding of character? What elements in the narrative change—or don’t—over time to signal to the reader that a character is developing?
  
Throughout, students will investigate how emerging writers move from maintaining characters’ status quo and progress to allowing characters to do the unexpected. With every question, we will advance our comprehension of building dynamic representations of people in the world, how they act out, and what it takes to fit in.

Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,1:30pm,4:40pm,10519,,S4810-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20252-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:30pm,4:40pm,10553,,W3215-20252-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20252-001/,409 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20252WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
