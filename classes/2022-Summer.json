While television advertising represents just one method of affecting consumer sentiment (video ads), digital is far more complex, offering video, search, social, email, and more.  In this introductory course, students will learn how marketers leverage digital media to promote and sell products. Students will come to understand the inner workings of multiple digital media platforms (e.g., search, video, display, gaming, et al.) and the strategies and tactics marketers employ to influence consumers. In addition, students will explore the ethics of big data and privacy, as well as develop an understanding of how marketers use digital media to influence consumers.  The course culminates with a final project presentation which allow students to put into practice topics and theories about digital media and advertising covered during the course.  This course has no prerequisites and is appropriate for anyone interested in the fields of marketing and media, as well as those interested in the topic of persuasion and how corporations influence consumer behavior.",

Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",

Using case studies some straightforward and others extremely vexing--this course examines the many ways in which authenticity is measured through the use of provenance and art historical research, connoisseurship, and forensic resources. From within the broader topics, finer issues will also be explored, among them, the hierarchy of attribution, condition and conservation, copies and reproductions, the period eye and the style of the marketplace.",

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts. Students will have the opportunity to meet museum educators, conservators and curators through on site teaching in a variety of institutions.",

The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.\u00a0 With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",

    "course_descr":"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors\/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.  Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and\/or national level.  Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.  In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",

    "course_descr":"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts\u2014C.L.R. James\u2019 The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Aim\u00e9 Cesair\u00e9\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi\u2019s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth\u2014this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",

We will cover topics like rites of passage and life cycle, the role of the nation state and local communities in defining a person, the relation between self and non-self, between the living and the dead. We will likewise address vicarious forms of personhood through the prosthetic, the avatar or the heteronomous. But we will also\u00a0look into forms of dissipation and\/or enhancement of personhood through bodybuilding, guinea-piging and pharmo-toxicities. As a whole, the course will bring to light how the question of personhood cross-culturally relates to language, performativity, religion, technology, law, gender, race, class, care, life and death.",

    "course_descr":"A two-course curricular option for students wishing to develop their appreciation of art and architecture. Both courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis, skills that will be valuable to students in whatever fields they choose to pursue in college and beyond. Numerous field trips to museums and architectural landmarks throughout the city enable students to take advantage of New York\u2019s vast cultural resources.  \nWhat is Art History?\n \n This course introduces students to selected monuments of painting, sculpture, and architecture and to basic trends and concepts in the history of art. Examples are drawn from a wide range of periods and cultures. Students are introduced to aspects of visual analysis, historical context, and problems of interpretation. Participants engage in discussions centered around slide presentations, videos, and, most importantly, field trips.  One of the objectives of the course is to consider how the way art is displayed can enhance or detract from its power. To this end the class visits sites such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hispanic Society, the Cloisters, the Frick Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art.  \nWhat is Architecture?\n \n An introduction to ways of understanding architecture framed around four topics: Concept, Context, Form, and Materials. Students are challenged to examine and understand the effect of physical environment on human experience, the factors that influence architectural forms, and the role that architecture plays in shaping our behaviors and civic cultures.  Students will gain an understanding of architecture through slide presentations, discussions, readings, visits to museum exhibits, and on-site observations and analyses of architecture and public spaces in New York City, both iconic and lesser-known. Past field trip destinations have included the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Lincoln Center, Times Square, and the Highline, a public park built on a former elevated railway.",

Classroom environments are intimate and collaborative, and students learn by engaging actively with the subject matter, the instructors, and their peers. The focus throughout is on learning to think clearly, critically, and creatively.  \nExpository Writing\n  The process of writing is emphasized as students learn to write through a \"building block approach\" which concentrates on how relatively simple-meaning relationships and rhetorical strategies within an essay combine to yield intricate and sophisticated results. Attention is paid to developing skills in grammar, diction, usage, syntax, and punctuation.  \nCritical Reading\n  Analyzing fiction and nonfiction trains students to identify and critically respond to the messages conveyed by different kinds of writing. Emphasis is placed on understanding how formal characteristics such as rhetorical strategy, point of view, and diction condition the reader's perception of content.  \nAcademic Skills\n  In conjunction with writing and reading exercises, students also acquire techniques for effective study and research. Study skill sessions and tutorials teach practical skills such as note-taking, outlining, summarizing, managing time, and using research tools. Toward the end of the session, each student delivers an oral presentation, thereby honing public speaking and presentation skills.",

Understanding architecture in a historic context can enrich our experience of traveling, or of merely walking down the street where we live. It helps us connect our personal spaces and neighborhoods to places and cultures from different times, geographies, and cultures.  Participants learn to recognize and describe the formal characteristics of architecture broadly described as Classical, Medieval, Victorian, Modernist, and Postmodernist, while recognizing that few buildings are designed in a \u201cpure\u201d or exclusive idiom. We analyze historic and modern images of buildings which exemplify the most recognizable styles of each era, both in the United States and abroad. When possible, we visit New York city sites whose architecture represents or evokes one or more styles under discussion.",

Through discussions of challenging readings that encompass the political, social, technological, and economic aspects of the field, students are introduced to selected architectural themes. Class discussions are supplemented with architectural tours of the Columbia University campus and visits to prominent works of modern architecture in New York City such as the Whitney Museum, the High Line Park, Grand Central Station, and the Seagram Building.  The afternoon studio class, conducted as a creative workshop, introduces participants to the conceptual skills employed by architectural designers. Instructors provide students with training in technical drawing and introduce them to the process of conceptualizing and developing architectural ideas.

How have feminist artists navigated systems meant to oppress them, and can they operate within these systems successfully? We will explore how the trauma informed personal story can be utilized for art making, fame building, accumulation of resources and healing, and how this can be both beneficial and compromised.

In this course, through formal lectures and hands-on wet lab activities students gain an appreciation for the role of engineering in performing biological research.  We focus on how biomedical engineering modeling systems are used to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms through which cells in the human body respond to physical stimuli (chemical, electrical, mechanical). This information can then be directed toward the development of cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine strategies, such as functional tissue engineering, for tissue and organ repair.  Intensive lab sessions, making up half of the course, take place in the Department of Biomedical Engineering\u2019s undergraduate laboratory, which contains facilities for cell and tissue culture, microscopy, and data and image analysis. Students in fixed groups rotate through a series of three-day lab projects.",

This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the \u201cdata economy,\u201d in which data is the \u201cthe new oil\u201d\u2014a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.  We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.  From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.  Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.  Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations. The course features real-world applications of data analytics across industries and challenges students to think in terms of the business value of data and machine learning.",

Topics covered include the biological importance of water, hydrogels, macromolecules that compose food, vitamins and minerals, carbon compounds and generation of ethanol, risks and prevention of disease, and recombinant DNA technology. Global applications of genetically modified foods, use of monosodium glutamate, turmeric, and omega-3 fatty acids are critically examined.  Experiments with food use candy and fruit to build models and fruit for extraction of DNA. Food dyes, pop rock candy, milk, shampoo and toothpaste are used to perform microscale experiments.  Participants engage in thought-provoking discussions to help them dissect the science behind newsworthy stories about issues such as weight-loss drugs, different diet concepts, fluoride or lead in water, and the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola, cholera, and hepatitis. Participants are evaluated based on class participation and homework assignments.  \nPlease note: In-class experiments, because they use everyday foods, are conducted in a traditional classroom rather than in a laboratory.",

The firm needs cash to undertake worthy investments, and the firm needs to identify investments worth undertaking. What models does the firm use to identify such investments? What sources of cash can the firm use? How do the financial markets in which this money is raised function? How does the market value the firm, its securities, and its investments? What financial instruments are available to the firm? What are the microeconomic models that best describe a firm\u2019s behavior in such markets?  In answering these questions, the participants discuss stocks, bonds, stock markets, as well as valuation models of investments, firms, and securities. They also work with concepts like optimal investment strategies, what is revealed and what is hidden in published accounting statements, and what are some of the sources of risk. Students also acquire familiarity with the mechanics and history of the financial markets.",

In this course we explore a number of key issues having to do with the space industry and the emerging space economy with the intention of preparing participants to be leaders in those fields.  Potential topics to be covered include:  \n  \nHow private businesses are changing the new space race\n  \nWhy space commercialization will lead to a Fifth Industrial Revolution\n  \nWhat old and new financial models are enabling the growth of space technology\n  \nThe role of NASA, the Space Force, NOAA, and other government agencies\n  \nShould we be investing in space when there are so many challenges facing humanity on Earth?\n  \nHow do businesses profit from working within the space economy?\n  \nWhat does the work of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin tell us about opportunities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the moon, and Mars?\n  \nWhat steps a business must go through to be part of the new space race\n  \nHow new private and national programs will add to the complexity and vibrancy of the economy\n  \nWhat is the role of space in human rights?\n  \nHow does the improvement of communities in space lead to social and technology improvements?\n  \nWhat environmental problems can be solved using space technology?\n  \nWhat is the role of traditional financial institutions such as banks and mutual funds, and how does that compare to the role of family private offices, VCs, and hedge funds in disruptive industries like the space economy?\n \n  The course draws on fundamental concepts in business, economics, and finance and applies new concepts from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, risk management, and social impact measurements. Participants gain a foundational understanding of business development, the importance of intellectual property, and the value of community building as part of any business strategy - how solving for space is really about solving for problems on Earth. Guest speakers represent the private sector as well as groups such as NASA, the Space Force, and international space organizations.  Students leave with the tools to place an economic lens on the business, technology, and financing of spaceports, the aerospace industry, space adjacent technology, and the space economy as a whole.

In this course we examine the functioning of medications such as antibiotics, antiviral drugs, chemotherapy, and psychiatric drugs. We also look at the molecular biology and treatment of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and auto-immune disorders such as lupus.  Class time is devoted to interactive lectures and in-class assignments designed to help students understand the connections between science and medical treatments. Outside of class, participants are expected to write a number of short essays exploring how various modern medical treatments work on a cellular and molecular level.",

Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of \u201ctruth\u201d in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.  Appropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

    "course_descr":"Each year cybercriminals steal hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of information from major companies and vital national security secrets from governments, while terrorist organizations leverage cyber-networks for distributing their media and recruiting. It is imperative to nurture the next generation of intelligence professionals to understand the cyber-threat landscape given its ubiquitous impact on our daily lives.  In this course participants are exposed to cyber-threat intelligence as a discipline and its function in providing decision-makers with the support they need to stay abreast of evolving security challenges. Case studies on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and large cybercrime networks are examined so as to better understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); their successes; and their shortcomings. Further, we look at technology\u2019s evolution and how it is integrated into our lives along with the likely future threat landscape that accompanies these technologies.  Threat intelligence encompasses more than the government, considering all private companies are reliant on technology and have their own threat intelligence teams, so this course focuses on both the public and private sectors.  Course readings cover the topics of intelligence, analysis, advanced persistent threat groups, cybercriminals, terrorist organizations, and the different methods these actors use to conduct their attacks and operations. We discuss these topics in greater depth in class lectures and with guest speakers. Students produce short white papers and work on group presentations in which they represent threat intel teams focusing on particular entities.  \nPlease note, this is not a computer science class and no technical expertise is required.",

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",

    "course_descr":"This course explores contemporary human rights issues in fiction, nonfiction, and film from Africa, Latin America, South Asia, the Caribbean, and the U.S., as well as humanitarian-inspired art, documentaries, television, and music circulated around the world. When decolonial and indigenous writers and cultural workers decide to represent violence in their countries, they risk reproducing racist stereotypes that permeate international media. And yet, human rights violations tied to war, slavery, sexual violence, religious fundamentalism, and ethnic strife are central features of turbulent national histories\u2014including our own in America. How can twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers from the Global South and beyond undermine the harmful stereotypes and dominant narratives that predetermine their stories in the international public sphere without reproducing stereotypes? To better understand strife abroad, we will take an interdisciplinary feminist approach to the politics of representing human rights. Our readings, paired with options for extracurricular events like film screenings in New York City, will prompt us to reflect critically on the ambivalences surrounding human rights in global culture. We will engage literary representations of historical events ranging from the Holocaust to the Vietnam War and the Rwandan genocide, all the way up to extremism in our present moment. Final projects invite students to reflect on methods for representing human rights through creative writing. This course, which fulfills the University Global Core requirement, as well as English major requirements for prose fiction\/narrative and comparative\/global literature, will appeal to students of not only literature but also in human rights, history, political science, African studies, law, and gender and sexuality studies.",

City diplomacy is generally considered to start in 1913 with the creation, at the Universal Exposition in the Belgian city of Ghent, of the first global city network, the Union Internationale des Villes.  Since its beginning, city diplomacy emerged as a field where cities\u2019 values and idealism are implemented through a pragmatic and cooperative approach that progressively expanded its scope. The rise of such practice was driven by the desire to foster reconciliation among former enemies of the Second World War through direct interaction between residents in the framework of twinning agreements. A few years later, city diplomacy accompanied the process of decolonization by creating a solid bond of friendship between cities in former colonizing and colonized countries. In the 90s, city diplomacy widened its scope to include enhancing the city\u2019s positioning in the global economy. Today, city diplomacy is best known for its impact in addressing the main transnational challenges (including climate change, migration, violent extremism, and urbanization) through a methodology featuring horizontal partnerships with cities from all over the world and a vertical, participatory approach engaging and empowering residents and local stakeholders.  Through an innovative approach cutting cuts across the boundaries of traditional disciplines (international relations, urban sociology, area studies, history, geography), \u00a0the course will combine the emerging scholarly literature with a comparative accent linked to the analysis of primary sources from cities and international actors from all regions of the world. As a result, students will learn to connect global and regional macro-dynamics with micro-transformations at the local level, while gaining an in-depth understanding of city diplomacy's core features, management, tangible impact, and evolution.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the \nColumbia Summer in Paris Program\n\u00a0through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).&",

    "course_descr":"Climate change is one of the world\u2019s most critical challenges, and though quite prominent in today\u2019s news it remains a complex and multifaceted issue. What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?  Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.  Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).  Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers. Students are expected and encouraged to participate in class discussions, raise questions, and contribute to small group exercises and presentations.",

We read sophisticated texts and analyze them, identifying rhetorical strategies, unstated assumptions, and hidden subtexts. We examine a variety of literary genres such as essays, fiction, poetry, journalism, and speeches; time permitting, we branch out into visual forms such as painting, graphic novels, and film. Participants become not only more insightful readers but also more nuanced thinkers.  \nWriting and Research Skills\n  Students are provided an overview of the techniques essential for successful academic writing, with particular emphasis placed on argumentation and organization. While reviewing the basic components of strong writing through discussion of argument structure, essay organization, style, and mechanics, we also engage in creative activities and discussions aimed at strengthening analytic and rhetorical skills. Students also learn the fundamentals of scholarly research, with special attention given to library and online resources, source evaluation, and bibliographic format. While the focus is on expository writing, the kind of writing called for in academic essays and term papers, we also branch out into narrative and personal writing, as required for college admissions essays.",

While it originated in digital web design and user experience, content strategy now encompasses a much broader set of considerations and addresses content creation, distribution, and governance across multiple channels, especially the interplay among digital, social, and traditional media. Content strategy provides a holistic approach for unlocking the value behind content and for increasing its effectiveness in achieving business and organizational objectives. This course will present the fundamentals of content strategy and explore the discipline\u2019s approaches, techniques, and tools that course participants can apply directly to the content situation in their own organization. It will draw parallels with \u2013 and highlight distinctions among \u2013 traditional communication strategy, publishing, and content strategy, and provide students with a framework to create a sustainable program grounded in meaningful, actionable content.",

    "course_descr":"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don\u2019t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds \u2014 structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works \u2014 creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",

Optimization and probabilistic strategies are explored so as to demonstrate tradeoffs between different types of search strategies (blind search, local search, and adversarial search). Several well-known problems\u2014such as N-Queens, Knapsack, Post correspondence, and Chess\u2014are discussed, and we look at how the Deep Blue system was able to win a chess game against a reigning world champion.  Participants are expected to complete challenging and thought-provoking assignments using the techniques taught in class as well as their prerequisite knowledge.

Writing a personal essay is not only a process of self-discovery\u2014it is also the work of becoming the person capable of writing the essay.  In this course, we learn to write true stories about ourselves, the cultural artifacts and places we care about, the identities we hold in relation to power, and the ways our experiences change us forever. With the goal of producing up to three compelling personal essays, we explore the process of personal writing, from generating ideas to revising drafts. To become captivating narrators, we practice drafting skills essential to all nonfiction writing, drawing from reporting, research, and our personal archives\u2014be it text messages, photos, or journals\u2014to enhance the emotional specificity and intellectual rigor of our personal narratives.  Part seminar and part workshop, this course introduces students to the genre of personal nonfiction and the practice of critiquing writing as a group.

    "course_descr":"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing\/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.  A primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.  By the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.  \nNote:\n\u00a0While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",

    "course_title":"Contemporary Debates in American Law and",
    "course_descr":"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing\/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.  A primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.  By the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.  \nNote:\n\u00a0While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",

Each session develops the students\u2019 approach to various materials, composition, and personal narratives into completed works that can be used for a final portfolio. Students have prolonged time to study and sketch the human figure from live nude models in class. Ideas are explored through assigned writings and developed in a sketchbook throughout the course.

In this course we aim to reconnect with the imaginative power of dreams primarily by writing and interpreting our own, while reading extensively in dream literature.  While composing and sharing our own dreams on a daily basis with foremost attention to dreams as a source for discovery and literary artistic production, we experiment with a variety of compositional, mnemonic, and lucid techniques. Readings and audio-visual texts from writers, theorists, and filmmakers such as Patricia Garfield, Jeremy Seligson, Robert Moss (especially his \u201csix masters of the \u2018three only things\u2019\u201d), Joan of Arc, Lucrecia de Le\u00f3n, Harriet Tubman, Mark Twain, Wolfgang Pauli, Winston Churchill, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Richard Linklater provide guidance and inspiration.",

Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 \/day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",

    "course_descr":"Extreme climate and weather events can lead to cascading failures that can spread within and across socio-environmental systems and sectors, often disproportionally affecting underserved communities. Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent, and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a \u00a0changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent, \u00a0synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies, \u00a0from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.\u00a0  This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world events in which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year-long\u00a0with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighborhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.\u00a0  Guided by recent literature quantitative and qualitative frameworks that aim at assessing current and future climate risks to turn them into a",

    "course_descr":"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.  With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University\u2019s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.  Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.  Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another\u2019s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",

The course will consider such topics as integrative and distributive bargaining; barriers to agreement and ways to overcome them; negotiation skills such as listening, communication, and persuasion; the determinants of bargaining power; client relationships; negotiation ethics; and the role of culture, gender, and race in negotiation. Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in role plays, to keep a weekly journal in which they analyze their negotiation experiences, and to participate in a final project comprising a 60 to 90-minute one-on-one negotiation and a 10 page written analysis of that negotiation.\u00a0  Because of the experiential and team-based nature of the coursework, class attendance is required. If you anticipate missing more than one class session, you should not take the course. Unanticipated absences due to illness or similar supervening circumstances will be accommodated as is reasonable; makeup activities may be required as part of the accommodation. \"",

Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker\u2019s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do the particularities of various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers and artists create a visual aesthetic based on their local contexts that is distinct from westernized visual narratives of queerness? How do images of queerness circulate globally and how might queer visual cultures of the Global South push back against existing paradigms of queerness in the Global North? All films for the course are subject to change, but may include titles such as \nRafiki, A Fantastic Woman, Happy Together, The Wound, Portrait of a Lady on Fire. \nAdditionally, we will read critical and theoretical works that will urge us to consider these films from a range of perspectives, such as queer studies, feminist film studies, disability studies, and transgender studies.",

You will hone your skills of observing, describing, questioning, analyzing, and persuading. You will be challenged to confront complications and to craft nuanced explorations of your topics. We will also regularly read and discuss the work of contemporary published essayists, identifying key writerly moves that you may adapt as you attempt your own essays.\u00a0 You will have many opportunities throughout the semester to brainstorm ideas, receive feedback from me and your peers, and develop and revise your drafts. At the end of the semester, you will choose a publication to which to submit or pitch one or more of your essays.",

On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester\u2019s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare\u2019s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",

By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",

We will examine the cultural anxieties that attend new media, stretching from Plato\u2019s \nPhaedrus\n\u2014where Socrates warns that the advent of writing will destroy people\u2019s memories\u2014to today, when Nicholas Carr asks \u201cIs Google making us stupid?\u201d The clay tablet, the codex, the printing press, the chalkboard, the telegraph, the typewriter, the pdf, computer coding, and the smart phone have each promised to revolutionize the reading and writing publics, access to power, and even how people think.  This course examines those promises within their historical contexts, through critical study, and using hands-on experiences. For instance, we will study the role of clay tablets in upholding ancient empires at the same time that we craft our own clay tablet texts. We will take notes with ink pens while we study the role of Medieval scribes in spreading Christianity and Islam. We will create \u2018zines while studying the Riot Grrl movement. And we will create our own html hypertexts (no prior coding experience required) as we read the earliest hypertext fiction. These hands-on experiences move arguments about the dangers and revelations of writing technologies out of the realm of the hypothetical and into the realm of the experiential.  The class will visit Columbia\u2019s Rare Book and Manuscript Library (RBML) and Barnard\u2019s Zine Archive, where we will look at textual artifacts, from ancient papyri to early print and digital texts. Our approach will prepare you to situate the contemporary textual technologies you take for granted (IMs, Twitter, Google Docs, and so on) within the long history of new media. And it will teach those pursuing literary studies, new media studies, and computer science research methods required to examine a text as a technology.",

We will talk about the pleasures of those texts, as well as their formal and generic features, their language and their relation to literary history.\u00a0 But we will also discuss the idea and institution named \u201cSally Rooney,\u201d considering it as what Michel Foucault called an \u201cauthor function,\u201d or what Pierre Bourdieu dubbed a \u201cspace of possibilities\u201d within the literary field.  Our inquiry into \u201cSally Rooney\u201d will, therefore, also be an inquiry into the meaning of literary authorship in the twenty-first century. Through secondary readings in criticism and theory, we will engage longstanding arguments about the relation between critical interpretation and authorial intention, as well as between social and historical \u201ccontext\u201d and authorial and aesthetic autonomy. We will examine how patterns of social exclusion \u2014 in this case, race \u2014 define the digitally-mediated literary field of the present. And we will ask how the rise of social media and online retail have altered ideas and institutions of authorship, audience, and literariness.",

Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: \u201cI\u2019d been thinking: it\u2019s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.\u00a0 But lately I\u2019m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.\u00a0 That the best is over,\u201d Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.\u00a0 Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order): \nThe Sopranos\n; \nThe Wire\n; \nDeadwood\n; \nMadmen\n; and \nBreaking Bad.",

Beginning with an exploration of the aesthetic debates and cultural contexts that animated Harlem in 1920s to 1930s, the course will also take up the legacy of Harlem as a location important in creating a \u201cracial\u201d art in\/for a diverse, global community comprised of differences in gender, class, sexuality, geographic and national origin.  In summer of 2022, the course will place relations between African American and New Negro cultural production in dialogue with Black European conceptions and experiences of race and belonging by exploring the work and lives of two AfroScandinavian artists in particular: African American and Danish writer Nella Larsen and AfroSwedish hip-hop artist, writer, and activist Jason Diakit\u00e9. Author of the Harlem Renaissance novels Passing and Quicksand, Larsen dramatized the complexities of belonging in places with stark racial regimes that are inflected by gender, sexuality, and geography. Born in the 1970s to interracial American parents in Sweden (his father hails from Harlem) Diakit\u00e9 also grew up between worlds, riding a delicate cultural and racial divide. Diakit\u00e9 and Larsen share the task of unifying a complex system of family roots across continents, ethnicities, classes, colors, and eras; they both yearn for and problematize what it means to come home to Harlem. In June of 2022, Diakit\u00e9 will perform the stage version of his memoir, A Drop of Midnight at Harlem Stage\u2014 Diakit\u00e9 will visit the course to discuss his personal and artistic journey and we will also study and see a performance of A Drop of Midnight, in collaboration with Harlem Stage.",

Why does the novel appear?\u00a0\u00a0What role does it play,\u00a0in personal psychology as well as society?\u00a0 Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?\u00a0\u00a0To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.\u00a0\u00a0Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen.\u00a0Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,\n Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.\u00a0\u00a0Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",

    "course_descr":"Bring your love of truth, justice, mystery, and New York City history to this writing class. Studying the elements of the city\u2019s well-known, and not so well-known crimes, can open a lens into the race, class, and gender structures at work in our metropolis, and reveal whom they benefit, and whom they harm. The current explosion in True Crime books, podcasts, blogs, and documentaries, and the fact that women are taking control of more of these narratives cannot be ignored. Students will choose an actual criminal case from New York\u2019s recent or not so recent history (e.g. Typhoid Mary), and write a nonfiction story driven by their point of view, which will emerge from shorter pieces and research done during the class. The coursework will cover best writing practices, such as learning the skills of legally sound, ethical reporting, interviewing people on sensitive matters, and using public records\u2014all in the interest of uncovering and shaping the raw material into a story that needs to be told, for victims who may not always have the tools to tell them. Readings will include Michelle McNamara\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Gone in The Dark, Becky Cooper\u2019s We Keep the Dead Close, James Polchin\u2019s Indecent Advances, and excerpts from Christopher Payne\u2019s photography book, North Brother Island, the Last Unknown Place in New York City. We will take virtual tours of public archives, the Museum of the City of New York, Central Park, and The East River, listen to Laci Mosley\u2019s Scam Goddess, and view documentaries and films such as Strong Island, The Witness (about Kitty Genovese), and Summer of Sam. Experts on various topics will also participate as occasional guest speakers in the class.",

The second half of the class will be spent in performance. We will study current spoken word performances, voice training techniques, and intersections between acting and poetic theories. Students will critique each other\u2019s individual deliveries, collaborate on group performances, and ultimately construct an hour long performance synthesizing a semester\u2019s worth of work.

    "course_descr":"In The Arguments in Your Head: Playwriting Workshop, we\u2019ll explore and develop the foundational skills, techniques, and instincts that you\u2019ll need to write a full-length play. The goal of this class is not to write a perfect play (doesn\u2019t exist!) Rather, the goal is to let go of what you think you should be writing to impress others and instead learn to become the stewards of your own urgent questions and aesthetics principles. This workshop will be process-focused rather than outcome-focused. As your teacher, my concern is not perfection\u2014 I care about pulse. Everyone will be bringing in new, unfinished work that is a little raw and uncomfortable. No one knows what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re all in the same boat! My goal for you is not to get stuck when you get lost (because if I do my job right you will get lost), but instead I hope to give you tools that help you find your way in the dark, take bold risks, and above all keep going. Every play is different and has its own rules. In order to fashion those rules autonomously we have to learn to listen deeply, follow an inarticulate hunch, and above all, be willing to fail. Be brave, playwright! This is where the wildness lives, where all the scary fun is to be had. And in the end\u2026 it\u2019s just words on a page, ink on paper\u2014 you can always tear it up and start over. By the end of this class, you will have written a draft of a full-length play, learned how to give thoughtful feedback on the plays of your classmates, and developed a more critical eye to the plays that you read.",

Of particular interest is the role of women in Harlem, as farmers and traders in the Native American, Colonial, and early American periods, to writers, musicians, and sculptors during the Harlem Renaissance, to the current generation of uptown politicians, artists, and educators.

    "course_descr":"Intended for students interested in creating new business ventures or social enterprises, this hands-on course focuses on the creation, evaluation, development, and launch-readiness of new business or social ventures. Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format. For each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.  Students work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class, they refine their venture\u2019s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership. By the end of the class, participants have generated robust business models, with supportive venture plan documents, investor pitches, websites, and crowd-funding videos.",

In learning about these particular topics, students gain a more general understanding of some of the most important concepts underlying much of U.S. law.\n \n We analyze the law of nuisance and trespass through the lens of Pokemon Go, and we look at the legal concept of negligence by examining product liability issues arising from injuries related to autonomous vehicles and SnapChat filters. The class then explores how the right to privacy is impacted in the physical world by drone technology, and how privacy interests are impacted in the digital world by data gathering platforms such as Facebook. We look at legal issues having to do with the future of money, gaining a basic understanding of blockchain and its role in cryptocurrency and fractional asset ownership through tokenization. Finally, through a study of \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, we explore advertising, marketing, and contract law through a case study of the infamous Fyre Festival.\n \n Students learn through a combination of lecture, discussion, debate, and group work. Content and learning examples are presented in various forms, including PowerPoints, short videos, images, in-class demonstrations, and a guest speaker. Students complete a culminating project involving an oral small group presentation.\n \n Through this immersive learning experience, participants gain a broad understanding of the law as well as enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills. They learn how to approach complex, dynamic legal problems and methodically analyze all relevant factors so as to arrive at logical, evidence-based results. Further, they practice collaborative co-creation and public speaking as they work in small groups on their culminating oral presentations.",

Often these communities are people of color, indigenous, or living in poverty. From the city planner Robert Moses to the waste transfer stations disproportionately located in the Bronx, the rate of asthma for that area is one of the highest in the country. As our country plans to drill for oil and gas and create pipelines, who is impacted and what is the cost? What is the impact of deforestation? With global climate change, poorer countries are already facing life-threatening consequences. This course will examine the disproportionately damaging impacts of climate change and other environmental justice issues in the United States and abroad, and discuss viable proposals for resolving these issues.",

    "course_descr":"Most broadly, ethics is concerned with how it is best for us, as human individuals and communities, to live \u2013\u00a0how we understand and relate to ourselves, each other, and beyond. What goals or values should we pursue? What kinds of lives are good and worthy of choice (for anyone)? What moral duties do we have \u2013\u00a0are there individual actions or social policies which are (morally) required or forbidden? And to whom or what do we owe them \u2013\u00a0in virtue of what do entities have moral standing? Is acting morally good for us and, if so, would this compromise the ethical worth of so acting? What is the source of our knowledge, if any, about these matters, and how do we resolve conflicting answers to these questions?\u00a0  While attending some to \u2018meta-ethics\u2019, the course focuses on normative ethics and its application. After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics \u2013 consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly \u2018Kantianism\u2019 and \u2018contractualism\u2019), and some of the traditions of \u2018virtue ethics\u2019. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech.\u00a0  Our authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois.\u00a0  The course has three main goals for students: \n1\n) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives \u2013 historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western \u2013 on ethics; \n2\n) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct\u00a0(logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; \n3\n) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly.\u00a0  There are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",

    "course_descr":"In this course students explore fashion with a particular focus on style and culture in New York City and then develop their own designs.  Participants get a first-hand look at the field through discussion with active figures in the fashion industry such as designers, marketing directors, and stylists. They take virtual field trips to locations such as the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Readings on the history, theory, and culture of fashion include works by icons, artists, writers, editors, philosopher, and activists such as Diana Vreeland, Susan Sontag, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Rudofsky, and Marilyn Bender. As a springboard for inspiration and discussion, we view the works of a variety of designers through film clips and videos. Through our explorations into fashion as art we encounter individuals who live and enact fashion through performative dress, at times challenging social and gender expectations  Having gained a firm grounding in the field, participants research and formulate their own original fashion concepts. Based on these concepts, they design their own unique collections. Concepts may center on a particular motif (e.g., technology as an extension of the human body), period or style (e.g., British monarchy, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt, imagined future, underwater or deep space), or material inspiration (e.g., mylar, fiber optics, recyclables, etc.). While sharing sources of inspiration and research discoveries with attention to both craft and theory, in addition to producing our individual collections, we engage in a collaborative design project.",

    "course_descr":"FILM4325GU\n \n: Waves on Different Shores: Film in France, Japan, Brazil. 3 points. \n  \nInstructor:\n Richard Pena  \n\u200b\nTaught in English.\n  \nThis course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. \n  In the early 1960s, a number of new film movements emerged in national cinemas around the world. Called \u201cnew waves\u201d or \u201cnew cinemas,\u201d these movements, made up of young filmmakers, would challenge the cinematic industrial structures in each of their respective nations, as well propose both radically different approaches to filmmaking and to cinematic storytelling. Perhaps inevitably, these films and filmmakers would also be drawn into larger political discussions about the futures of their respective nations. This course will explore three important examples of this development\u2014the French New Wave, the Japanese New Wave and the Brazilian Cinema Novo\u2014detailing both the commonalities among these movements (aesthetic, social, technological, political) as well those factors which made each unique. Among the filmmakers included will be Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Nagisa Oshima, and Glauber Rocha. The relationship of these respective \u201cnew waves\u201d to simultaneous radical experiments in visual arts, theater, literature and music will be a special focus of the course. A watershed moment in film history that would forever change the way films were made, financed, seen and discussed.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n \nColumbia Summer in \nParis\n program through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\u00a0).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply\n \n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates.",

We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR\/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda.

The course provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of finance, emphasizing their application to a wide variety of real-world situations in corporate decision-making and financial intermediation.

What was once deemed a public value focal point has blossomed into a prudent investment strategy as research has indicated that companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainable business practices, in the long-run, outperform those that do not. The result has been a mass migration towards ESG and Impact investing.  This course is an introduction to socially responsible investing and an overview of the differences between ESG and Impact Investing. We investigate the relationships between ESG investing, outperforming market returns, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  The materials presented in class as well as class discussions empower students to answer questions such as:  \n  \nHow can investing be reconciled with sustainability and achieving the sustainable development goals?\n  \nWill ESG investing become the norm rather than the exception?\n  \nWhat are the links between green finance and ESG investing?\n \n  Through a mix of introductory finance and asset management theories, class colloquia, and investment case studies, students gain an understanding of the challenges and opportunities embedded in sustainable investing.",

    "course_descr":"With an increasing complexity, financial markets exert a powerful presence in our lives and are central to the functioning of our economy. What role does the stock market play and how does it function? What factors govern stock market behavior and lead to market booms and busts? How is the price of a company\u2019s stock determined and how does it affect individual investors? This challenging course introduces the basic financial principles necessary to understand the role of the stock market in our economy and in our personal lives.  Class time is divided between lecture and lab. Participants assume the role of money managers in order to gain an understanding of financial markets as they manage their own portfolio of stocks in a session-long stock market simulation game. Stock options and future contracts are added to the portfolio as the managers gain market expertise. Financial theories presented in class lectures, news of current and world events, and analysis of company reports are incorporated as the new money managers develop strategies to test their understanding of the market for stocks.",

    "course_descr":"A two-course curricular option that provides a concentrated study of aesthetic concepts for students interested in the visual arts. Both courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis, skills that will be valuable to students in whatever fields they choose to pursue in college and beyond. Numerous field trips to museums and architectural landmarks throughout the city enable students to take advantage of New York\u2019s vast cultural resources.  \nArchitecture and Society: New York\u2019s Built Environment\n  This course introduces students to the visual analysis of architecture. Instead of surveying the history of architecture, we look at specific New York landmarks to understand how great structures not only fulfill practical needs but also influence our relationship to the physical and social world around us. By studying some of New York\u2019s notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. As students learn to \u201cread\u201d these sites closely, they become familiar with the basic vocabulary of architecture (including light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same basic elements to different ends.  Some of the sites we explore together typically include Columbia University\u2019s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9\/11 Memorial.  \nProblems in the History of Art\n  This course covers selected monuments of painting and sculpture from various eras and cultures as well as basic trends and concepts in the history of art. Students learn about art from both the artist\u2019s perspective (focusing on materials and technique) and the art historian\u2019s perspective (focusing on issues of patronage, context, and interpretation), with both ultimately impacting how we view these objects in the modern world.  The goal of this class is to examine specific objects and encourage students to think about formal analysis\u2014understanding the choices artists make, as well as how these objects reflect upon their specific culture and era. Rather than addressing the subject of art history in the traditional survey fashion, this course will be topic-based, with particular emphasis on how curatorial decisions impact the way we view works of art.  Field trips typically include visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,",

Through encounters with leading figures of today\u2019s French literary scene (e.g.: authors, publishers, literary agents, guest speakers) students will also learn about the global pressures (e.g.: economic, social, political and ideological) that are placed on French literature today, and the ways in which global demands inform the conditions in which literature is being read and produced.

This film history course will function as a journey in which we explore contemporary French cinema. Our itinerary will take us from the 1990s, those of \u201cyoung French cinema\u201d and neoclassicism, to the end of the 2010s, those of directors like Julie Delpy and Christophe Honor\u00e9. Together, we will develop a panorama in which the works of C\u00e9dric Klapisch and Nicole Garcia will intersect, as well as those of C\u00e9line Sciamma and Arnaud Desplechin.  The objective of this course will be to introduce students to French cinema, its history and its diversity. We will also have the chance to correlate academic knowledge and practical experience, so as to give the students a significant idea of French film activity. The application process is competitive and will take place onsite in February.

The course enables students to understand, speak, read, and write in German about a range of subjects (such as: family activities, studies, work and home life, as well as travel, economics, and current events) and helps them develop an understanding of German speaking cultures. Classes are conducted in German and supplemented with written homework and audiovisual materials. Assignments and activities are diversified to integrate undergraduate and graduate students\u2019 academic and personal interests. The program draws on the German heritage of New York City (museums, Goethe Institut, restaurants, etc.). Students are encouraged to attend German-language films and musical performances. Students have many opportunities for informal conversation. Upon successful completion of the course (with a minimum grade of B), students should achieve novice high to intermediate low proficiency (ACTFL scale). Final grades are based on frequent oral and written tests, writing assignments, a project on German culture in New York, and a final examination (written and oral). Students are advised that this course constitutes a full-time commitment. The workload of this course is very intense and students will be expected to spend 4-6 hours studying every day outside of class and additional time on weekends. The Department of Germanic Languages will assist in selecting the appropriate course.\u00a0Equivalent to the combination of\u00a0\nGERM UN1101\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nUN1102\n\u00a0taught during the regular semesters.

    "course_descr":"The course begins by introducing international relations theory and practice, evolves into the evolution of the international order and concludes by discussing great power competition and economic statecraft.  The first half of the course presents theoretical and practical frameworks for understanding international politics and the policy decisions that shape global outcomes. It considers major international trends, such as the rise and fall of great powers, cooperation and conflict between states, and the influence of non-state actors on security, economics, and politics. With an emphasis on contemporary world affairs, it also explores the institutions, interests, ideas, and personalities behind international events. Foundational knowledge will be conveyed by looking at key historical events and the evolution of theoretical concepts that frame our understanding of international relations and informs policy. Each class meeting will use illustrative historical\/contemporary cases to link theory to real world policy formation and execution.  The second half of the course, which builds on the material covered in part I, examines challenges to the current global order in a world of growing political, economic and military competition. We will examine the rise of great power competition among the United States, China and Russia and use of economic statecraft as a principle tool to advance each country\u2019s interest. This part of the course examines each of these actors from an economic viewpoint, proceeding from the premise that a national economic base provides the resources from which these nations provide for domestic living standards while at the same time resourcing their national security objectives. The course provides an overview of each nation in context to its regional and the world economy. The course will examine contemporary and projected trends for each nation and relate these to security and strategy.  This is designed as an economics course for those who are interested in international relations but who do not have a deep knowledge of macro-economics. The instructor will familiarize students with basic macroeconomic concepts and provide a framework for inquiry which the course will apply to each of the actors. The course will then draw conclusions for strategy and decision makers.",

Instructor: Dimitris Antoniou  The Practicum's participants will be registered for the course \"Public Hellenism,\" which will meet daily from 10:00-11:00 (with the exception of a few days when it will meet 10:00-12:00). This course consists of three parts.The first part (weeks 1 and 2) introduces students to public humanities and Greek history and culture, is structured around an examination of\u00a0\nSNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece\n, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).  The second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.  Throughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).  \nCourse Objectives\n: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia. \nThe \nStavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative\n (SNFPHI) is sponsoring the program and will cover the cost of the\nVergil",

Students will learn hands-on strategies for fostering inclusion at every level of the organization, and how and why it matters on the overall culture and climate of the organization in a systematic way. Class discussions, assignments, and readings will pose questions such as: How to foster a culture of inclusion? How do we know when inclusion is actually taking place?",

Recent events have fundamentally affected organizational operations, employer\/employee expectations and relationships, perceptions of social justice\u00a0 and the perceived role and value of organizations within society.  Human Capital Management professionals are charged with stewarding their organizations to adapt to these changes and to anticipate and prepare for others. Managing Human Capital in organizations will require new ways of thinking, experimenting, and developing methods to creatively facilitate an environment that will produce high performance from employees. In this course, students will explore disruptions in the workplace and workforce, understand their impact, and develop their capabilities as HCM professionals to lead through the resulting changes, now and in the future.",

Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",

Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as \u201cLatinas\/os\u201d \u201cHispanics\u201d or \u201cLatinxs\u201d today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina\/o\/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and \u201cnewcomers\u201d to American society. This course aims to place Latina\/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:\u00a0 Who are Latinas\/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?\u00a0 Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?\u00a0 The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.\u00a0 Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.\u00a0 The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups\u2014Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student\u2019s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the\u00a0\nGlobal Core\n\u00a0requirement, which is reflected on the\u00a0Columbia online registry.\u00a0\u00a0The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits.

Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties.

    "course_descr":"Few periods in history have stirred imaginations and been debated as much as the so-called \u201cAge of Revolution\u201d at the turn of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Long seen through a self-righteous North-Atlantic lens, this era of (democratic) revolutions has today been decentered both spatially and conceptually to encompass other revolutionary upheavals around the globe and their twin other: empire. This course takes stock of these developments to explore how revolution and empire developed in tandem in France and Haiti, with ramifications across the Caribbean, Europe and beyond from 1789 to 1820. Topics covered include: the end of an \u201cold\u201d regime and birth of several new ones; the largest and most successful slave revolt in history; revolutionary politics and social transformation; the terror; Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture, and charismatic leadership; the first \u201ctotal war\u201d and new forms of empire-building; the legacies, memory, and forgetting of these events. Throughout, the course considers revolutionary upheaval and imperialism as intertwined processes driven both by determinate logics and by unintended consequences.  This course is lecture-based although students are expected to engage in short document-based discussions in class. All classes and readings will be English, and no prior knowledge of the period is required.",

Caught between Western Europe, its remaining colonies, and the young nations of Central and South America, the United States struck a tense balance between imperial and anti-imperial tendencies. This course examines the transformation of the United States from an insular conglomeration of states to an imperial power. Alongside political debates in Washington and diplomatic wrangling in North America, South America, and Europe this course centers western expansion as a defining feature of the United States\u2019 internal and international identity, placing the U.S.\u2019s violent dispossession of indigenous peoples and commitment to slavery in conversation with other formative events like the Mexican-American and Spanish-American Wars.",

Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II.

This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.\n \n In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.\n \n In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.\n \n Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities.

Course assignments stress observation while focusing on experiments with materials so as to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition, use of charcoal and pencil, graphic\u00a0drawing\u00a0techniques, wet media, color theory, and optical illusions.  The course combines studio work, including the study of the human figure using live nude models, with outdoor drawing, individual and group critiques, and visits to major museums and art galleries. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week in the form of a short seminar, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.  Participants also learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications, and the session concludes with a group show to which parents, friends, and other program participants are invited.",

Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today\u2019s venture success stories.  Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching \u201cshark tank\u201d style in front of a group of experts.  Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.  Upon successful completion of the course, participants will have created fully realizable business models. They will have also honed key professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.",

Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives\u2014given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most of that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least comparatively speaking, a fact that makes the foreign exchange market an ideal platform for derivatives. The emphasis is on familiarizing the student with the nature of the foreign exchange\u00a0market and those factors that make it special among financial markets, enabling the student to gain a deeper understanding of the related market for derivatives on foreign exchange.",

    "course_title":"Filmmaking with iPhone & iPad",
    "course_descr":"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker\u2019s Sundance feature film,\u00a0\nTangerine\n, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary,\u00a0\nSearching for Sugar Man\n, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.  Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.  In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones\/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, sound \u2013 so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.  In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools\/career paths.  On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.  Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",

The need for expertise goes far beyond having the best idea. It is knowing how to create an idea using a process that builds collaborative relationships and ensures successful adoption of your expertise.  \u00a0  Drawing on examples from a variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies and tactics for designing services and products for organizations or institutions. The entire course and assignments will focus on working with a client to assess the environment, create a prioritized business case, and conclude with an implementation plan. Topics will include whole systems development, strategies for engagement, diagnosis to discovery, ethics and managing your consulting relationship, change management, and establishing yourself as a trusted advisor.  \u00a0  This is a hands-on course where students are expected to identify an existing consulting assignment (internal or external) that we will work throughout the class to help their client improve its effectiveness and competitiveness.

    "course_descr":"For-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike, are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, foster pluralism, and innovate. For example, realtor COMPASS, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and electric cooperatives are all leveraging networks. The ideas of \u201copen\u201d and \u201ccollective\u201d are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.  \u00a0  \u201cNetworked Work\u201d presents the structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:  \u00a0  \n  \nsocial networks\n  \ncommunities of practice (or knowledge-networks),\n  \nopen source,\n  \nopen data, and\n  \nopen innovation.\n \n  \u00a0  Students will envision, diagnose and design networks for \u201ccooperative advantage.\u201d We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, social influence, sustainability challenges, and technology advancement.",

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

The top priority of Ukraine's foreign policy is to ensure international support for its efforts to rebuff Russia\u2019s full-fledged aggression and to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Can diplomacy still play a role? What is to be done to solve existing internal problems? What is to be done to restore the country? Can Ukraine\u2019s president, its government, and parliament solve all these problems? Is there a future for UN peacekeeping operations in Ukraine? These and other issues, including international assistance to Ukraine, behind-the-scenes activities, power struggles, and diplomatic endeavors are analyzed in the course.

    "course_descr":"Students in this beginner level filmmaking course learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques which allow them to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. Participants collaborate on short film projects while building a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.  In the first portion of the class, students learn the basic principles of cinematography and gain hands-on experience with film production equipment as they progress from basic equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. Each student takes on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, sound \u2013 so that each experiences different facets of film crewing. Collaboration is emphasized as students work together to create three initial short pieces before moving on to collaborate on a final film.  Each exercise leading up to the final film is intended to introduce a new element of filmmaking. In this final project, students collaborate and work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools\/career paths.  On the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants. The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

Do you want the same stuff your friends have; do you want to be part of the \u201cin\u201d crowd; and what do your clothes say about you?  In this course students examine multiple ads and promotional programs, read about how companies try to reach consumers, and discuss consumers\u2019 responses to companies\u2019 programs. They explore how companies advertise and promote their products to the consumer.  The morning session is devoted to lecture and class discussion. In the afternoon, students are often divided into small teams to do hands-on and group work and present their findings to the class for Q&A. As a final project, they work in teams to create, brand, and develop a comprehensive written marketing and communications plan for a new product, which they also present to the class.",

How can this framework be applied to philosophical thought? One topic covered is game theory (how mathematicians study decision-making), which has applications in fields such as economics, biology, and psychology.\n  \nCounting and Probability: Abstract counting, in the form of combinatorics, serves as an introduction to set theory, which in turn sets the stage for probability theory. As an application, the class delves into cryptography, looking at how math can be used to create and read secret messages.\n  \nAdvanced Topics: In the final week, building on what we have done already and depending one students\u2019 interests, we look at a few advanced topics. Potential topics include planetary orbits, symmetry, topology, common statistical fallacies, and Markov chains.\n \n  After exploring these various applications of mathematics, participants select and complete a group project based upon their own interests within the field.

Python is an interpreted language that, while syntactically simple, is equipped with a powerful set of libraries. Data analysis, machine learning, AI, data visualization, and web development can all be done quickly and efficiently with Python. This makes Python an ideal language for beginners.  Participants learn the fundamentals of programming with Python; they are introduced to best programming practices, data representation and storage, data structures, functions and scripts, and more. Students also learn how to take advantage of the incredible number of Python libraries. By the end of the course, they have an understanding of the programming fundamentals required to approach novel and interesting problems with Python.  The course alternates between classic instruction, group work, and individual programming challenges. While learning to code in Python, students also develop logical thinking and problem solving skills that will be helpful to them in learning other programming languages as well as in college and beyond.",

Students will generally find that they also have an improved grasp of modern Japanese grammar and will also gain experience in using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries.

It is designed to give students a systematic and intensive introduction to the grammar of classical Japanese. Texts are taken mainly from the Heian and medieval periods, though texts from later periods will also be introduced. It is expected that by the end of the course students will have acquired a firm foundation in classical Japanese grammar and will be able to read classical Japanese texts with the aid of a dictionary. Students will generally find that they also have an improved grasp of modern Japanese grammar and will also gain experience in using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries. The course will also include some instruction in reading cursive Japanese, primarily variant kana (hentaigana).  A \nsample syllabus\n is available for reference.  \nCourse Schedule: \nThe course will be taught Monday-Friday in a four hour block (with two short breaks), and the current plan is to hold class from 8 am to 12 noon EST. As part of the application process, applicants will be surveyed about their schedules and it is possible that some adjustments will be made to the class meeting time to accommodate participants in different time zones. The final course schedule will be determined and shared with potential students prior to when students need to confirm participation in the course.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the \nKyoto Consortium (KCJS) Summer: Classical Japanese Program\n through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE). \nGlobal Learning Scholarships\n\u00a0available.\u00a0\u00a0\nTuition\n\u00a0charges apply.  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates.",

Could it be, for example, that the \u201creal world\u201d in which we believe ourselves to live is actually a computer program, \u00e1 la\u00a0\nThe Matrix\n? If not, then how can we know that this is not the case \u2013 what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge \u2013 what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference \u2013 would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways \u2013 if we actually are living in the Matrix?  In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato\u2019s\u00a0\nRepublic\n\u00a0and Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019\u00a0\nMeditations\n, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.  This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students\u2019 abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.  Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",

    "course_descr":"In this course students examine language as a vital part of culture and social structure while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We first tackle assumptions and myths we hold about language. For example, can animals learn to use language? Do Eskimo languages really have 17 separate words for snow? Is English the hardest language to learn? Then we explore the components of language (phonemes, morphemes, words, and sentences) and how each plays a role in what we hear as an \u201caccent\u201d or dialect. Thus, students investigate both the structural and cultural functions of human language.  The course employs a multi-disciplinary approach to investigating language behavior and variation in different cultures. This occurs mainly through the term project, which provides each student with the opportunity to conduct fieldwork as a means to research a culture and its use of language. Participants come to better understand themselves as members of their own cultures and language as a shaper of our self-identities in human society.  In the morning sessions we examine material in a seminar format. Afternoons are devoted to research, analysis of case studies, and other hands-on applications including probing popular culture, literature, and film for evidence of language used as a way to define cultural and social identities.  Students develop the skills of data collection and cross-linguistic and cross-cultural analysis and come away with a perspective of multiple viewpoints related to language correctness and relativity.",

We focus mainly on shorter fiction and poetry, but may also look at excerpts from some longer works.  We consider not only the meanings of the works but also what it is about how they are written and constructed that gives them their power. While the focus is largely on close reading and formal analysis, we also look at historical context and pay attention to how literature sounds and makes us feel.  Modern literature has had close ties to trends in visual art, music, theater, and film and so we may consider works from these other art forms and how they reflect back on written texts. We will likely visit the Museum of Modern Art and perhaps another major museum.  Course participants are expected to contribute actively to class discussion, write a number of informal reaction pieces, engage in a few short creative projects, and prepare oral presentations on works of their own choosing. Students learn how to read actively, think analytically, present their ideas coherently (in both written and spoken form), and collaborate with their peers\u2014all skills that will be invaluable to them in college and in their personal and professional lives.

We look at how probabilities are applied in economics and in popular media, and examine how they can sometimes be counter-intuitive or even deceptive.\n  \nVarious counting methods, combinatorics, and examples of Nash equilibria. We study applications of these techniques in economics (the prisoner's dilemma), computer science (assessing the complexity of an algorithm), finance (loans and investments), and biology (population growth).\n \n  Students work individually and in groups to find creative solutions to given problems.

It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a prior i background in the life sciences is assumed.  This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.

The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the \u201cGlobal Core.\u201d The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world\u2014where the false binaries of \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe Rest\u201d no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",

    "course_descr":"This course explores a broad range of questions concerning the relationship between the media and politics, with a focus on historical and contemporary issues presented in the American context: Do the news media educate or manipulate the citizenry? What is the role of the press in a democracy and how does the First Amendment protect the press in the United States? What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing \u201cweaponization\u201d of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America\u2019s system of democratic government.  Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",

    "course_descr":"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.  We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.  Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",

We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one\u2019s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.

Its signature is change in all its manifestations, from events that happen on a geological time scale to those that happen instantaneously, from the cosmological to the subatomic scale. Chemistry provides powerful scientific tools that extend our ability to sense the magnitudes of change by stretching the limits of what we know of our universe.  Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry is designed for highly motivated students who want to strengthen their understanding of chemistry and current research methods. The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a presentation by senior faculty members and researchers that is expanded upon through small group discussions and laboratory experiences.  Topics have been selected because they stand out as essential themes of current research, illustrate the methods of science, lend themselves to historical development, and highlight the role of chemistry as the central science. Through integrative experiments and collaborative projects, students discover the synthetic and analytic dimensions of chemistry in forensic, environmental, and materials problems. Experiments emphasize the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills.  Formal training includes instrumental methods in spectroscopy, chromatography, magnetic resonance, and computer simulations with state-of-the-art equipment in the department\u2019s modern laboratories. Guest lecturers and field trips to area research facilities round out the program. Students are expected to complete a small research project, prepare a scientific paper, and participate regularly in class discussions.",

    "course_descr":"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials\u2014the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today\u2019s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures\u2014bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures\u2014light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.  In this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.  Students investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia\u2019s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",

    "course_descr":"How has the US\u2013China trade war affected the growth of world economies? Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?  This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.  Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers \u2013 i.e. export (supply\/origin) and import (demand\/destination) hubs \u2013 along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.  Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources \u2013 including those that are sustainable \u2013 and their effect in the global landscape.  Students gain an understanding of \u2013 and think critically about \u2013 various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates\/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",

This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict. \nPrerequisite: NECR 5105 Introduction to Negotiation\n.",

Drawing from the disciplines of social psychology and clinical psychology, political science, international relations, and the latest advances in neuroscience, conflict resolution practitioners have at their disposal a wealth of research that can inform their analysis of how to assist parties to mitigate, de-escalate, and prevent conflict.\u00a0\u00a0  Building especially on the material covered in Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (PS5101), the participants in this class will engage with the course readings, instructors, and each other to critically analyze and deconstruct complex conflicts in a variety of contexts.\u00a0A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used in the effort to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Multiculturalism, negotiation and mediation frameworks, accounting for bias, interdependency, intergroup conflict, social identity, peacebuilding, and power dynamics are among the key learnings integrated into the course.  The competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life. Students will be empowered to reflect critically on a text, select relevant data, understand the applicability of a theory, and offer results-based recommendations in contexts ranging from global to personal.",

    "course_descr":"No one organization or sector has the full suite of capabilities, relationships or assets to tackle persistent and escalating social problems such as poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, equitable access to education and health care, among others. As public resources dedicated to societal benefit become scarcer and calls for accountability become more urgent, the public sector increasingly is turning to public-private partnership (P3) models. Consequently, these models and approaches are becoming as multi-faceted, systemic and global as the challenges they aim to address, with increased opportunities for philanthropy and the non-profit sector.  \u00a0  The term \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d is often misused to identify mostly a shifting of risk from government to a private partner in exchange for an up-front payment. A true or \u201cauthentic\u201d P3s generates collective benefits that exceed what individual partners could achieve on their own. This course will examine, through readings and case histories, P3 partnerships that involve the sharing of risks and rewards between public, private and nonprofit partners, where the sector-specific expertise and assets of multiple stakeholders are tapped and valued for innovation in the design, delivery and management of cross-sector projects and services. The emphasis will be on the role of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector as equal partners in all aspects of these shared-value partnerships. Students will consider questions about entrepreneurship, nonprofit leadership, and service: How should core public services be financed? What is the most effective way to manage day-to-day operations of public services? What does it mean to be accountable to the public? Examples are drawn from public health, education, international development, urban renewal, and others.\u00a0  \u00a0  This is an elective that builds on the Nonprofit Management Program\u2019s core curriculum and is designed for all Nonprofit Management Program students and, space permitting, is open to cross-registrants from other fields and\/or Columbia University programs (other SPS programs; Teachers College; Business School; Mailman School of Public Health; SIPA). Students should have a strong understanding of the nonprofit development sector in the US; familiarity with international fundraising practices also is welcome.",

    "course_descr":"This course provides a rigorous analysis for the design and management of a major,\u00a0leadership and campaign fundraising\u00a0program in the majority of nonprofit organizations. This class will examine the strategic skills to incorporate these initiatives into a balanced philanthropic program. From donor acquisition in an Annual Giving Campaign to The Ask for a Leadership Gift in a Capital Campaign, there will be an emphasis on understanding the donor and developing relationships. Students will learn how to identify major gift prospects from\u00a0a strong annual giving program, build a major gift program,\u00a0organize fundraising campaigns, establish a timeline, introduce explicit leadership expectations, and develop strategies to maximize the collective resources of volunteer leaders, donors and colleagues. Students will also explore how to position special gift opportunities within the context of a long-range strategic planning process.  Fundamental to a\u00a0well-rounded\u00a0fundraising curriculum, this course\u00a0examines integrating, positioning and administering a major, leadership and campaign fundraising program within the context of a strong and robust development operation. The course explores such necessary and interrelated elements as: the identification of new prospects at every gift level, an understanding of what to look for in prospect research examination, various ways to cultivate donors of all levels to find those who can make the highest level gifts, a range of solicitation strategies with an emphasis on face-to-face asks, retention\u00a0and stewardship of donors;\u00a0the utilization of mission-driven or individual-driven major gift cases for support;\u00a0the diverse psychological and emotional motivations of contributors;\u00a0the development of meaningful working relationships with volunteer leaders; campaign strategy and preparation;\u00a0and targeted solicitation strategies for responding to the unique personalities, interests,\u00a0and needs of high capacity\u00a0donors.  Critical thinking will be encouraged and ethical concepts central to the performance of philanthropic practices will be explored throughout the semester. Finally, the course examines qualities and skillsets of successful major gift officers and campaign fundraising, helping students become familiar and comfortable with the process of working with all development staff to build a strong major gift program, facilitating and managing the leadership ask, and participating in a comprehensive fundraising campaign.",

    "course_descr":"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.  The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.  Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?  Some of the topics that may be addressed include the\u00a0\nFrye and Daubert\n\u00a0standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.  The course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",

    "course_descr":"An experiential, immersive course designed for students interested in the urban environment, culture, literature, history, and public policy. The course comprises four interconnected modules (see below). Two days each week are reserved for fieldwork in New York City with city policymakers, philanthropists, and artists.\n \n \nNew York City: A History of People, Politics, and Place\n What is New York City\u2019s relationship to the American Dream? How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the other aspects in the course. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.\n \n \nWriting the City\n How is our experience of New York \u2013 the city\u2019s projected image and self-image \u2013 shaped by literature about the city? Using short stories, poems, popular song, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon. Beyond this examination, writing in the field enables students to reflect upon their experiences in the city and acts to tie the various threads of the course together while remaining true to the singular experience of each course participant.\n \n \nUrban Place Design\n What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city? We study various answers to this question \u2013 public\/private partnerships (e.g. Bryant Park), the NYC Department of Transportation Plaza Program, public parks (e.g. Central Park), privately-owned public spaces, and business improvement districts \u2013 in order to learn the fundamental dynamics of public space in New York City. Armed with that knowledge, we select a location and design our own proposals for public spaces. We also examine how previous urban designers, such as Robert Moses, sought to overcome the challenges faced in constructing (and reconstructing) the city \u2013 and how those solutions often have ramifications for today\u2019s NYC. Fieldwork: visiting and evaluating public plazas, meeting with designers and policymakers at the NY Department of Transportation, Neighborhood Plaza Partnership, and Times Square Alliance.  \nEmerging Urban Issues\n Course instructors and invited experts intr",

    "course_descr":"This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.  We begin by reading and discussing Plato's\u00a0\nSymposium\n\u00a0and Aristotle's\u00a0\nNicomachean Ethics\n, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom\u2014a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia? \u00a0  Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s concept of existential freedom found in\u00a0\nBeing and Nothingness\n\u00a0and Soren Kierkegaard\u2019s religious freedom from\u00a0\nFear and Trembling\n, which Donald Palmer introduces in\u00a0\nDoes the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy\n. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work\u00a0\nThe Myth of Sisyphus\n. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.  In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",

As we progress through issues directly related to epistemology, we will also see that these issues connect up with important issues in other areas of philosophy as well (e.g., metaphysics and moral philosophy).  We engage with such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own positions concerning these issues. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  \n  \nTo acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.\n  \nTo develop an understanding of how issues concerning epistemology are of relevance to not only other areas of philosophy, but disciplines besides philosophy as well.\n  \nTo accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers\u2019 works on fundamental issues in epistemology, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.\n  \nTo critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.",

We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds.

What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?\n \n We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.\n \n Course readings include such influential works as Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's \"Sensations and Brain Processes,\u201d Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Mental States,\u201d and Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cWhat is it Like to be a Bat?\u201d Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.\n \n The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",

    "course_descr":"At the end of the Cold War, many in the West celebrated what they perceived as not only a political victory over the Soviet Union but also the intellectual and ideological ascendency of liberal democracy. And yet three decades later many liberal democracies are facing numerous challenges, if not outright crises.  This course explores the key political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world that seek to challenge, improve, and even threaten liberal democracy. We begin by asking what an ideology is, before delving into the various -isms including liberalism itself, capitalism, socialism, communism, populism, and nationalism. We investigate how these ideologies shape societies and mold social behavior, exploring their origins and principles. We ask how these ideologies intersect with democratic governance and offer different understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship. Our goal is not to determine which ideology is best but rather to understand and critique the many different ways of thinking about politics and society. We draft initial ideology statements, to be revised during the course as students reflect on and question their own assumptions and beliefs through engagement with different perspectives. Participants also engage in debates with their peers in order to practice articulating arguments in a persuasive manner.  Morning sessions are normally dedicated to reviewing and clarifying the assigned material, which includes classic and contemporary works in political theory as well as news and magazine articles and film clips. In the afternoon, students apply their understanding in group activities including debates, and engage with guest speakers from various ideological positions.  By the end of the course, participants not only better understand the key ideologies of the modern world but are also equipped with the analytical tools to critique and revise them in a forward-thinking way.",

We will focus on applied problems using real data wherever possible, using R's ``Tidyverse.'' In total, in this course we will cover concepts such as reading data in various formats (including ``cracking'' atypical government data sources and pdf documents); web scraping; data joins; data manipulation and cleaning (including string variables and regular expressions); data mining; making effective data visualizations; using data to make informed prediction, and basic text analysis. We will also cover programming basics including writing functions and loops in R. Finally, we will discuss how to use R Markdown to communicate our results effectively to outside audiences. Class sessions are applied in nature, and our exercises are designed around practical problems: Predicting election outcomes, determining the author of anonymous texts, and cleaning up messy government data so we can use it.",

Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.

But machines that process information do not seem to\u00a0\nfeel\u00a0\nanything; a computer may for instance receive inputs from a video camera, yet it would be hard to imagine that it\u00a0\nsees\u00a0\nor experiences the vividness of colors like we do. This course explores behaviors by understanding the influences of biological processes. What does a prototypical neuron look like? How do neurons talk to each other? How does neuronal communication produce behavior? Then we will move into asking deeper questions like: what happens in the brain when you want to move? why do we dream? How do we form memories? Nobody has yet provided a convincing theory as to how to explain the subjective nature of our mental lives in objective physical terms. Over four weeks,\u00a0\nCSP23\n\u00a0attempts to provide a strong introductory foundation to the field of human neuroscience.  Each week we will review a neuroscientific field, by following the four main components of the scientific method:  \n  \nObservation and formulation of scientific questions\n  \nData collection and analysis\n  \nAccurate and transparent communication of results\n  \nHigh-level discussion of the findings and future directions and societal relevance\n \n  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\u00a0\n\u00a0Columbia Summer Practicum: Neuroscience in Paris\n\u00a0program, through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply.",

Having gained an understanding of these concepts, students explore new technologies in areas such as renewable energy, virtual reality, and biotechnology.  Participants explore material conductivity by building circuits, assemble a physical model for understanding conversion of energy, experience virtual reality through Google glasses, write onto computers directly from brain signals, and work with MATLAB to create simulated models. They also work in groups on projects that they present at the end of the course.  Lectures and hands-on experiments are supplemented by tours of Columbia's research laboratories and visits to locations such as The Museum of Natural History, The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath), and The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum.  \nPlease note that hands-on work for this class is conducted in a traditional classroom rather than in a laboratory.",

This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",

After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python.

Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal\/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ). The class ends by examining the efforts of American and European Muslim communities to carve out distinct spheres of identity in the larger global Muslim community ( umma) through expressions of popular culture (e.g. Hip-Hop).",

(c) What is the relationship between science and religion? (d) Is it reasonable to believe in an afterlife for beings like us?  We broach such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own views. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  \n  \nTo acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.\n  \nTo develop an understanding of the different branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy.\n  \nTo accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers\u2019 works on fundamental issues in philosophy of religion, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.\n  \nTo critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.",

Lectures on topics drawn from physics, engineering, and computer science are combined with hands-on group projects.  Lecture topics include kinematics, torque, motors, gear ratios, sensors, and control loop feedback mechanisms. In the hands-on projects, students observe, for example, that their robots are not able to drive in a straight line without sensors. This leads to an exploration of gyroscopes and encoders so as to correct the problem and eventually to a lecture on PID control and a gentle introduction to the concept, from calculus, of integration.  In the final week of the course, the students form into teams and build robots that compete against each other to perform a task taken from a prior robotics competition.",

Can research on the science of learning be used to help us overcome identity-based challenges in STEM disciplines? Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer these and related questions by exploring psychological research on the relationship between identity, cognition, and behavior. We will learn about how concepts such as stereotype threat, performance anxiety, and theories of intelligence impact our decision-making and performance in STEM subjects, as well as review research on how to succeed in difficult academic situations. By the end of this course, students will possess a nuanced understanding of the psychological and motivational factors that can impact STEM achievement and the techniques that can be used to thrive in the face of adversity.",

    "course_descr":"The course fulfills the \u201ccomplex problems\u201d major requirement for the Undergraduate Program in Sustainable Development (UPSD).  The American West is perhaps best known for the dramatic landscapes managed through a web of federal land management agencies. Indeed, western states have a land base that is at least 35% public, and competing interests vie for limited resources and navigate a complex bureaucracy. Less well understood are the dynamics that arise from the interactions among different land ownership categories: federal, state, and private. Working landscapes are essential pieces of the cultural heartbeat of the region. This course will focus on: 1) the history of western settlement, highlighting the ways in which early Westerners divided up the land base and allocated resources; 2) the agencies in charge of managing federal public land including the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Park Service; and 3) state and private land, with a particular interest in the State Land Board. We will explore the legal and regulatory framework that guides land-use decisions, and study enduring resource access conflicts. Pulling from both academic scholarship and the gray literature in political science, environmental sciences, law, and organizational behavior, this course provides an interdisciplinary overview of governance challenges in the American West.  \nAcademic Schedule\n  The course will start on Tuesday, May 31st and meet on Tuesdays\/Wednesdays\/Thursdays on Zoom (likely from 2-5 pm EST each day). The week of June 12th-19th the course will take place in the field in Colorado. The final week will be on Zoom on Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, again likely from 2-5 pm EST each day. The course ends on Thursday, June 23rd.  \nModality\n  The course will be offered in a hybrid format. The first two weeks and final (fourth) week of the class will be held entirely on Zoom. We will meet three times per week (Tues\/Wed\/Thurs) for three hours each session. Week three of the course (June 12-19) will be held in person in Colorado. There, we have the opportunity to visit a broad spectrum of land use types including federally managed forest and grasslands, protected parks, state land board parcels, and private ranches. Student will have some access to local leaders who will accompany us on various field trips to offer their perspectives. The class will participate in many kinds of field activities including hiking in federally designated Wilderness areas, visiting an oi",

    "course_title":"The Networked Self: Identity in the Digi",
    "course_descr":"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.  Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the \u201ccommodified self\u201d and \u201cself-branding.\u201d 2) \u201cDigital surveillance\u201d and the \u201cmanaged self.\u201d 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically \u201cmarginalized\u201d identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",

This interdisciplinary course is an introduction to food and urban cultural studies. It serves as an opportunity to analyze discourses around food, transnational cultures, and urban space, and to apply critical thinking skills to understand the connection between these themes within broader questions. In this course, we will examine the transformation of global cities, culture, food, and capital, and how these are portrayed in different artistic and media productions.  We will employ a multidisciplinary approach to understand and analyze the commodification of food and cultures in connection with urban regeneration to enhance the symbolic economy of different cities. We explore how globalization has had an impact on the urban fabric. We will also emphasize inequality and how neoliberal practices have affected food accessibility and have contributed to gentrification. Additionally, students will examine cities virtually by exploring and comparing their neighborhoods, food stores and markets, gourmet restaurants, galleries and museums, other significant landmarks and cultural venues. The course will also touch on our own relationship to food, what factors do we take into consideration when we consume food? Does food play a key role when we define our identity? Is our heritage and culture relevant when we make food choices? How has our life changed when it comes to food and the way we experience the city after COVID-19? Are residents and our neighbors aware of these rapid changes?  Students explore different cultural and artistic productions to understand how the aforementioned processes are portrayed in visual culture. Topics that will be discussed include commodification of cultures, transnationalism, touristification, gentrification, neoliberalism, media, food and urban cultural studies, and consumer culture in different parts of the world.",

But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct \u2018race\u2019 to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",

In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution.\u00a0Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis.\u00a0  The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.\u00a0 It aims to:  1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.  2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.  3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.  4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.  5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",

An intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. Prerequisite: SPAN UN 2101 or equivalent (as designated by the Department\u2019s Placement Examination). In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. *This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences \u2013including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics\u2014will be given registration priority. All Columbia students must take Spanish language courses (UN 1101-3300) for a letter grade.",

Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.  Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe.  In the process of exploring these challenging topics, course participants expand their capacity for creative problem solving and their ability to think critically and independently.",

Participants learn to apply these concepts by writing code and building models in MATLAB.  In the process of building those models, students learn how to legitimately carry on scientific inquiry. They apply this learning to create their own experimental paradigms in MATLAB. They formulate scientific questions and design hypotheses to test those questions. To test the hypotheses, they create experiments and collect the necessary data by building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with MATLAB. They further analyze data from the experiments using the MATLAB software and form conclusions regarding their scientific inquiry.

The use of the worlds water bodies and the atmosphere as economic inputs to production are also examined. The economics of renewable resources is described and sustainable economic development models are discussed and analyzed. Some time will also be devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn economic concepts, but they will also learn how to explain them to decision-makers. The instructor will tailor this course to the skill level of the students in order to most effectively suit the needs of the class.",

    "course_descr":"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world\u2019s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world\u2019s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2\u00b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.  Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries, \u00a0data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.  This course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",

It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG\/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.  To understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm. The course also provides a practical introduction to selected non-financial accounting topics including sustainability reporting standards, ESG corporate performance indicators and corporate social responsibility report (CSR Reporting).",

The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests.

The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.\u00a0 For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival. The course is going to emphasize the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contribution of deforestation to climate change.",

Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or \u201creality\u201d) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.\n \n While learning about the \u201cTV greats,\u201d students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers\u2019 medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.\n \n The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",

    "course_descr":"Designed for students with a strong interest in law, oral argument, and mock trial, this course immerses participants in the adversarial world of the trial court.  Following an introduction to the United States legal system, students acquire a solid understanding of the trial process, including jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses and experts, introduction of exhibits, closing arguments, and theory building. Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.  Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.  The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.  Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently. At the heart of the program are daily exercises, designed to hone students' trial skills, that are rooted in a hypothetical legal case.  The program culminates in a mock trial session held at the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Manhattan, where students are divided into teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to present their case, prepared over the course of the program, through jury verdict.",

Do the exigencies of counterterrorism require that certain techniques be brought within the bounds of the law? This unit will focus on debates in the United States and more recently in Israel.\n  \u00a0\n  \nSurveillance:\n\u00a0How should counterterrorism policy strike a balance between security and privacy? This unit will focus on recent debates about surveillance programs in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n \n  Course materials draw widely from political science, law, political philosophy, declassified documents, journalism, and film.

Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.  In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.  In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.  Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film.

Students who are curious to explore such issues will find in this course valuable tools for understanding these and other related developments, and for situating them in the larger context of American labor history, the current framework of U.S. labor relations, and global movements for workers\u2019 rights.  Each day of class will feature both a lecture session and a small group activity designed to introduce practical aspects of labor studies, such as how social scientists use data to analyze the economic effects of unions or how labor and management bargaining teams approach the task of negotiating a contract. The course is designed for high school students who may never have taken a class in economics or related disciplines but who are eager to learn more about what labor unions are, how they work, what they do, and what their larger impact is on society and the economy.",

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure.

    "course_title":"WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL",
    "course_descr":"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",

Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

We read and analyze short essays that exemplify good writing, and we learn how to define a thesis, organize an essay, and incorporate appropriate vocabulary.  Participants are required to read a text and provide a synopsis; they also create a research project to outline and write an abstract. The class uses games as a mode to learn more advanced vocabulary. By the end of the week, students will have become not only better writers but also better and clearer thinkers.",

While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.  This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology\u2014the study of animal minds\u2014and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin\u2019s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the \u201cfather of cognitive ethology,\u201d whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.  In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson.

Field excursions to locations such as the Central Park Zoo, the Wild Bird Fund, and the Wolf Conservation Center offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behaviors up close, emulate observation techniques used by scientists in the field, and speak to experts about their research. These first-hand experiences provide context for the material covered in class, and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions.
