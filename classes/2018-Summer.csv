AHMM S3321,MUSICS OF INDIA & WEST ASIA,"This course is a topical (
not
 comprehensive) survey of some of the musical traditions of South and West Asia, and of their diasporas. Each tradition will be described locally, connecting it to critical themes that the course aims to explore. The purpose of the course is to introduce you to a range of indigenous and diasporic “Asian” musical styles, ideas, traditions, and artists through an interdisciplinary approach to the study of music 
as
 culture.

ANTH S3921,ANTI-COLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ 
The Black Jacobins
, Mahatma Gandhi’s 
Hind Swaraj
, Aimé Cesairé’s 
Discourse on Colonialism
, Albert Memmi’s 
Colonizer and Colonized
, and Frantz Fanon’s 
The Wretched of the Earth
—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,9:00am,12:10pm,13444,Morningside,S3921-20182-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/2077,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180627032154/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3921-20182-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

HIST S4779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current 'memory wars' in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa. Partially fulfills Global Core Requirement.",Gregory Mann,1:00pm,4:10pm,19956,Morningside,S4779-20182-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/931,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180627032153/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S4779-20182-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"This past year marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations (UN) and the year when a new Secretary-General will be selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki Moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to -­â€ fewer but deadlier -­armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate -­armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Jeremy O Boutellis,5:00pm,8:10pm,69307,Morningside,S6559-20182-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180704140700/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6559-20182-001,501 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

QMSS GR5073,MACHINE LEARNING SOC SCI,"Prerequisites: basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra, and calculus 
 This course will provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning as it is applied in a number of domains. Comparisons and contrasts will be drawn between this machine learning approach and more traditional regression-based approaches used in the social sciences. Emphasis will also be placed on opportunities to synthesize these two approaches. The course will start with an introduction to Python, the scikit-learn package and GitHub. After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python. Previous programming experience will be helpful but not requisite.

SUMA PS4190,ECON OF SUSTAINABILITY MGMT,"This course builds on core economics courses and addresses issues of environmental, resource and sustainable economics. It focuses on the interaction between markets and the environment; policy issues related to optimal extraction and pricing; property rights in industrial and developing countries and how they affect international trade in goods such as timber, wood pulp, and oil. An important goal of the class is to have students work in groups to apply economic concepts to current public policy issues having to do with urban environmental and earth systems. The use of the world's water bodies and the atmosphere as economic inputs to production are also examined. The economics of renewable resources is described and sustainable economic development models are discussed and analyzed. Some time will also be devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn economic concepts, but they will also learn how to explain them to decision-makers. The instructor will tailor this course to the skill level of the students in order to most effectively suit the needs of the class.",Alexander Heil,6:10pm,8:00pm,26396,Morningside,PS4190-20182-001,ECONOMICS OF SUSTAINABILITY MG,School of Professional Studies,SUMA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180713154853/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/PS4190-20182-001/,414 Pupin Laboratories,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate
