We start with a critical overview of the origins of the discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, and then move on to consider key themes in current archaeological thinking. These include ‘time and the past: what is the difference’? What are archaeological sites and how do we ‘discover’ them? How is the relationship between the living and the dead negotiated through archaeological practice? What are the ethical issues? How do we create narratives from archaeological evidence?

We will assess his role in Dutch politics, religion, and morality; his relations with other artists; the ways his studio functioned; and his own concept of how the market worked and ought to work. Above all we will focus on his art – whether his own changing concept of art, the techniques he used or the place of his work in the visual culture of his time.

Students will be introduced to major artists, works, and media, as well as to key themes in the art historical scholarship. Topics will include: the birth of art criticism; the development of the art market; domesticity and the cult of sensibility; the ascension of women artists and patrons; and the visual culture of empire, slavery, and revolution.

AMST BC3707,GLOBAL RADICALISM,"At the turn of the twentieth century, struggles against racism, capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism encircled the globe. From Irish republicanism in Dublin, Bolshevism in Moscow, revolution in Mexico City, to anti-lynching crusades in Birmingham, as well as all their unanticipated international alliances, these movements represented the largest waves of rebellion hitherto sustained by the global economy. This seminar offers an intensive overview of these various struggles and spaces. Through examination of primary and secondary sources, students will consider radical social movements from distinct yet overlapping cultural and political traditions. We will discuss how participants in these struggles confronted issues of gender, accumulation, and uneven development in their evolving revolutionary theories. Taking a uniquely spatial approach, we will observe how geographies of accumulation emerged alongside sites of global resistance. Throughout the course we will consider the contemporary relevance of these debates, observing how global radicalism might be charted in our present world.",Christina Heatherton,2:10pm,4:00pm,00661,Barnard College,BC3707-20181-001,,American Studies @Barnard,AMST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180116023654/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMST/BC3707-20181-001/,303 Altschul Hall (Barnard),,,4,,W,20181AMST3707X001,SEMINAR

Topics include word, print, image, and sound in relation to Islam, Pentecostalism, Buddhism and animist religions",Brian Larkin,2:10pm,4:00pm,04368,Morningside,GR5114-20181-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/616,,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180613112705/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GR5114-20181-001/,951 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ANTH UN3947,"TEXT, MAGIC, PERFORMANCE","Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 This course pursues interconnections linking text and performance in light of magic, ritual, possession, narration, and related articulations of power. Readings are drawn from classic theoretical writings, colonial fiction, and ethnographic accounts. Domains of inquiry include: spirit possession, trance states, sÃ©ance, witchcraft, ritual performance, and related realms of cinematic projection, musical form, shadow theater, performative objects, and (other) things that move on their own, compellingly. Key theoretical concerns are subjectivity - particularly, the conjuring up and displacement of self in the form of the first-person singular ""I"" - and the haunting power of repetition.

ANTH UN3999,SENIOR THESIS SEM IN ANTHROPOL,"Prerequisites: The instructor's permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. 
 This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original honors thesis in anthropology. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas.,  During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a fully developed, 15-page project proposal, as well as a preliminary draft of one chapter of the senior thesis. The proposal will serve as the guide for completing the thesis during the spring semester. The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis or comparable senior capstone project, and written a draft of one chapter. Readings in the first semester will be geared toward exploring a variety of models of excellent anthropological or ethnographic work.  Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. Weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc).

Students will conduct research at The Map Division of the New York Public Library, meet with environmental and design experts, and visit sites in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Based on this research, students will use digital mapping techniques, 360 video, VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) technologies to create compelling experiential, spatial, analytical, critical, and reflective reconstructions of catastrophic events and remediation.

Furthermore, some ancient RNA molecules combine the roles of both genotype and phenotype into a single molecule. These multi-tasking RNAs offering a possible solution to the paradox of which came first: DNA or proteins. This seminar explores the link between modern RNA, metabolism, and insights into a prebiotic RNA world that existed some 3.8 billion years ago. Topics include the origin of life, replication, and the origin of the genetic code; conventional, new, and bizarre forms of RNA processing; and structure, function and evolution of key RNA molecules, including the ribosome.

 This course covers selected topics in genetics and developmental biology, with special emphasis on issues that are relevant to contemporary society. Lectures and readings will cover the basic principles of genetics, how genes are expressed and regulated, the role of genes in normal development, and how alterations in genes lead to abnormal development and disease. We will also examine how genes can be manipulated in the laboratory, and look at the contributions of these manipulations to basic science and medicine, as well as some practical applications of these technologies. Interspersed student-run workshops will allow students to research and discuss the ethical and societal impacts of specific topics (e.g. 
in vitro
 fertilization, uses and misuses of genetic information, genetically modified organisms, steroid use, and cloning).

 Bacteria are not just unicellular germs. This lab course will broaden your awareness of the amazing world of microbiology and the diverse capabilities of microbes. The focus will be on bacterial multicellularity, pigment production, and intercellular signaling. Pigment-producing bacteria will be isolated from the wild (i.e. Morningside Campus or your skin), and characterized using standard genetic tools (PCR, DNA gel electrophoresis, transformation, screen) and microbiology techniques (isolation of bacteria and growth of bacterial colonies, media preparation, enrichment techniques for pigments). These techniques will also be applied in the study of bacterial multicellularity and signaling in the standard lab strain 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

BIOL 3700
 will provide an opportunity for students interested in independent research work in a hospital or hospice setting. In these settings, where patients and their needs are paramount, and where IRB rules and basic medical ethics make “wet-lab biology research” inappropriate, undergraduates may well find a way nevertheless, to assist and participate in ongoing clinical research. Such students, once they have identified a mentor willing to provide support, participation, and advising, may apply to the faculty member in charge of the course for 2-4 points/semester in 
BIOL W3700
. This course will closely follow procedures already in place for 
BIOL 3500
, but will ask potential mentors to provide evidence that students will gain hands-on experience in a clinical setting, while participating in a hospital- or hospice-based research agenda.

BIOL UN3799,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CANCER,"Prerequisites: three terms of biology (genetics and cell biology recommended). 
 Cancer is one of the most dreaded common diseases. Yet it is also one of the great intellectual challenges in biology today. How does a cell become cancerous? What are the agents that cause this to occur? How do current findings about genes, cells, and organisms ranging from yeast cells to humans inform us about cancer? How do findings about cancer teach us new biological concepts? Over the past few years there have been great inroads into answering these questions which have led to new ways to diagnose and treat cancer. This course will discuss cancer from the point of view of basic biological research. We will cover topics in genetics, molecular and cell biology that are relevant to understanding the differences between normal and cancer cells. These will include tumor viruses, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulation, programmed cell death and cell senescence. We will also study some current physiological concepts related to cancer including angiogenesis, tumor immunology, cancer stem cells, metastasis and new approaches to treatment that are built on recent discoveries in cancer biology. The text book for this course is ""The Biology of Cancer Second Edition by Robert A Weinberg (Garland Science). Additional and complementary readings will be assigned. SCE and TC students may register for this course, but they must first obtain the written permission of the instructor, by filling out a paper Registration Adjustment Form (Add/Drop form).

Topics in Biology: Radiographic Anatomy and Select Pathology (Section 007 Fall semester)
 , Radiographic Anatomy and Selective Pathology is a survey course intended for undergraduate students.  This course is not limited to science majors and would be of value to any student that may have an interest in studying the anatomy of the human body. , The course is a systematic approach to the study of the human body utilizing medical imaging.  We will be studying neuro-anatomy, anatomy of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.  Vascular and musculoskeletal imaging will be addressed as well.  Modalities will include CT, MRI, PET/CT, and Ultrasound.  Cross sectional imaging will be supplemented with pathology demonstrated on appropriate cross sectional imaging. , The class size will be limited to 15 students.  The lecture will be offered Wednesday evenings from 6:10-7:00 pm.  This will be a 1 credit course offered only during the fall semesters. , 
Topics in Biology: Crossroads in Bioethics (Section 001 Spring semester)
 , This two credit multidisciplinary and interactive course will focus on contemporary issues in bioethics and medical ethics. Each topic will cover both the underlying science of new biotechnologies and the subsequent bioethical issues that emerge from these technologies. Each topic will introduce a bioethical principle that will be explored using case studies. Students are expected to prepare for each class based on the assignment so that classroom time will be devoted to discussion, case presentations, and role playing rather than merely lectures. Topics include stem cell research, human reproductive cloning, bioterrorism, neuroethics, genetic screening, medical stem cell tourism, patents and science, forensic science and the interface of science and culture/religion.",John Loike,1:10pm,2:25pm,13581,Morningside,UN3995-20181-001,CROSSROADS IN BIOETHICS,Biological Sciences,BIOL,http://culpa.info/professors/1561,silver,8.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loike,https://web.archive.org///web/20171130100442/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOL/UN3995-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

CGTH UN3402,YOUTH-INTERCONNECTED WRLD,"What does it mean to be 20 years old in our rapidly changing, interconnected world?  There are more youth (aged 15-25) in the world today than at any other time in history, with the majority living in the developing world.  They approach adulthood as the world confronts seismic shifts in the geopolitical order, in the nature and future of work, and in the ways we connect with each other, express identity, engage politically, and create communities of meaning.    What unique challenges and opportunities confront young people after decades of neoliberal globalization?  What issues are most pressing in developing nations experiencing a “youth bulge” and how do they compare to developed nations with rapidly aging populations?  How do young people envision their futures and the future of the world they are inheriting? This course will examine recent scholarship while engaging the young people in the class to define the agenda and questions of the course, and to conduct their own research. 
 “Global 20” complements a new research project of the Committee on Global Thought, “Youth in a Changing World,” which investigates from the perspective of diverse participants and of young people themselves, the most pressing issues confronting young people in the changing world today.   The course will serve as an undergraduate “lab” for the project, and among other involvements, students in the course will help conceive, plan, and take part in a NYC-wide “Youth Think-In” sponsored by the CGT during the Spring 2018 semester.   Within the course, students will become “regional experts” and examine the primary themes of the class through the prism of specific areas or nations of their choosing.  A final class project includes a “design session” that will consider how universities might better train and empower youth to confront the challenges and embrace the opportunities of our interconnected world of the 21

CHEM GU4102,CHEMISTRY FOR THE BRAIN,"Prerequisites: organic chemistry and biology courses, neuroscience or neurobiology recommended, but not required. 
 The study of the brain is one of the most exciting frontiers in science and medicine today.  Although neuroscience is by nature a multi-disciplinary effort, chemistry has played many critical roles in the development of modern neuroscience, neuropharmacology, and brain imaging.  Chemistry, and the chemical probes it generates, such as molecular modulators, therapeutics, imaging agents, sensors, or actuators, will continue to impact neuroscience on both preclinical and clinical levels.  In this course, two major themes will be discussed.  In the first one, titled ""Imaging brain function with chemical tools,"" we will discuss molecular designs and functional parameters of widely used fluorescent sensors in neuroscience (calcium, voltage, and neurotransmitter sensors), their impact on neuroscience, pros and cons of genetically encoded sensors versus chemical probes, and translatability of these approaches to the human brain.  In the second major theme, titled ""Perturbation of the brain function with chemical tools,"" we will examine psychoactive substances, the basics of medicinal chemistry, brain receptor activation mechanisms and coupled signaling pathways, and their effects on circuit and brain function.  We will also discuss recent approaches, failures and successes in the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.  Recent advances in precise brain function perturbation by light (optogenetics and photopharmacology) will also be introduced. In the context of both themes we will discuss the current and future possibilities for the design of novel materials, drawing on the wide molecular structural space (small molecules, proteins, polymers, nanomaterials), aimed at monitoring, modulating, and repairing human brain function.  This course is intended for students (undergraduate and graduate) from the science, engineering and medical departments.",Dalibor Sames,10:10am,11:25am,27193,Morningside,GU4102-20181-001,,Chemistry,CHEM,http://culpa.info/professors/296,,22.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171012200240/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CHEM/GU4102-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

He is a figure of multiples: myriad labors, multiple wives, multiple fathers, and multiple identities.

We will read Hercules in different ancient genres, with a particular emphasis on Tragedy, Comedy, and Philosophy.

CLPS GU4201,BASIC CONCEPTS-POST-FREUD THGT,"This course examines psychoanalytic movements that are viewed either as post-Freudian in theory or as emerging after Freud's time. The course begins by considering the ways Freud's cultural and historical surround, as well as the wartime diaspora of the European psychoanalytic community, shaped Freudian and post-Freudian thought. It then focuses on significant schools and theories of psychoanalysis that were developed from the mid 20th century to the present. Through readings of key texts and selected case studies, it explores theorists' challenges to classical thought and technique, and their reconfigurations, modernizations, and total rejections of central Freudian ideas.

CPLS BC3510,ADVANCED WORKSHOP TRANSLATION,"Prerequisites: CPLT BC 3110 - Introduction to Translation Studies is a recommended prerequisite. 
 A deep immersion in the theory and practice of translation with a focus on translating into English. The first half of the course is devoted to discussing readings in the history of translation theory while translating brief practical exercises; in the second half, translation projects are submitted to the class for critical discussion. The foreign texts for these projects, chosen in consultation with the instructor, will be humanistic, not only literature as conventionally defined (prose fiction and poetry, memoir and travel writing), but also the gamut of text types in the human sciences, including philosophy, history, and ethnography. The aim is not just to translate, but to think deeply about translating, to develop writing practices by drawing on the resources of theory, past and present, and by examining translations written by professionals.  In the spring of 2016, the workshop will be offered in two sections by Professor Peter Connor and Professor Emily Sun. The sections will share most of the common readings in the history of translation theory, but Professor Sun's section will emphasize issues specific to translating East Asia. Enrollment in each workshop is limited to 12 students. Admission into the class is by permission of the instructor. CPLT BC 3011 ""Introduction to Translation Studies"" is a recommended prerequisite, plus, normally, two advanced courses beyond the language requirement in the language from which you intend to translate. Preference will be given to seniors and to comparative literature majors.  Please Email

CPLS GR5660,THE DECOLONIAL TURN AND WEST ASIAS,"The end of the Second World War also marked the end of European dominion over most of the world and the rise of the US and the USSR as new global powers. In 1955, leaders of the newly independent Afro-Asian states met in Bandung, Indonesia, in a watershed conference that marked the beginning of a new epoch of Afro-Asian solidarity, decolonization and common anti-colonial struggles. Seven Arab states took part in this watershed conference, and Egypt would later play host to the Afro-Asian People‚Äôs Solidarity Organization. This course will introduce students to the legacy of this era as seen from the vantage point of the Arab World and West Asia more broadly. It will consider the ways in which this era has influenced first postcolonial and later decolonial scholarship, and engage some of the works to emerge from the Arab anti-colonial era of the 20th century available in English translation. In the first half of the course, students will consider the main distinctions between postcolonial and decolonial theory, decolonization and decoloniality, and engage with different conceptualizations of colonial modernity. Students will also critically evaluate this theory through works that foreground political economy and the intellectual history the Ottoman Empire, the forerunner to European Empire in the region. In the second half of the course, students will consider the Bandung moment and the centrality of Egypt to the Afro-Asian anti-colonial imaginary, and engage some of Arab and Iranian anti-colonial thinkers and themes in relation to the legacies of the decolonization movements and the resultant knowledges and decolonial pedagogies of the formerly colonized world.",Anaheed Al-Hardan,10:10am,12:00pm,93597,Morningside,GR5660-20181-001,DECOLONIAL TURN AND WEST ASIA,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180627032146/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR5660-20181-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

CSER UN3942,RACE AND RACISMS,"In this class we will approach race and racism from a variety of disciplinary and intellectual perspectives, including:  critical race theory/philosophy, anthropology, history and history of science and medicine. We will focus on the development and deployment of the race concept since the mid-19
th
 century. Students will come to understand the many ways in which race has been conceptualized, substantiated, classified, managed and observed in the (social) sciences, medicine, and public health. We will also explore the practices and effects of race (and race-making) in familiar and less familiar social and political worlds. In addition to the course's intellectual content, students will gain critical practice in the seminar format -- that is, a collegial, discussion-driven exchange of ideas.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,12198,Morningside,UN3942-20181-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229005900/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CSER/UN3942-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

. 
 The world is being transformed by dramatic increases in flows of people, goods and services across nations. Globalization has the potential for enormous gains but is also associated to serious risks. The gains are related to international commerce where the industrial countries dominate, while the risks involve the global environment, poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs that affect in great measure the developing nations. Both are linked to a historical division of the world into the North and the South-the industrial and the developing nations. Key to future evolution are (1) the creation of new markets that trade privately produced public goods, such as knowledge and greenhouse gas emissions, as in the Kyoto Protocol; (2) the updating of the Breton Woods Institutions, including the creation of a Knowledge Bank and an International Bank for Environmental Settlements.",Graciela Chichilnisky,5:40pm,6:55pm,26844,Morningside,GU4750-20181-001,,Economics,ECON,http://culpa.info/professors/2657,,7.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graciela_Chichilnisky,https://web.archive.org///web/20171116141325/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/GU4750-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

 This course has two main objectives: 
	
To introduce students to the process of writing a research paper. This includes identifying and formulating a research question, reviewing the previous literature and positioning the problem in that context, identifying the proper tools and data to answer the question, and finally writing the findings in the format of a research paper. An immediate goal is to prepare the students to undertake a senior thesis project.
	
To provide an introduction to selected topics and survey evidence in macroeconomics, with a focus on the expectation formation process of economic agents. We will start by going through some canonical models that are widely used for economic and policy analysis to understand the role of expectations in the decision making of households and firms. We will then go through a series of survey data and relate the empirical evidence to the theoretical predictions of those canonical models.",Hassan Afrouzi Khosroshahi,10:10am,12:00pm,21346,Morningside,UN3952-20181-001,MACROECONOMICS&FORMATION; OF EX,Economics,ECON,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171116203845/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/UN3952-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

This course is based in Laikipia, but may travel to other sites across Kenya, which might include other conservancies and pastoral group ranches. 
This course is part of a semester abroad program in Tropical Biology and Sustainability based in Kenya and cannot be taken separately on campus.",Dustin Rubenstein,,,22382,STUDY ABROAD,OC3924-20181-001,,Global Programs,EEEB,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180605162118/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EEEB/OC3924-20181-001/,,,"Barnard

 Terrestrial paleoecology is the study of vegetation and animals in ancient ecosystems. The paleoecology of eastern Africa is significant because it can shed light on the potential role that climate played in human evolution.  This course aims to teach students the principles of paleoecology primarily through fieldwork, lab work, and research projects. In the first half of the course, students will be introduced to basic methods in the modern Mpala ecosystem. In the second, they will explore the rich record of human evolution in the Turkana Basin.  Students will study bones, teeth, plants, or soils to reconstruct modern and ancient ecosystems.",Kevin Uno,,,15504,KENYA,OC3928-20181-001,,"Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology",EEEB,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180605162122/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EEEB/OC3928-20181-001/,,,"Barnard

 The dynamics of environment and society interact with climate and can be modified through use of modern climate information. To arrive at the best use of climate information, there is a need to see climate in a balanced way, among the myriad of factors at play. Equally, there is a need to appreciate the range of climate information available and to grasp its underlying basis and the reasons for varying levels of certainty. Many decisions in society are at more local scales, and regional climate information considered at appropriate scales and in appropriate forms (e.g., transformed into vegetation stress) is key. Students will build a sufficient understanding of the science behind the information, and analyze examples of how the information can and is being used.

A rigorous analysis of the assumptions underlying the use of climate proxies and their interpretations will be presented. Particular emphasis will be placed on amplifiers of climate change during the alternating ice ages and interglacial intervals of the last few million years, such as natural variations in atmospheric ""greenhouse gases"" and changes in deep water formation rates, as well as mechanisms of rapid climate change during the late Pleistocene. The influence of changes in the Earth's radiation distribution and boundary conditions on the global ocean circulation, Asian monsoon system and El Nino/Southern Oscillation frequency and intensity, as well as interactions among these systems will be examined using proxy data and models.

EESC GU4929,OCEAN MIXING & DISPERSION,"Prerequisites: Recommended preparation: some background in fluids, as provided by courses like EESC GU4925 or APPH E4200, or the instructor's permission. 
 Mixing and dispersion in the ocean is of fundamental importance in many oceanographic problems, including climate modeling, paleo and present-day circulation studies, pollutant dispersion, biogeography, etc. The main goal of this course is to provide in-depth understanding (rather than mathematical derivations) of the causes and consequences of mixing in the ocean, and of the properties of dispersion. After introducing the concepts of diffusion and turbulence, instruments and techniques for quantifying mixing and dispersion in the ocean are reviewed and compared. Next, the instabilities and processes giving rise to turbulence in the ocean are discussed. The course concludes with a series of lectures on mixing and dispersion in specific oceanographic settings, including boundary layers, shallow seas, continental shelves, sea straits, seamounts, and mid-ocean ridge flanks.",Andreas Thurnherr,11:40am,12:55pm,18578,Morningside,GU4929-20181-001,,Earth and Environmental Sciences,EESC,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171118231355/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/GU4929-20181-001/,555 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

 Our objective in this class is to write new poems each week, and find ways to illuminate and articulate our processes as we go along.  Among the questions we’ll explore:  How do imagination, “real life,” and conscious artifice (among other things) enter into the writing of poems?  How does a poem interface with its reader/listener?  What’s the role of enigma, or even opacity, in poetry?  How much clarity or accessibility is desirable? We’ll read poets representing a range of styles and esthetics, with a slight emphasis on contemporary American work. Regular attendance, full participation in class discussions, keeping an “observations” journal (and sharing writing from it each week), and the submission of a final portfolio of poems written in response to prompts and readings are requirements for earning credit in this class.",Regan Good,2:10pm,4:00pm,04251,Barnard College,BC3110-20181-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171112214854/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3110-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

 What makes a play alive? Often a playwright is surprised into their strongest work. The practices of experimentation and analysis, curiosity and audacity lead to new possibilities. Students will read and respond to plays, identifying elements and strategies, and each week bring in fragments and scenes written in response to weekly prompts. By the middle of the semester, students will choose the piece that feels the most viable and develop it into what in most cases will be a thirty page play.

 In the Enlightenment colloquium we will look at English and European imaginative and intellectual life during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

This seminar investigates how American theatre/performance, as read through the lens of gender and sexuality, operates as a cultural force.  Simply put, the U.S. is obsessed with sex; theatre/performance has proven a fertile medium for America’s expression of this obsession. Exploring texts from the seventeenth through the twenty-first centuries, we will consider how performance intersects with the nation state’s desire to regulate how we “practice” gender both publicly and behind closed doors. How is performance, which always includes gendered/raced/classed/sexualized bodies, situated in relationship to ideas of a national body politic?  How does the American nation state hinge on how gender and sexuality are performed both on-stage and off?  Authors include John Winthrop, Dion Boucicualt, Lillian Hellman, Tennessee Williams, David Henry Hwang, Michel Foucault, Jose Muñoz, Jill Dolan, Suzan-Lori Parks, Holly Hughes, Tony Kushner, Lisa Kron, Margaret Cho and performance groups Split Britches, Five Lesbian Brothers, Pomo Afro Homos.",Pamela Cobrin,11:00am,12:50pm,07624,Barnard College,BC3916-20181-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/2177,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171112215903/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3916-20181-001/,To be announced,,Barnard,4,BC3998,R,20181ENGL3916X001,SEMINAR

By the end of this course, you should have a basic grasp of the goals and structure of University Writing, the principles that inform its design, and the kinds of materials used in the course. While the course has an immediate goal—to prepare you for your fall teaching assignment—it aims simultaneously to enrich your teaching in the broadest sense. Your fall University Writing syllabus, as well as your lesson plans and homework assignments for the first eight classes, are due for review on August 1, 2016. This course will give you opportunity to prepare these materials throughout this semester with the support of the UWP directors, senior instructors, and advising lecturers. This course is the first of your ongoing professional development obligations as a UW instructor. You must successfully complete G6913 to teach in the UWP. Every subsequent semester, you will be required to attend a staff orientation, attend at least one workshop, and meet with your mentor and advising UWP director. , All instructors new to the UWP must take this 1-credit, ungraded course during the fall of their first year of teaching. The course is intended to guide instructors through their first semester and emphasizes the practical application of the knowledge and expertise developed in G6913.

We will think closely about the genres that (we think) privilege sexuality β eclogues, plays (especially those performed by boy players), erotic verse, verse letters, utopia and creation stories.",Julie Crawford,2:10pm,4:00pm,90948,Morningside,GU4104-20181-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/461,silver,20.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180625152003/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4104-20181-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL GU4601,EARLY CARIBBEAN LITERATURE,"This course is an introductory survey of early Caribbean Literature. Focusing primarily on the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Anglophone Caribbean, we will ask what the region signified for writers across the Atlantic world and how it shaped natural and political spaces in that world. Given that the Caribbean was a rapidly shifting zone of economic, linguistic, racial, and class interests, we will consider the various ways that we might narrate a literary history of the regionâ€” either distinct from or conjoined with familiar histories of England and the United States. While working toward this goal, we will be conscious of the national, generic, and temporal frameworks that have traditionally shaped literature departments, and ask how our texts resist or reaffirm those frameworks. How and to what degree, we will ask, does the Caribbean disrupt our modes of literary analysis?",Cristobal J Silva,10:10am,11:25am,16396,Morningside,GU4601-20181-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/10802,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180625152227/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4601-20181-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL GU4790,ADVANCED OLD ENGLISH,"Prerequisites: Students must have previous knowledge of Old English -- minimum one semester. 
 The aim of this course is twofold: one, to provide an advanced-level course in Old English literature involving weekly translation; and two, to explore the shape and possibilities of what “Anglo-Saxon spirituality” might be. The primary texts we will be translating will consist in homilies, poetry, treatises, sermons, hymns, prayers, penitentials, letters, and so called “secular” poetry like riddles. We will aim at covering selected materials from the four main manuscripts of Anglo-Saxon poetry (Vercelli, Junius, Nowell, and Exeter) to examine the extent to which they celebrate or veil theological interests. Part our time will involve assessing the prevalent distinction between secular and religious cultures, the relation between materiality and the spiritual, the role of affect in cultivating belief and piety, and the relation between Christian and non-Christian cultures and beliefs. Secondary theological materials will be read in translation including Paschasius Radbertus, Ratramnus, Hincmar, Alcuin, Aldhelm, Jerome, Gregory, and Augustine. Selections of Old Norse mythology and runic texts will also be included. The class will explore the of the role of the church in Anglo-Saxon England, debates about the impact of the Benedictine Reform, and the relation between art and theology.",Patricia Dailey,12:10pm,2:00pm,92399,Morningside,GU4790-20181-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/2218,silver,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180625154358/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4790-20181-001/,602 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL GU4858,MULTIMEDIA BLAKE,"A close study of the historic and material conditions, readerly effects, and subsequent influence of William Blake's illuminated books. This course examines the interplay of poetry and illustration in these remarkable works, paying close attention to Blake's idiosyncratic method of self-publishing. Approaching Blake's plates through digital technology, we will be particularly attuned to the ways they seem to welcome and resist new forms of representation and engagement. Illuminated works we will study in depth include The Book of Thel, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America a Prophecy, Songs of Innocence and of Experience, Europe a Prophecy, The First Book of Urizen, and extracts from Milton a Poem and Jerusalem. We will trace allusions that these works make to the Bible, Dante, Milton, and eighteen-century mystics, writers, and artists; we will also consider later evocations of Blake by poets, filmmakers, musicians, and online communities. To facilitate close reading and collaboration, this seminar will make use of Mediathread, a multimedia analysis platform developed at Columbia by the Center for Teaching and Learning.",Mark L Phillipson,4:10pm,5:25pm,78282,Morningside,GU4858-20181-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/4986,,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171112221328/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4858-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

 This course is intended to introduce students to the advanced study of literature. Students will read works from different genres (poetry, drama, and prose fiction), drawn from the medieval period to the present day, learning the different interpretative techniques required by each. The course also introduces students to a variety of critical schools and approaches, with the aim both of familiarizing them with these methodologies in the work of other critics and of encouraging them to make use of different methods in their own critical writing.

ENGL UN3948,19TH CENTURY THRILLERS,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar).
 
This seminar will investigate the ways in which the nineteenth-century novel is shaped by the forces of horror, sensation, suspense and the supernatural. We will ask how the melodramatic imagination, the rhetoric of monstrosity and the procedures of detection mark high narrative realism with the signs of cultural anxieties building up around nineteenth-century revolution, industrialization, capitalism, Catholicism, bigamy and immigration. Looking at representative samples of the Romantic neo-gothic novel, mid-century ghost stories, the highly popular and controversial sensation novels of the 1860s, aestheticism, and fin-de siÃ¨cle psychological thrillers, we will come away with a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the intersection between the novel and popular entertainment. Readings will include Austen's 
Northanger Abbey
, BrontÃ«'s 
Villette
, Braddon's 
Lady Audeley's Secret
, Collins's 
The Woman in White
, Dickens's

 (Seminar). In Jack London's 1906 short story ""The Apostate,"" an exposÃ© of child labor, the narrator notes of a young millworker: ""There had never been a time when he had not been in intimate relationship with machines."" Drawing on novels, short stories, dramas, and essays by American and English writers from 1880 to WWII, this course seeks to understand what it means to become ""intimate with machines."" How did technology shape perception, consciousness, identity, and the understanding of the human in fin de siÃ¨cle literature? What were the effects of new ""writing machines,"" like the telegraph, phonograph, and typewriter, on traditional conceptions of authorship? How did technology intersect with class, race, and gender politics? What fears and fantasies did new inventions inspire? We will discuss how writers represented the cultural and social impact of technology and why they often felt compelled to invent new literary styles, forms, and movements--such as realism, aestheticism, and modernism--in order to do so. Texts by Herman Melville, Bram Stoker, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Jack London, Sophie Treadwell, Thomas Alva Edison, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and others.

FILM GR6940,DOCUMENTARY ACTIVISM:THEORY,"This is a course in how to think about documentary but not about “how to” make documentary work.  Its premise is that documentary as an approach is still undergoing revision as a definitional problem.  Relevant to our times, cameras and sound recorders are called upon to “witness” events.  Basic readings on the history and theory of documentary are the heart of the course and practical exercises test theoretical questions. Students conduct low end exercises with their own smart phone cameras. Topics and issues center on the history of the radical documentary
—from the Workers Film and Photo League of the 1930s to the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, comparing then new 16 and 35mm film camera capabilities with contemporary internet distribution.  Other topics include climate change and documentary work; motion picture film and photography in labor struggles; uses of anti-war and nuclear bomb footage; sexualities and video camera activism.",Jane Gaines,10:10am,12:00pm,60823,Morningside,GR6940-20181-001,,Film,FILM,http://culpa.info/professors/4740,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171111233046/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/GR6940-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Graduate School of Arts and Science

FILM UN2190,TOPICS IN AMERICAN CINEMA,"Once associated with images of fishnet-costumed fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the concept of the “cult film” has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years. This course seeks to assess the popularization of the phenomenon, asking: what exactly is a cult film? And what does the mainstreaming of the concept suggest about our changing relation to today’s media environment?,  Whereas most types of film can be defined through widely recognized elements of story and setting (tumbleweed, deserts, gunfights: it’s a western), this is far from being the case with cult. Some have defined the cult film as “created” by audiences (again, Rocky Horror); others in terms of nonclassical or aberrant modes of textuality (e.g., various forms of “bad taste” cinema). This course, however, seeks to go beyond audience- and text-based definitions, instead placing cult within a series of historical contexts:,  as an outgrowth of film industry practices that sustained the low cultural status of certain movie types during the classical Hollywood cinema (e.g., B movies, exploitation, etc.);,as the product of audience reception practices, shaped by the politics of cultural taste and “camp” viewing practices that first coalesced during the “midnight movie” phenomenon of the late 1960s/1970s;,as sustained by the transnational flow of media content, offering new frameworks for understanding “national” cinemas.,  In offering such an approach, this course seeks to isolate the different uses to which “cult” has been put, in order to indicate how pervasive and adaptable the idea has recently become.

FREN GU4418,ELOQUENT ANIMALS IN MEDIEVAL LITERATURE,"Medieval literature, like contemporary literature, sometimes features talking animals. But medieval grammatical treatises describe non-human animal utterances as meaningless and (usually) as untranscribable in writing. Some human utterances also fall into this category—a fact that grammatical treatises acknowledge—, rendering language alone an inadequate means of shoring up the species boundary. When authors liken their own language to that of a non-human animal, such as the myriad medieval poets who profess to “sing like the birds,” is this a serious claim, leading to experimental poetics? When non-human animals “speak” in medieval fiction, do they speak differently from their human counterparts? This seminar surveys texts in which animals communicate—via language or via other symbolic systems. How, if at all, did medieval authors attempt to draw the line between human and non-human animals? Our reading will include lyric poetry by the troubadours and 
trouvères,
 Chrétien de Troyes’ 
Yvain,
 
Philomena
, selected fables (both anonymous and by Marie de France), the 
Novas del papagai 
(
The Story of the Parrot
), the 
Roman de Renart, 
and Gaston Phébus's 
Le livre de chasse. 
Alongside these texts, we will read theoretical reflections on language and sound, both medieval and modern, including medieval catalogs of animal “noises” and grammatical treatises on voice. Contemporary reflections by Derrida, Jean-Christophe Bailly, Mladen Dolar and others. Reading knowledge of modern French highly recommended.",Eliza Zingesser,4:10pm,6:00pm,20848,Morningside,GU4418-20181-001,ELOQUENT ANIMALS IN MEDIEVAL L,French and Romance Philology,FREN,http://culpa.info/professors/13181,,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171228174538/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/GU4418-20181-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

FREN GU4418,ELOQUENT ANIMALS IN MEDIEVAL LITERATURE,"Medieval literature, like contemporary literature, sometimes features talking animals. But medieval grammatical treatises describe non-human animal utterances as meaningless and (usually) as untranscribable in writing. Some human utterances also fall into this category—a fact that grammatical treatises acknowledge—, rendering language alone an inadequate means of shoring up the species boundary. When authors liken their own language to that of a non-human animal, such as the myriad medieval poets who profess to “sing like the birds,” is this a serious claim, leading to experimental poetics? When non-human animals “speak” in medieval fiction, do they speak differently from their human counterparts? This seminar surveys texts in which animals communicate—via language or via other symbolic systems. How, if at all, did medieval authors attempt to draw the line between human and non-human animals? Our reading will include lyric poetry by the troubadours and 
trouvères,
 Chrétien de Troyes’ 
Yvain,
 
Philomena
, selected fables (both anonymous and by Marie de France), the 
Novas del papagai 
(
The Story of the Parrot
), the 
Roman de Renart, 
and Gaston Phébus's 
Le livre de chasse. 
Alongside these texts, we will read theoretical reflections on language and sound, both medieval and modern, including medieval catalogs of animal “noises” and grammatical treatises on voice. Contemporary reflections by Derrida, Jean-Christophe Bailly, Mladen Dolar and others. Reading knowledge of modern French highly recommended.",Eliza Zingesser,4:10pm,6:00pm,20848,Morningside,GU4418-20181-001,ELOQUENT ANIMALS IN MEDIEVAL L,French and Romance Philology,FREN,http://culpa.info/professors/13181,,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180625154403/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/GU4418-20181-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

The goal of this mini-course is to encourage students to take advantage of the many intellectual opportunities throughout the University, to gain exposure to a variety of approaches to history, and at the same time assist them in focusing on a particular area for their thesis topic.",Line Lillevik,,,10789,Morningside,GR5994-20181-001,,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003827/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR5994-20181-001/,,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,1-3,,,20181HIST5994G001,SEMINAR

HIST GR8207,NEW DIRECTIONS IN RUSSIAN HIST,"The field of Imperial Russian history has undergone profound transformations since the August Revolution of 1991. Curiously, the basic outlines of our understanding of Soviet history have remained fundamentally unchanged despite the explosion of new archival materials over the past twenty years. In contrast, interpretations of the pre-revolutionary period have changed dramatically. New chronologies, new thematic approaches, new topics, and new transnational juxtapositions all characterize the historiography of the last two decades. One particularly important element is attention to geographical space and location. In this colloquium, we will examine some of the most influential recent research in the field, using particular books as a jumping-off point to delve deeper into topics such as empire and frontier, environment, religion, monarchy, Russian-Ottoman encounters, and the transmission of ideas.",Catherine Evtuhov,12:10pm,2:00pm,16037,Morningside,GR8207-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/13430,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229004043/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8207-20181-001/,309 Hamilton Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

After four to five class sessions dedicated to clarifying related concepts (power and soft power, norms, hegemony, empire, propaganda, strategic communication, public diplomacy and the relationship between domestic and foreign policy and the capacity to act as a global model) subsequent classes address case studies including Napoleon's Propaganda Wars, imperial European Civilizing Missions, The US vs. USSR, Wilson versus Lenin, The Axis Powers in the Muslim World, Vatican Diplomacy, The Marshall Plan, U.S. Public Diplomacy in the wake of 9/11, The European Union's Norms Empire",Victoria de Grazia,6:10pm,8:00pm,67374,Morningside,GR8323-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/93,,15.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229004048/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8323-20181-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

From the 1950s to the 1990s historians agreed that the New Deal order marked the latest phase in an American political reform tradition that reached back to Progressivism and Populism, even as they disagreed about its social origins and intensity. In this reading, the triumph of modern conservatism in the 1970s and 1980s represented a backlashâ€”a fundamentally new force in American politics. More recently, some scholars have challenged this view by arguing that the New Deal order was an exception to a much longer conservative political tradition. In this reading, the rise of conservatism after 1968 marked a return to national type. We will explore these historiographical turning points by reading major works that deal with the social and cultural origins of modern liberalism, the creation of the New Deal, and the roots of modern conservatism. The purpose of this exploration is to provide essential historiographical training for students undertaking research in the modern period and to reinforce substantive historical knowledge for students who will teach classes that cover the modern period.

Readings will include examples of the most significant areas of research on the region, with an emphasis on the diversity if approaches that characterize the historiography of post-independent Latin America in the past two decades, from social and political history to studies of culture, economic development, and international relations. Topics will include the causes and significance of the independence, histories of “nation-building,” the origins of economic backwardness, peasant societies and social movements, twentieth century populism, authoritarianism and social change,  and transnational histories of culture and the Cold War.

HIST GR8771,NEOLIBERAL AFRICA,This course is designed as a seminar on a historiography that does not yet exist. It asks what a history of contemporary or ‘neo-liberal’ Africa would look like. The ambition of the seminar is to consider how historians might engage with and profit from the work of anthropologists working on the frontier between African states and the institutions of global civil society. It does so by decentering the state from the macro-narrative of the continent’s recent history. It also strives to situate the African present in relation to broader historical currents at work across the globe in the contemporary period.,Gregory Mann,4:10pm,6:00pm,76600,Morningside,GR8771-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/931,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229004058/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8771-20181-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

HIST GR8924,RESISTANCE & THE BLK ATLANTIC,"This course investigates in-depth the significance of resistance among African-descended communities in the Anglophone, Francophone, Hispanophone and Lusophone Atlantic World from approximately 1700-1950. We will examine the genesis of resistance as it affected key historical transformations such as slavery and abolition, labor and migration, and transatlantic political organizing. The class will explore various forms of resistance to racial epistemologies, racialized labor regimes, and gendered discourses that formed a continuum of cultural and political opposition to oppression among Black Atlantic communities. The course will also reflect on how resistance plays a central role in the formation of individual and collective identities among black historical actors. Resistance will be explored as a critical category of historical analysis, and a central aspect in the making of the “Black Atlantic.”

HIST GU4083,CRIME/PUNISHMENT/MIDDLE AGES,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 How a society defines crime, and how it deals with the criminals tells us a lot about the moral values, and the political and economic structure of that society, as well as its internal conflicts, superstitions, and fears. Often supposed to be a barbaric community of ignorant unruly men governed by greedy kings and popes, the medieval society in the popular culture is often an inspiration to the grotesque representations of violence and torture. Even an intellectual like Michel Foucault did not hesitate to advance a theory of medieval punishment, albeit a terribly wrong one, as one that focuses on the body and spectacle.  This course is designed to trace the origins of the modern criminal legislation and practices to the Middle Ages, some of which were jury trial, public persecution, and prisons. How did these practices come about, and under which social conditions? The focus of the course will be on violent crimes, such as murder, robbery, assault and suicide, and some particularly medieval crimes like sorcery, blasphemy and sodomy. The geographical scope will be limited to England, Italy and France. The class discussions are expected to take the form of collective brainstorming on how the political powers, social classes, cultural values, and religious beliefs affect the development of criminal legislation and institutions. Whenever possible the weekly readings will feature a fair share of medieval texts, including trial records, criminal laws, a manual for trying witches, and prison poetry.

HIST GU4110,FRENCH AMERICA 1534-1804,"A study of the French Atlantic World from the exploration of Canada to the Louisiana Purchase and Haitian Independence, with a focus on the relationship between war and trade, forms of intercultural negotiation, the economics of slavery, and the changing meaning of race. The demise of the First French Colonial Empire occurred in two stages: the British victory at the end of the Seven Years War in 1763, and the proclamation of Haitian Independence by insurgent slaves in 1804. The first French presence in the New World was the exploration of the Gulf of St. Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534. At its peak the French Atlantic Empire included one-third of the North American continent, as well as the richest and most productive sugar and coffee plantations in the world. By following the history of French colonization in North America and the Caribbean, this class aims to provide students with a different perspective on the history of the Western hemisphere, and on US history itself. At the heart of the subject is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans and between Europeans and Africans. We will focus the discussion on a few issues: the strengths and weaknesses of French imperial control as compared with the Spanish and the British; the social, political, military, and religious dimensions of relations with Native Americans; the extraordinary prosperity and fragility of the plantation system; evolving notions of race and citizenship; and how the French Atlantic Empire shaped the history of the emerging United States.

Instead, in this class Grossman’s novel will serve as a gateway to learn about and discuss a set of issues which have in common that they were of great importance in the history of the former Soviet Union as well as Europe and the world.

It is geared both at History majors, particularly but not exclusively those specializing in European Intellectual History, and at students interested in the literature and culture of Germany, France, and Great Britain. We will also  take a  brief look at Romantic writers in Eastern Europe. We will read primarily works written by philosophers and social thinkers, but also a good deal of literature, both prose and poetry. We will have two sessions devoted to the plastic arts – including a class trip to the Metropolitan Museum to view paintings and sculptures, and we will have one session devoted to Romantic music (a study of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.)  We will include readings relating to the Romantic fascination with “the East,” and devote one session to the crucial subject of Romanticism and gender.  Most of the readings will be primary sources either originally in or translated into English, as well as a selection of pertinent secondary sources.",Michael F Stanislawski,2:10pm,4:00pm,71992,Morningside,GU4311-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/102,,66.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stanislawski,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003812/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GU4311-20181-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

It seems to me to be the greatest single shift in the consciousness of the West that has occurred, and all the other shifts which have occurred in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries appear to me in comparison less important, and at any rate deeply influenced by it.” (Isaiah Berlin, The Roots of Romanticism) , This seminar will introduce students to the manifold expressions of Romanticism in Europe from the late eighteenth century to the late nineteenth century. It is geared both at History majors, particularly but not exclusively those specializing in European Intellectual History, and at students interested in the literature and culture of Germany, France, and Great Britain. We will also  take a  brief look at Romantic writers in Eastern Europe. We will read primarily works written by philosophers and social thinkers, but also a good deal of literature, both prose and poetry. We will have two sessions devoted to the plastic arts – including a class trip to the Metropolitan Museum to view paintings and sculptures, and we will have one session devoted to Romantic music (a study of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.)  We will include readings relating to the Romantic fascination with “the East,” and devote one session to the crucial subject of Romanticism and gender.  Most of the readings will be primary sources either originally in or translated into English, as well as a selection of pertinent secondary sources.",Michael F Stanislawski,2:10pm,4:00pm,71992,Morningside,GU4311-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/102,,66.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stanislawski,https://web.archive.org///web/20180217230646/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GU4311-20181-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST GU4811,HIST ENV. & HEALTH S. ASIA & BEYOND,"This course offers an understanding of the interdisciplinary field of environmental, health and population history and will discuss historical and policy debates with a cross cutting, comparative relevance: such as the making and subjugation of colonized peoples and natural and disease landscapes under British colonial rule; modernizing states and their interest in development and knowledge and technology building, the movement and migration of populations, and changing place of public health and healing in south Asia. The key aim of the course will be to introduce students to reading and analyzing a range of historical scholarship, and interdisciplinary research on environment, health, medicine and populations in South Asia and to introduce them to an exploration of primary sources for research; and also to probe the challenges posed by archives and sources in these fields. Some of the overarching questions that shape this course are as follows: How have environmental pasts and medical histories been interpreted, debated and what is their contemporary resonance? What have been the encounters (political, intellectual, legal, social and cultural) between the environment, its changing landscapes and state? How have citizens, indigenous communities, and vernacular healers mediated and shaped these encounters and inserted their claims for sustainability, subsistence or survival? How have these changing landscapes shaped norms about bodies, care and beliefs? The course focuses on South Asia but also urges students to think and make linkages beyond regional geographies in examining interconnected ideas and practices in histories of the environment, medicine and health. Topics will therefore include (and students are invited to add to these perspectives and suggest additional discussion themes): colonial and globalized circuits of medical knowledge, with comparative case studies from Africa and East Asia; and the travel and translation of environmental ideas and of medical practices through growing global networks.",Kavita Sivaramakrishnan,2:10pm,4:00pm,76375,Morningside,GU4811-20181-001,HIST ENV. & HEALTH S.

HIST UN2305,WAR IN GERMANY 1618-2018,"For much of modern history Germany was Europe‚Äôs battlefield. Its soldiers wrote themselves into the annals of military history. But it was also a place where war was discussed, conceptualized and criticized with unparalleled vigor. Nowhere did the extreme violence of the seventeenth century and the early twentieth century leave a deeper mark than on Germany. Today, as we enter the twenty-first century, Germany is the nation that has perhaps come closest to drawing a final, concluding line under its military history. This course will chart the rise and fall of modern militarism in Germany. For those interested in military history per se, this course will not hold back from discussing battles, soldiers and weapons. But it will also offer an introduction to German history more generally. And through the German example we will address questions in political philosophy that haunted modern European history and continue to haunt America today. How is state violence justified?

HIST UN2501,THE EARLY AMERICAN REPUBLIC,"The American Revolution is often imagined as a rebellion against a mighty empire that gave rise to a self-governing republic. But during the first decades of American independence, some of the new republic’s political leaders set about building an empire of their own. This introductory-level course lays out a narrative of the early American republic in which one Anglo-American empire was broken and another arose to take its place. The course also asks: at what cost came this new American empire, and what alternatives—practical, radical, or utopian—were passed over in the course of its creation?",Hannah Farber,10:10am,11:25am,60280,Morningside,UN2501-20181-001,,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003611/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN2501-20181-001/,603 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

HIST UN3109,THE BODY IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions.  
 The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Heidi L Hausse,12:10pm,2:00pm,86147,Morningside,UN3109-20181-001,THE BODY IN EARLY MOD EUR,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003713/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3109-20181-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST UN3225,ASIATIC RUS:EMPIRE & STATE,"The aim of this course is to provide students with a fresh perspective on the concept of Eurasia originating in imperial Russian intellectual history. The course sets out to highlight the impact of nomadic political cultures on shaping the operation of Russian imperial policies and practices and their legacies, a perspective that is typically not represented in Eurasian and Russian history courses as a major idea of analysis. The course’s focus therefore will be on the spread of Russian rule over Eurasia’s steppe regions and Turkestan. Among other things, the course explores how the interplay of the nomadic concepts of sovereignty and territoriality enabled the rise of the Russian empire. Beyond ethnic and cultural history special attention will be devoted to economic and military history, as well as political institutions and diplomacy. We will also look at the ways in which the concept of Eurasia continued to inspire Soviet and post-Soviet politicians and other related groups to construct and reconstruct boundaries between East and West.",Gulnar T Kendirbai,12:10pm,2:00pm,61887,Morningside,UN3225-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/2974,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003716/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3225-20181-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST UN3679,MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES,"In Trump’s presidential campaign, perhaps no country loomed as large as Mexico. Trump singled out the United States’ southern neighbor and its people in his speeches, promising to build a wall along the border, to deport millions of Mexicans, and to end the North American Free Trade Agreement. He described Mexicans in racist terms, and he proclaimed his love of the taco bowl to counter charges of discrimination. Today, there is more uncertainty about the future of Mexico-U.S. relations than at any other time in living memory. 
 It is critical to understand this bilateral relationship not only because it is in flux, but also because these two countries are so deeply connected. Mexican migration to the United States is the most massive flow of immigrants in modern history. No country has more consulates in another country than Mexico has in the United States. Trade between these countries is crucial for both economies. The people of these two nations constantly share and adapt each other’s cuisine, music, language, and holidays. But despite proximity and interconnection, tension and violence are also near-constant features of interactions between the two countries. How has this peculiarly close, unequal, and ambivalent relationship between Mexico and the United States in the past two hundred years? By the end of this course, you will be able to offer some answers to this thorny question. 
 The course is divided into 4 units, spanning from nineteenth century to the present day, although the bulk of the course focuses on the twentieth century. We will cover periods of great tension between the countries, such as the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), but we will also examine moments when friendlier relations prevailed. We will look at Mexican migration over the past 150 years. We will also note the intensity of cultural exchanges between the countries, particularly during the twentieth century, that have spanned from fine arts to fast food. Finally, we will talk about the economic ties that have long linked Mexico and the United States, including the 1994 signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement.",Rachel G Newman,2:10pm,4:00pm,63780,Morningside,UN3679-20181-001,MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATEW,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003746/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3679-20181-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST UN3928,SLAVERY/ABOLITION-ATLANTC WRLD,"Prerequisites: seminar application required. SEE UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR SECTION OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. 
 This seminar investigates the experiences of slavery and freedom among African-descended people living and laboring in the various parts of the Atlantic World. The course will trace critical aspects of these two major, interconnected historical phenomena with an eye to how specific cases either manifested or troubled broader trends across various slaveholding societies. The first half of the course addresses the history of slavery and the second half pertains to experiences in emancipation. However, since the abolition of slavery occurs at different moments in various areas of the Atlantic World, the course will adhere to a thematic rather than a chronological structure, in its examination of the multiple avenues to freedom available in various regions. Weekly units will approach major themes relevant to both slavery and emancipation, such as racial epistemologies among slaveowners/employers, labor regimes in slave and free societies, cultural innovations among slave and freed communities, gendered discourses and sexual relations within slave and free communities, and slaves’ and freepeople’s resistance to domination. The goal of this course is to broaden students’ comprehension of the history of slavery and freedom, and to promote an understanding of the transition from slavery to freedom in the Americas as creating both continuities and ruptures in the structure and practices of the various societies concerned.",Natasha J Lightfoot,2:10pm,4:00pm,77031,Morningside,UN3928-20181-001,,History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/3419,silver,5.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003801/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/UN3928-20181-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HSEA GR6861,BRONZES PART II EAST ZHOU INSCRIPTIONS,"Prerequisites: Students must have good knowledge of Classical Chinese; reading ability in modern Japanese is also preferred, but not required. 
 The ancient Chinese bronzes, many being recently excavated, are the most splendid cultural treasures of Bronze-Age China (
ca
 2000-500 B.C.), as the inscriptions they carry are critical sources of early Chinese political institution, religion, literature, as well as economic relations. This course teaches the essentials of bronze scholarship, such as the methods of authentication, dating, and deciphering and reading the bronze inscriptions. The aim of the course is to provide students with a necessary training in using bronze objects and the inscriptions in their future research in Chinese civilization. Needless to say, a good understanding of the transition of the design and decorative patterns of the bronzes is the essential underlying knowledge of the course. In this regard, the course will teach ways to contextualize such changes through links to their inscriptions and the relevant archaeological contexts.",Feng Li,1:50pm,4:10pm,17149,Morningside,GR6861-20181-001,BRONZES PART II EAST ZHOU,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,http://culpa.info/professors/1088,silver,12.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Feng_%28sinologist%29,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003832/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/GR6861-20181-001/,422 Kent Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

HSEA GU4232,EMPIRES FORMATION MODERN E.A.,"This course, a seminar for advanced undergraduates and M.A. students, explores themes in the history of empires in East Asia, from the early 18th century to the end of World War II. The main geographical focus will the region now corresponding to mainland China (including a part of Inner Asia), Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Colonial empires and their possessions in Southeast Asia will also be discussed. The master narrative of modern political history has long been one of transition from Empire to Nation: decaying empires – Mughal, Ottoman, Qing – proved unable to adapt to the challenges of modern international competition, and were replaced more or less violently with more homogeneous nation-states. We have come to see, however, that empires are more flexible and durable political forms than previously thought, and also that East Asian polities were far from stagnant when Western imperialism burst onto the scene. Imperialism itself was not foreign to the region; the Qing Empire, for example, vastly expanded its territory in the 18th century. Both in Japan and in China, although in different ways, modern nation-building was inseparable from the imperial control of remote and heterogeneous lands. Lastly, in the East Asian context of the 19th and early 20th centuries, framing Western powers as aggressive “nations” is partial at best: what East Asians dealt with were colonial empires, whose policies were often determined at the margins rather than in the metropole. It is therefore appropriate to consider the international history of East Asia from the 18th century to World War II through the lens of interactions and conflict among Empires and Empires in the making.",Victor Louzon,4:10pm,6:00pm,20484,Morningside,GU4232-20181-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003811/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/GU4232-20181-001/,522C Kent Hall,,"Barnard

HSPB UN2950,SOCIAL HIST OF AMER PUB HEALTH,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with an historical understanding of the role public health has played in American history. The underlying assumptions are that disease, and the ways we define disease, are simultaneously reflections of social and cultural values, as well as important factors in shaping those values. Also, it is maintained that the environments that we build determine the ways we live and die. The dread infectious and acute diseases in the nineteenth century, the chronic, degenerative conditions of the twentieth and the new, vaguely understood conditions rooted in a changing chemical and human-made environment are emblematic of the societies we created. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How does the health status of Americans reflect and shape our history? How do ideas about health reflect broader attitudes and values in American history and culture? How does the American experience with pain, disability, and disease affect our actions and lives? What are the responsibilities of the state and of the individual in preserving health? How have American institutions--from hospitals to unions to insurance companies--been shaped by changing longevity, experience with disability and death?",James K Colgrove,8:40am,9:55am,25739,Morningside,UN2950-20181-001,,History,HSPB,http://localhost:8801/professors/6321,gold,9.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003707/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSPB/UN2950-20181-001/,417 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

It will provide students with a deeper understanding of the often complex technological, political, and national security issues that arise from the intersection of global energy issues and national security. They will learn how policy is formed around these issues in the US and other countries, including domestic political and geopolitical considerations. The course will begin with an overview of the dramatic paradigm shifts currently taking place in the global energy industry. We will then analyze and discuss the geopolitical and national security implications associated with these transformations. During the next two classes, students will take a deeper dive into two specific areas: threats to energy infrastructure and nuclear security. The nuclear security session will feature a case study of the MOX plutonium disposition project, which will provide students with a candid look at the competing political, economic, foreign policy and national security objectives that one often finds in a highly complex, multibillion dollar project. In the last section of the course, students will prepare for and actively participate in a mock White House Situation Room decision meeting with respect to an energy-related national security crisis, which will be provided to them in advance.

INAF U6242,ENERGY POLICY,"The course provides a survey and analysis of the various dimensions, domestic and international, of policy formulation that, taken together, constitute energy policy. These dimensions include contributing to access to and production of natural energy resources; insuring the security and reliability of energy sources; promoting the diversity of fuels and development of new  technologies in light of energy security and climate change mitigation objectives; promoting energy conservation and energy efficiency; environmental regulation at the domestic (air and water quality) and global (climate) levels. The objectives inspiring these policies are pursued through a combination of reliance on energy markets; subsidies and tax policy; development of energy infrastructure and a broad array of international policies influencing relations among and between net exporting and net importing countries. The origin of each policy issue, and lessons from significant ""market failures,"" are examined and the consequences of policy alternatives are evaluated.  The major legal and regulatory themes of U.S. energy policy are examined (Part 1) and so are the essential dimensions of international policies affecting the international energy scene.",Jason E Bordoff,9:00am,10:50am,17896,Morningside,U6242-20181-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bordoff,https://web.archive.org///web/20171223040819/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/U6242-20181-001,801 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,M,20181INAF6242U001,LECTURE
INAF U6265,ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY ISRAELI-ARAB CONFL,"This course looks at the environmental connections of the century long Israeli-Arab conflict. Focusing on the core element of the conflict - the territorial contest over historic Palestine – it also looks at environmentally pertinent events and processes along and across Israel's frontiers with its other Arab neighbors Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Relatively small in size, historic Palestine was defined in the 20th century by two opposing demographic transformations: the arrival of millions of diasporic Jews driven by a desire to 'return' to a historic homeland from which, they believe, their ancestors had been banished 2000 years ago; and the forced departure in early 1948 of 750,000 Palestinians refugees. Fleeing a war which ended with a sovereign  Israel and the demise, for many decades, of hopes for their own self determination, Palestinian refugees, their descendants and Palestinians generally harbor a powerful persuasion of their own of an imminent return. This two pronged demographic upheaval coincided with a relentless drive  for modernization and rapid economic growth, first in Israel, later in Palestinian nation-building  and state-building efforts. Interlocked in a dual of nationalizing territorial projects, the two communities developed important public institutions which, while inherently committed to development and growth, are equally preoccupied with an external nemesis. It is a struggle in which Israel has so far had the upper hand, with consequences also for its relations with its other Arab neighbors.",Dan Rabinowitz,11:00am,12:50pm,88596,Morningside,U6265-20181-001,ENVIRO HIST ISRAELI-ARAB CONFL,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171222162303/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/U6265-20181-001,402 International Affairs Building,,"Architecture

For students interested in a career in M&E, this course will help them recognize and address some of the common challenges they will face at work (e.g. how to convince and collaborate with the chief of party to invest in and run effective M&E). For students who are interested in non-M&E career tracks, this course will help them do their jobs better and help the development and humanitarian fields overcome “pilot-itis” and become more evidence-driven.

To address this question, the course will focus on three areas (1) the core factors that shape Russia’s  security perspective, including geography, demography, natural resources, and historical-cultural factors—as well as Russia’s military capabilities; (2) Russia’s foreign/security policies in each region of the world  and how those policies align with Moscow’s stated national security goals, as enunciated in official documents and policy statements; and (3) a comparative review of the last six cases of military intervention to assess which security factors predominated in Moscow’s decisions to intervene in Afghanistan (1979), Chechnya (1994, 1999), Georgia (2008), Ukraine (2014) and Syria (2015).",Peter Clement,2:10pm,4:00pm,93596,Morningside,U8488-20181-001,CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN SECURITY,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171223000243/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/U8488-20181-001,1302 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,R,20181INAF8488U001,SEMINAR

ITAL GU4019,"ITALIAN/HIST, ITALIAN STORIES","Prerequisites: The class will be in Italian. The knowledge of Italian is required. However, students who understand Italian but prefer to discuss the texts in English are very welcome.  
 Between 1960 and 1980 Leonardo Sciascia and Italian micro-historians reflected extensively on the relation between history and fiction. How did they relate with nineteenth century Italian historical fiction? How did they use fiction and non-fiction as hermeneutical tools to understand the Italian past, and especially pre-modern Italy? How did Carlo Ginzburg and Leonardo Sciascia read Manzoni? And what did Sciascia find in Natalie Zemon Davis’ books? Are microhistory and global history compatible? What is history from ‘below’? Is it compatible with the history of the ‘in-between’? We will probe these questions of large import for both literary historians and historians through an examination of Alessandro Manzoni’s 
Storia della Colonna Infame
, Italian historical non-fictions, such as Leonardo Sciascia’s 
inchieste
, Nuto Revelli’s 
Il disperso di Marburg 
and Wu Ming’s

The first course will focus primarily on methodological and theoretical problems in the fields broadly described as historical social sciences - which study historical trends, and political, economic and social institutions and processes. The course will start with discussions regarding the origins of the modern social sciences and the disputes about the nature of social science knowledge. In the next section it will focus on definitions and debates about the concept of modernity. It will go on to analyses of some fundamental concepts used in modern social and historical analyses: concepts of social action, political concepts like state, power, hegemony, democracy, nationalism; economic concepts like the economy, labor, market, capitalism, and related concepts of secularity/secularism, representation, and identity. The teaching will be primarily through close reading of set texts, followed by a discussion.

MDES GU4637,CINEMA&COLONIALISM; IN SOUTH ASIA,"What is the relation between cinema and colonialism? This seminar approaches cinema as a dynamic historical agent that aided, negotiated, refracted, and contested the mechanisms and meanings of colonialism in South Asia. We will study cinema as technology, as industry, and as cultural form, paying attention to questions of film finance, on-screen representation, production infrastructures, circuits of distribution, and sites of exhibition. We will watch films made by British ethnographers, Indian expats, Hollywood orientalists, and South Asian nationalists to
study how film served as a key weapon of imperial propaganda as well as anticolonial resistance. From orientalist films that constructed the colony as exotic and dangerous, to the spatial uses of Indian films to reinforce race inequalities in the diaspora (eg. East Africa), cinema is deeply imbricated with colonial strategies of racial, gendered, and caste-based othering.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory.  The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global.  European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged.  Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other.  This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.”  
 The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.”  The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold.  The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative.  Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them.  
 The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified.  Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts.  The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,11:40am,12:55pm,25849,Morningside,UN1001-20181-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERS,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,http://culpa.info/professors/21,,30.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Dabashi,https://web.archive.org///web/20171228020622/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/UN1001-20181-001/,310 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

MUSI GU4375,MUSIC AND MADNESS,"Prerequisites: None. 
 This undergraduate seminar offers historical and critical perspectives on music as a cause, symptom, and treatment of madness. We will begin by analyzing the stakes of studying the history of music and madness in light of methodologies from history, ethnography, and disability studies. We will then apply these frameworks to an investigation of selected topics in the histories of music and madness, as well as more recent ethnographies of the role of music in conjunction with altered mental states. In doing so, we will examine the interplay of embodied experience with respect to composed and improvised music as well as the soundscapes of religious rituals and trance states. The course is intended to foster interdisciplinary engagement between students interested in music, history, and medicine, and to provide them with critical tools to examine constructions of music and madness in social, scientific, and historical contexts.

MUSI GU4470,MUSIC & BOLLYWOOD,"In what ways does the visual and musical archive of Hindi film--commonly referred to as “Bollywood”--reflect and constitute social life in South Asia and beyond? This course takes this broad question as its starting point as we consider relationships between the popular cinema of Bombay (Mumbai) and South Asian history, culture, and politics. A study of Hindi film music will serve as a foundation for discussions on the nature of popular culture and how we can fruitfully study it in an academic context, as we consider debates regarding popular culture’s role in society. Is popular culture only reflective of commercial interests? Or does it play an instrumental function in driving political and social change? A further focus of this course will be to consider various methods of analyzing musical media. We will study approaches that music and film scholars use to analyze music’s role in cinematic narratives, and use these discussions to make our own critique of how music is used in Hindi cinema production.",Eben Graves,2:10pm,4:00pm,69691,Morningside,GU4470-20181-001,,Music,MUSI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171224185357/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MUSI/GU4470-20181-001/,701A Dodge Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

MUSI GU4630,RECORDED SOUND,"Prerequisites: The instructor's permission. 
 As music moves into the 21
st
 century, we find ourselves surrounded by an ever-evolving landscape of technological capability. The world of music, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that change comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility.  What does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer?   With big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer artists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and distribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and production work on their own.   But where does one go to learn how to do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production, but the historical underpinnings and the development of the music production industry as well?  How does one develop a comprehensive framework within which they can place their own artistic efforts?  How does one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like and develop their own style? 
 This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be the answer.  It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music from across history and genres in order to identify the production techniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern technology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical works.",Mario Diaz de Leon,1:10pm,4:00pm,27096,Morningside,GU4630-20181-001,,Music,MUSI,http://culpa.info/professors/9394,silver,5.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171224190836/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MUSI/GU4630-20181-001/,317 Prentis Hall at 632 W 125th St,,"Barnard

A number of critical questions we will consider include: how does a particular gender ideology constructs and is constructed by musical aesthetics? What are some of the critical roles for women in performance?  What is the significance of gender in performances? What does it mean for women to have have and to be the voice?

Are both equally valuable? What is the relationship between public opinion and a healthy democracy? How does capitalism and the mass medial affect the public sphere?

POLS BC3025,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES,"Political parties have evoked widespread scorn in the U.S. since the founding era; and yet, they arose almost immediately and have endured for over two centuries. In this course, we will examine why parties formed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major party.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties are, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over time as organizations, in the electorate, and in government. 
 Topics will include the presidential nomination process from the founding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season, the life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political parties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward. 
 Throughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How much is too much?

Admission by application
 through the Barnard department only. Enrollment limited to 16 students. 
 Harlem in Theory is an advanced political theory colloquium.  Its focus is both thematic and methodological.  Joining a two-thousand year tradition of doing philosophy in and for the city, we theorize Harlem as urbs and civitas (place and socio-political association) and bring Harlem to bear on philosophy.  We explore the political theorist's craft by engaging different theoretical approaches and methodologies used by political, social and critical theorists.  Our readings include political philosophy, critical frameworks for interpretation and historical, social scientific and literary works about Harlem - supplemented by film, music and of course periodic trips to various Harlem venues.

POLS BC3801,COLL:POLITICS OF DEVELOPMENT,"Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent 
 Description: The semester-long course aims to study political and social factors behind economic development and exam empirical cases of the success and failure in economic growth in order to understand the key features of the development processes. In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3. Understand some country specific political economy processes and how these processes prove or disprove certain theories and policies.",Xiaobo Lu,4:10pm,6:00pm,04651,Barnard College,BC3801-20181-001,COLL:POLITCS OF DEVELOPMENT,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/3989,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180122163047/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/BC3801-20181-001,404 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

The field survey is designed for political science graduate students who intend to specialize in American politics, as well as for those students whose primary interests are comparative politics, international relations, or political theory, but who desire an intensive introduction to the ""American"" style of political science. In this course we will cover a range of topics related to American politics that, for the most part, are not covered in G6210. The reading assignments are a mix of foundational contributions (i.e., the canons of American politics literature) and recent research. The first part of each seminar session will aim to clarify and probe enduring puzzles, theories, and debates highlighted in the foundational texts.

The main activities of special interest groups include lobbying, campaign contributions, direct mobilization of citizens, and providing information to the public. Clearly all of them have political significance, and we will study both theoretically and empirically the most significant channels of influence on policies, sometimes through the influence on elected officials (before or after the election) and sometimes through influence on bureaucrats.

 The central question around which this course is organized is: Under what circumstances, and how, do international legal rules influence political outcomes? International law has been for decades dismissed by IR scholars as utopian, disconnected from political reality, or (at best) epiphenomenal to the interests and preferences of powerful states. Consequently, it has been viewed as the 'wrong' place to look when seeking to explain the past actions of states and governments, or to predict their future behavior. Nevertheless, states—including great powers—have invested, and continue to invest, enormous resources, in elaborating and maintaining international treaties and conventions, customary rules, and other types of international legal doctrine. This suggests that international law 'matters' somehow to relations between states—although perhaps not in ways we conventionally associate with domestic legal systems.",Tonya L Putnam,2:10pm,4:00pm,13968,Morningside,GR8843-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://localhost:8801/professors/3203,,29.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105212431/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GR8843-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

POLS GU4405,INSURGENCIES/CONFLICTS-SE ASIA,"A number of countries in Southeast Asia have recently faced violent conflicts, often linked to separatist or regionalist demands from territorially concentrated ethnic or religious minorities. This course examines a range of conflicts in Southern Thailand (Patani), Southern Philippines (Mindanao), Indonesia (notably Aceh) and Burma, through a variety of different lenses and comparative perspectives. These include security and (counter)insurgency perspectives, the comparative character of militant movements, perspectives based on minority rights and identity politics, explorations of the salience of religion, studies of language politics, questions of autonomy and decentralization, and the issue of peace negotiations and dialogue processes. These themes and issues have a broader relevance to wider debates in comparative politics, which students will be encouraged to explore in their papers.",Duncan McCargo,12:10pm,2:00pm,64361,Morningside,GU4405-20181-001,INSURGENCIES/CONFLICTS SE ASIA,Political Science,POLS,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_McCargo,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105212436/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4405-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS GU4434,ETH POL ACROS POST-SOV EURASIA,"Various forms of ethnic politics have characterized politics in many states throughout Eurasia since 1991, from nationalist separatism to violent conflict to political competition among ethnic minorities and majorities. This course is designed to encourage students to think deeply about the relationship between ethnicity and politics. We will consider several questions. First, why does ethnicity become politicized? We investigate this question by examining nationalist secessionism and ethnic conflict—phenomena that mushroomed at the end of the Cold War. We will focus on East Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, devoting special attention to the cases of Yugoslavia, the USSR, Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Chechnya. However, we will also study cases in which the dog didn’t bark, i.e. places where nationalist mobilization and ethnic violence either did not occur, or emerged and then receded as in the ethnic republics of the Russian Federation (including the “Muslim” regions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, etc.). In the second part of the course, we will analyze ethnic politics after independent statehood was achieved throughout the post-Soviet space. How do nationalist state-builders try to construct a nation and a state at the same time? Have they incorporated or discriminated against minorities living within “their” states? How have ethnic minorities responded? We will study Ukraine, the Baltics and Kazakhstan where ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking populations form large portions of the population, devoting particular attention to the crisis in Ukraine. We will also examine how the post-conflict regions of Bosnia and Kosovo have dealt with ethnic pluralism. These cases allow us to gain greater understanding of how multi-ethnic states use forms of federalism, consociationalism, and power-sharing as state-building strategies.",Elise Giuliano,2:10pm,4:00pm,63169,Morningside,GU4434-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/6706,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105212441/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4434-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS GU4449,CONFLICTS IN ISRAELI POLITICS,"Prerequisites: INSTRUCTOR PERMISSION REQUIRED 
 Conflicts, cleavages and contentiousness are a common feature of a democratic system of government in general. In this respect Israel is no exception. Apart from being the Start Up
Nation and the Holy Land, in the minds of many around the world Israel is associated with 
conflict. Indeed, both internally and externally, Israeli politics is suffused with conflict and 
continuously has to live up to the challenge of preserving democracy in the presence of conflict. 
The achievements of Israel in the political, economic, international and social arenas were 
facilitated by the emergence of a pattern of politics, indeed, a political culture, that puts a strong emphasis on the pursuit of political accommodation among social groupings, political parties and
ideological strands even at the expense of compromising their respective manifest interests,
aspirations and programs. Moreover, the mobilization capabilities of Israel's governments have
been remarkable by any standard. They were capable of inducing the citizens to accept willingly
such burdens as high taxation, harsh economic measures and long conscript and reserve military
service. Israel has done all these without loss of public support for its central political and social
institutions.
This class will focus on conflicts, external and internal. We will examine social, economic and
political cleavages within the state of Israel. We will study the Arab-Israeli conflict and in
particular the interaction of Israel with the Palestinians over the years. Finally, we will examine
broader circles in which Israeli foreign policy applies and in particular in the context of US-Israel

In recent years, a number of important global trends have become evident in the study of justice. These include a growing focus on transitional justice – especially how the transition from an authoritarian regime, or from conditions of violent conflict, may best be handled. Another important trend is the so-called ‘new constitutionalism’ – efforts to strengthen checks and balances through establishing new institutions such as constitutional courts. A third trend concerns disturbing developments in the use of the criminal justice system for essentially political purposes.

Yet headlines seldom tell the whole story. Who is Vladimir Putin and what does the political system he presides over – often called the 
power vertical
 – consist of? What explains the electoral dominance of United Russia? Why are there massive but rare protests in Russia? What role does masculinity play in public politics in Russia? What motivated and what was gained by the annexation of the Crimea? This class will answer these questions and others by examining issues relevant to contemporary Russian politics. Students will begin with an overview of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the painful transition of the 1990s. Students will then examine Russia’s current political regime as well as the political career of Vladimir Putin.

POLS GU4828,RISING POWERS&THE; TRANSFORMATION OF GLOB,"Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world entered a unipolar moment, with the United States remaining the sole superpower. But more recently the global order has undergone transformations, with non-Western powers playing an increasing role. This module examines the “rise of the rest,” most notably China, Russia, Brazil and India, the so-called BRICS. These states account for 40% of the world’s population and 22% of the global economy. As we move toward a post-unipolar world, the norms of global governance, including liberal peacebuilding, intervention and development, are becoming an increasingly contested terrain. Not only have the rising powers challenged some of these notions and deployed their own non-liberal responses to them, but disillusionment with the liberal international order has grown in the West, with the election of Trump and Brexit having further shaken confidence in the durability of the current liberal order. 
 In this module, students will define and explore the concept of “Rising Powers,” and examine the recent history and foreign policy of the BRICS countries. Students will examine their positions on central tenets of the liberal order. In the final sessions, students will debate the consequences of the rise of new powers in the international system. Where some analysts have argued that these rising powers will integrate smoothly into the international system causing minimal disruption, others are alarmed about the shifting dynamics in the international system and the decline in American power, predicting future conflicts.",Edward J Lemon,,,75898,Morningside,GU4828-20181-001,RISING POWERS&THE; TRANSFORMATI,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105212536/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4828-20181-001/,,,"Barnard

POLS GU4845,NAT SECURITY STRAT OF MID EAST,"At the crossroads of three continents, the Middle East is home to many diverse peoples, with ancient and proud cultures, in varying stages of political and socio-economic development, often times in conflict. Now in a state of historic flux, the Arab Spring has transformed the Middle Eastern landscape, with great consequence for the national security strategies of the countries of the region and their foreign relations. The primary source of the world's energy resources, the Middle East remains the locus of the terror-WMD-fundamentalist nexus, which continues to pose a significant threat to both regional and international security. The course surveys the national security challenges facing the region's primary players (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria and Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinians and Turkey, Jordan) and how the revolutions of the past year will affect them. Unlike many Middle East courses, which focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on the regional players' perceptions of the threats and opportunities they face and on the strategies they have adopted to deal with them. It thus provides an essential vantage point for all those interested in gaining a deeper understanding of a region, which stands at the center of many of the foreign policy issues of our era. The course is designed for those with a general interest in the Middle East, especially those interested in national security issues, students of comparative politics and future practitioners, with an interest in ""real world"" international relations and national security.",Charles D Freilich,10:10am,12:00pm,62552,Morningside,GU4845-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://localhost:8801/professors/5874,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171118000849/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4845-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS GU4852,INSURGENCIES AND CIVIL WARS,"Terrorism is a tactic most often employed in the context of broader conflicts and armed struggles. Of these, civil wars have become the predominant type of conflict in recent years and decades, as exemplified by the civil wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, or Yemen, among others. Invariably, these civil wars feature insurgencies, i.e., organized, protracted politico-military struggles designed to weaken control and legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority, while increasing insurgent control. 
 The purpose of this course is to examine the causes, nature, and termination of civil wars and the insurgencies that characterize them. Special emphasis is placed on the conduct of civil warsâ€”the nature of insurgency and counterinsurgency (COIN). The course offers different theoretical perspectives and provides historical and contemporary case studies.",Assaf Moghadam,10:10am,11:25am,68397,Morningside,GU4852-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171118043805/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4852-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS GU4871,CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY,"The course describes the major elements of Chinese foreign policy today, in the context of their development since 1949. We seek to understand the security-based rationale of policy as well as other factors - organizational, cultural, perceptual, and so on - that influence Chinese foreign policy. We analyze decision-making processes that affect Chinese foreign policy, China's relations with various countries and regions, Chinese policy toward key functional issues in international affairs, how the rise of China is affecting global power relations, and how other actors are responding. The course pays attention to the application of international relations theories to the problems we study, and also takes an interest in policy issues facing decision-makers in China as well as those facing decision-makers in other countries who deal with China.",Andrew J Nathan,2:40pm,3:55pm,69757,Morningside,GU4871-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/26,,44.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_J._Nathan,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105211309/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/GU4871-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

The course is organized around four questions. First, why can only some people depend upon the state to enforce order? Second, how can we account for the differences between autocracies and democracies? Third, what different institutional forms does democratic government take? Finally, are some institutions more likely than others to produce desirable social outcomes such as accountability, redistribution, and political stability?",Hande Mutlu-Eren,6:10pm,7:25pm,27000,Morningside,UN1501-20181-001,,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171105212551/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/UN1501-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

POLS UN3176,LIBERALISM:ORIGINS&CHALLENGES;,"Liberalism is a moral and political outlook that stresses the equal worth of individuals and advocates a range of rights protecting individual conscience, speech, association, movement, and property. This course explores the historical origins, moral claims, and contemporary controversies of liberal thought.

PUAF U6226,HISTORY FOR FUTURE POLICYMAKERS,"Leaders often invoke the lessons of history, but rarely talk about anything but a few familiar episodes. Even if we can all agree that we should avoid another attack on Pearl Harbor or war in Vietnam, does this actually help us make decisions about the future? In this course, students will explore both the problems and the opportunities with using historical analysis to grapple with present and future challenges. They will develop a deeper understanding of the most often cited historical episodes, but also learn how to avoid using analogies in the place of more original thinking. That means thinking like a historian, and the course will introduce key concepts that can be used to analyze a range of complex challenges, including continuity and change, contingency and inevitability, human agency and structural constraints. But they will also learn how NOT to think like a historian, such as using history as a weapon, and extrapolating into the future.",Sarah C Kovner,11:00am,12:50pm,77946,Morningside,U6226-20181-001,HIST FOR FUTURE POLICYMAKERS,International and Public Affairs,PUAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171229003829/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PUAF/U6226-20181-001/,501B International Affairs Building,,"Architecture

PUAF U6307,INEQUALITY & AMERICAN POLITICS,"A substantial number of scholarly and popular analyses of rising inequality have appeared in recent years, and the subject has occasioned increasing debate. Yet there are many unresolved questions about the role of American politics and policy in reshaping the U.S. economic distribution, as well about the effects that this changing distribution have had on American political organization, participation, and influence. And, of course, there is currently intense debate about which political and economic reforms might be desirable or possible in the face of these linked transformations of the polity and economy. These are the issues taken up in this course. The purpose of this course is to encourage students to think critically and analytically about the ways in which growing inequalityâ€”particularly the hyper-concentration of income and wealth at the very top of the economic ladderâ€”have intersected with the transformation of American politics over the past generation. In addition to developing a better of understand of why inequality has risen and how this development is related to politics and policy, the course encourages students to think seriously about what can be done to address both inequality itself and the political imbalances associated with it.",Jacob Hacker,4:10pm,6:00pm,92847,Morningside,U6307-20181-001,,International and Public Affairs,PUAF,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Hacker,https://web.archive.org///web/20180128120252/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PUAF/U6307-20181-001,407 International Affairs Building,,"Architecture

PUAF U8228,CITY POLICY & FEDERALIAM IN AGE OF TRUMP,"Federalism in America fundamentally reshaped the geopolitical power balance in the world over the course of less than 150 years. Federalism helped define what it meant to be an American at large and even helped define regional American identities. The role of local government in America is dependent on the size of the constituency and the powers allotted to the city by State constitutions. So why do cities even exist? Even as there is extraordinary optimism about the future of America’s cities, most continue to grapple with the devastating effects of 20th century deindustrialization and racial disparities in education, income, housing, and health. In this course, we will use a three-tiered analysis – Legal, Political, and Fiscal – to explore the roles that each level of government plays in the political processes of modern federalism. We will discuss the difference in city-state relations and differences in city-federal relations based on regions of the United States. We will seek to answer the questions: How do these differences and the evolution of the relationship shape our current policies and America’s path for the future? How does federalism constrict and empower cities in the modern political climate?",Michael A Nutter,11:00am,12:50pm,60896,Morningside,U8228-20181-001,CITY POL & FEDERALISM: TRUMP,International and Public Affairs,PUAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180124152358/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PUAF/U8228-20181-001,801 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,W,20181PUAF8228U001,SEMINAR
PUBH UN3100,FUNDAMENTALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH,"Many of the greatest challenges in public health are global. This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to discuss the major underlying determinants of poor health and the relationship between health and political, social and economic development. Drawing upon the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, students will be introduced to the evolution of modern approaches to the setting of global health priorities, the functions and roles of health systems, an overview of current global health practices, and the major institutional players in global health. The first unit of the class will focus on establishing the foundations for a public health approach to understanding the challenges of global health. This will involve exploration of the factors shaping the global distribution of disease and their connection with issues of social, economic, and political development, as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals. The second unit will explore in further detail a number of major health priorities. A significant goal of the class will be to identify common sources of vulnerability and challenge across health risks, and the consequent need for a systemic approach to their being addressed. The third and final unit builds upon this analysis to demonstrate the multi-disciplinary, multi-level approach required to effectively address global health priorities, and the political and organizational cooperation required to achieve this. The class concludes with an analysis of the major challenges and threats to global coordination regarding such threats as pandemic influenza and emerging health threats related to climate change.

The course discusses the politics, foreign policies, and interrelations of China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Russia with the United States. The principal focus is on US relations with these Northeast Asian nations, as well as their bilateral and multilateral relations. The course examines the rise of nationalism in Northeast Asia, a key and growing driver for regional hostilities, and issues of history and popular memory, the source of recent ferment in relations. Participants examine the political, economic and social developments in the region and challenges that hinder increased regional integration. The class weighs the evolution of the American alliance system following World War II, Japan’s post-war transformation, South Korea’s emergence from the 1970s, North Korea’s developmental challenges and pursuit of nuclear weapons, and China’s rise as a regional and global power. The course posits nineteenth and twentieth century experiences that influence the bent of Northeast Asian foreign policies today.

RELI GR9320,EVAL SOURCES-ISLAMIC STUDIES,"This course focuses on the primarily research skills necessary in the evaluation of classical Arabic sources. Each week students are presented with a set of primary sources and asked to evaluate them in a number of ways including (but not limited to) the identification of (i) important figures, (ii) Qur'Änic and poetic references, (iii) transmission history, (v) authorship, and (iv) historical context. Class discussion draws on the results of student research to highlight those methods central to the field of Islamic studies. Students are also expected to prepare selected texts to be read and translated in class.

Science fiction is often perceived as hostile to religion, yet it often blurs the boundaries between science and religion.

RELI GU4526,FOOD SEX PREMOD CHIN BUDDHISM,"This course is an upper-level seminar on appetite and its management, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Our focus will be on the appetites of food hunger and sexual desire, and how Chinese Buddhist teachings propose to manage these. Food and sex are separate domains of experience, but as the primary objects of bodily appetites, they are analogous. Eating and sex both involve a direct and substantive interaction with the material world that is driven by powerful desires. In Buddhist teachings, these desires are said to bind us to the cycle of rebirth (
saṃs
ā
ra
) and to shape the actions (karma), both mental and corporeal, that constitute our moral engagement with the phenomenal world. Hence it is important to know how a Buddhist on the path out of suffering is to manage these activities. What do monastic codes stipulate? What disciplines did lay Buddhists undertake? How are transgressions identified and handled? How do ancient Chinese and Daoist ideas inform the development of Chinese Buddhist attitudes toward sex and diet? How did Chinese Buddhist monastics come to adopt a meatless diet? How do religions use food and sex as tools for determining one's ritual purity (i.e., moral worth)? We will explore these and related topics. Despite the common perception of Buddhism as a world-denying religion focused on transcending bodily needs, Chinese Buddhists (and their Indian or Central Asian counterparts) engaged in numerous body practices with worldly benefit, while at the same time mitigating the dangers of desire through various doctrinal and practical means. This course is an exploration of those means.",Robban A Toleno,10:10am,12:00pm,61196,Morningside,GU4526-20181-001,,Religion,RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/13358,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180119142900/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/GU4526-20181-001,201 80 Claremont Ave,,"Barnard

Offered over a series of semesters, it is aimed at developing a practice of reading: close or distant, and always attentive. Let us say: slow reading. What does it mean to read? Where and when does reading start? Where does it founder? What does reading this author (Freud, for example) or that author (say, Foucault) do to the practice of reading? Can we read without misreading? Can we read for content or information without missing the essential? Is there such a thing as essential reading? Favoring a demanding and strenuous exposure to the text at hand, this course promises just that: a demanding and strenuous exposure to reading. 
The course can be repeated for credit.",Gil Anidjar,12:10pm,2:00pm,91497,Morningside,GU4626-20181-001,FREUD AND DERRIDA,Religion,RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/392,,21.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180402090031/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/GU4626-20181-001/,201 80 Claremont Ave,,"Barnard

RELI UN3518,BUDDHISM E ASIAN MED CULTURES,"This seminar introduces students to the intersections between Buddhism and medicine in East Asia in the premodern period. The course begins with Buddhist ideas and practices concerning health and disease in ancient India over two millennia ago, and follows the eastward transmission of these concerns and activities into China, Korea, and Japan until roughly the 16
th
 century. In addition to secondary studies representing the latest research in this burgeoning field, this course gives special attention to critical readings of shorter selections of primary sources translated into English, including sutras, monastic regulations, recipe collections, liturgical documents, and longevity manuals. Reading these selections through multiple methodological frameworks—social history, history of the body, and material culture, students will gain an appreciation of the rich diversity that characterized Buddhist healthcare practices before the introduction of Western medicine. A fundamental premise of this course is that different currents of Buddhism constituted medical cultures in their own right, a perspective that will help us to complicate conventional notions of both “religion” and “medicine.” We will aim to achieve a nuanced understanding of the ways that healing concerns shaped how monks and nuns related to actors of other therapeutic communities, and therefore emphasis is placed on the social and cultural contexts in which Buddhist medical practices were embedded.

RUSS GU4044,EURASIAN URBANISM,"Cities encapsulate the social, political, and economic processes of their time and studying them offers a window into the societies that produce them. This course explores the institution of the city across Eurasia from the nineteenth century to the present. Before World War I, rapid urbanization began to significantly alter how the Russian Empire was run, how its economy functioned, and how its various peoples interacted. With the rise of Soviet socialism, the “socialist city” became an object of intense discussions, while experimental architecture, massive public works projects, and the Soviet forced labor economy changed the face of cities across Eurasia. The Cold War ushered in a new era of state-sponsored nuclear research, competition over consumer goods, and a new Soviet role in the so-called Third World. Finally, with the collapse of Soviet socialism, cities were simultaneously nationalized and globalized. 
 The Soviet city is at the core of the course, while its predecessors, imitators, and successors are also considered. In taking this course, students will examine broader processes and trends through focused case studies of cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg/Leningrad, Tashkent, Lviv, and Berlin. Students will learn to think about these cities in a comparative context as well as to tease out what was specific to the experience of socialism. By examining primary sources, scholarly work on urban history, and films, students will become familiar with the urban experience in Eurasia and how it has been portrayed.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,97847,Morningside,GU4044-20181-001,FROM THE IMPERIAL TO POST SOVI,Slavic Languages,RUSS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171118231628/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RUSS/GU4044-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

SDEV GU4050,US WATER & ENERGY POLICY,"Course Summary:
 Water, one of humankind’s first power sources, remains critically important to the task of maintaining a sustainable energy supply, in the United States and elsewhere. Conversely, the need to provide safe drinking water and keep America’s rivers clean cannot be met without access to reliable energy supplies. As the impact of climate disruption and other resource constraints begins to mount, the water/energy nexus is growing increasingly complex and conflict-prone. 
 
Essential Connections 
begins by examining the development of America’s water and energy policies over the past century and how such policies helped to shape present-day environmental law and regulation. Our focus then turns to the current state of US water and energy resources and policy, covering issues such as oil and gas exploration, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power and renewables. We also examine questions of inclusion and equity in connection with the ways in which communities allocate their water and energy resources and burdens along racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. The third and final section of the course addresses the prospects for establishing water and energy policies that can withstand climate disruption, scarcity and, perhaps most importantly, America’s seemingly endless appetite for political dysfunction. 
 By semester’s end, students will better understand the state of America’s energy and water supply systems and current efforts to cope with depletion, climate change and related threats affecting these critical, highly-interdependent systems. As a final project, students will utilize the knowledge gained during the semester to create specific proposals for preserving and enhancing the sustainability of US water and energy resources.",Paul A Gallay,6:10pm,8:00pm,82192,Morningside,GU4050-20181-001,,Earth Institute,SDEV,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171224001328/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SDEV/GU4050-20181-001,407 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

SDEV UN3390,GIS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMNT,"This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of theoretical concepts underlying GIS systems and to give students a strong set of practical skills to use GIS for sustainable development research. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a system of computer software, data and analysis methods used to create, store, manage, digital information that allow us to create maps and dynamic models to analyze the physical and social processes of the world. Through a mixture of lectures, readings, focused discussions, and hands-on exercises, students will acquire an understanding of the variety and structure of spatial data and databases, gain knowledge of the principles behind raster and vector based spatial analysis, and learn basic cartographic principles for producing maps that effectively communicate a message. Student will also learn to use newly emerging web based mapping tools such as Google Earth, Google Maps and similar tools to develop on-line interactive maps and graphics. The use of other geospatial technologies such as the Global Positioning System will also be explored in this class. Case studies examined in class will draw examples from a wide ranges of GIS applications developed to assist in the development, implementation and evaluation of sustainable development projects and programs. On completion of the course, students will: 1. use a variety of GIS software programs to create maps and reports; 2. develop a sound knowledge of methods to search, obtain, and evaluate a wide variety of spatial data resources; 3. develop skills needed to determine best practices for managing spatial data resources; 4. use GIS to analyze the economic, social and environmental processes underlying the concept of building a sustainable world; 5.

SPAN BC3443,CATALAN REGIONALISM/NATNLISM,"Prerequisites: Third-year bridge course (W3300), and introductory surveys (W3349, W3350). 
 In the nineteenth century, the failure of the Spanish State to find political alternatives to centralism, coupled with Catalonia's industrial and economic takeoff, led to the development of a strong regionalist sentiment, and eventually a nationalist movement. From this period and through the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, intellectuals became engaged in the creation of a cultural repertoire to ground and strengthen the claim to a Catalan nationality.

SPAN GR6008,IBERIAN COLLECTIVE MEMORY,"This class is at once an introduction to the material archive and scholarly practices that characterized early modern Iberian antiquarianism and an exploration of how modern political polemics have transformed the meaning of that archive. Our first of two principal goals will be to examine the works of sixteenth-century peninsular antiquarians such as Pedro de Medina and Ambrosio de Morales, who catalogued and studied buildings, monuments, landscapes, neighborhoods, ruins, manuscripts, coins, relics, and myriad other sorts of artifacts. The compilations produced by these scholars did not simply function as inventories of ancient and medieval antiquities, which local, regional, or imperial apologists might then celebrate as a source of pride. They also established these antiquities as “sites of memory,” to borrow a term from the French historian Pierre Nora. By experimenting with different ways to document and interpret the peninsula’s multiconfessional past, early modern antiquarians moreover demarcated the conceptual territory upon which conservative apologists for a Catholic Spain and liberal proponents of religious and cultural pluralism have subsequently clashed. In order to trace this modern debate over the legacy of pre-modern material culture, which is the second main goal of this class, we will balance our early modern sources with interdisciplinary scholarship on collective memory and the anthropology and sociology of religion. Readings include early modern texts and visual materials by Francisco Bermúdez de Pedraza, Rodrigo Caro, Pablo de Céspedes, Pedro Díaz de Ribas, Pedro de Medina, Ambrosio de Morales, and Lucius Marineus Siculus, as well as scholarship by Eric Calderwood, Astrid Eril, Barbara Fuchs, Maurice Halbwachs, Andreas Huyssen, Susan Martín-Márquez, Pierre Nora, and Mikaela Rogozen-Soltar, among others.",Seth R Kimmel,1:00pm,3:00pm,26030,Morningside,GR6008-20181-001,,Spanish and Portuguese,SPAN,http://localhost:8801/professors/12633,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171123000350/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SPAN/GR6008-20181-001/,505 Casa Hispánica,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,W,20181SPAN6008G001,SEMINAR

An intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. Prerequisite: SPAN UN 2101 or equivalent (as designated by the Department’s Placement Examination).
In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health.
*This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World).

 A careful review of the concept of stochastic process as a model of random phenomena evolving through time and of conditional expectation, basic Markov process theory, and the exponential distribution.  Marked point processes and their compensators, beginning with Poisson processes, and proceeding through general marked point processes.  The use of compensators will be justified by the Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem, and as such it will connect the theory to martingales.  Markov processes will enter to provide a description of sufficient conditions for the compensators to have absolutely continuous paths (and as such, have ""hazard rates"").  Applications to survival analysis and, especially, to mathematical finance, including default and bankruptcy models.  Cox process construction.  This is a core course in the MS program in mathematical finance.",David A Rios,2:40pm,3:55pm,62864,Morningside,GU4262-20181-001,,Statistics,STAT,http://culpa.info/professors/13276,,10.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20171114205128/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/GU4262-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

URBS UN3450,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY DVLP,"New York City is made up of more than 400 neighborhoods. The concept of neighborhoods in cities has had many meanings and understandings over time. Equally complex is the concept of community used to describe the people attached to or defined by neighborhood. While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial, social, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community often refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers, investors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their environment. Community development is “a process where these community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems” that result from the changing contexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and approaches, residents organize themselves or work with community development practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable housing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically, develop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing markets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods, community development organizations are taking on new roles and adapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region and nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural diversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in federal policy. 
 For more than a century, city-dwellers—and especially New Yorkers—have been tackling these challenges. This course will examine both historic and contemporary community building and development efforts, paying special attention to approaches which were shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a “city of neighborhoods,” has long been a seedbed for community-based problem-solving inventions. The course will focus on the theories (why?), tools (how?), and actors (who?) within the field of community development practice and is organized around important sectors (housing, economic development, food systems, arts), case studies, and contested concepts (public participation, social capital, public space).",Mary Rocco,11:40am,12:55pm,01220,Barnard College,UN3450-20181-001,,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,http://culpa.info/professors/13554,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180609081316/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBS/UN3450-20181-001/,203 Diana Center,,,3,,MW,20181URBS3450V001,SEMINAR

The course is structured in two parts. The first centers on the fundamental and technical aspects of the material. Students will learn construction techniques, glazing and finishing methods, and particulars about firing procedures. This part of the course will move quickly in order to expose the students to a variety of ceramic processes. Weekly assignments, demonstrations, and lectures will be given. The second centers on the issue of how to integrate ceramics into the students' current practice. Asking the question of why we use ceramics as a material and, further, why we choose the materials we do to make art. Rigorous group and individual critiques focusing on the above questions will be held. The goal of this course is to supply the students with the knowledge and skill necessary to work in ceramics and enough proficiency and understanding of the material to enable them to successfully incorporate it into their practice.

. 
 (Formerly R4005) Students will connect with the very heart of the Western Art tradition, engaging in this critical activity that was the pillar of draftsmanship training from the Renaissance on through the early Modern Era. This pursuit is the common thread that links artists from Michelangelo and Rubens to Van Gogh and Picasso. Rigorous studies will be executed from plaster casts of antique sculptures, and pedagogical engravings. Students will confront foundational issues of academic training; assessing proportion and tonal value, structure and form. Hours will be spent on a single drawing pushing to the highest degree of accuracy in order develop a means for looking at nature. There is a focus on precision and gaining a thorough understanding of the interaction between light and a surface. This approach emphasizes drawing by understanding the subject and the physical world that defines it. While this training has allowed great representational artists of the past to unlock the poetry from the world around them and continues to inspire a surging new realist movement, it can also serve as a new way of seeing and a launching point for achieving creative goals.

(Formerly R3131) This course will focus on using ceramics as a primary art making machine by breaking out of the constraints wedded to this traditional material. Building on the foundation set in 
VIAR R2200 
Ceramics I, this course will delve further into the technical and historical aspects of the ceramic process.,Students will use a self-directed working process to facilitate the incorporation of ceramics materials into their existing art making while allowing them room to go in their own conceptual direction.  Rigorous group and individual critiques will be held on a regular basis.  Content is a priority in this class, and with the further understanding of ceramic processes and materials, the goal is for the student to be fluid in producing their ideas without the obstruction of technical difficulties.  In addition to the rigorous making of objects from start to finish our technical progression will be broken down into three parts:,Part one:,Testing and understanding of ceramic materials. Students will formulate their own glazes and clay bodies from raw ceramic materials.

VIAR R2200 
Ceramics I, this course will delve further into the technical and historical aspects of the ceramic process.,Students will use a self-directed working process to facilitate the incorporation of ceramics materials into their existing art making while allowing them room to go in their own conceptual direction.  Rigorous group and individual critiques will be held on a regular basis.  Content is a priority in this class, and with the further understanding of ceramic processes and materials, the goal is for the student to be fluid in producing their ideas without the obstruction of technical difficulties.  In addition to the rigorous making of objects from start to finish our technical progression will be broken down into three parts:,Part one:,Testing and understanding of ceramic materials. Students will formulate their own glazes and clay bodies from raw ceramic materials.

. 
 (Formerly R3332) Sculpture III is an invitation for immersive sculpting. The class will explore the idea of experiences and construction of contexts as central research topics. The class becomes a laboratory space to explore various techniques to heighten body awareness and spatial sensibility. Through assignments and workshops, the students will practice how to digest these sensory experiences through their studio practice. Historical precedents for art outside the usual mediums and venues will be our reference points to investigate how our own work may take part in a generative process that evolves the definition of sculpture. The assignments in the first half of the semester point the students to performance, site specificity, and sound, that utilize New York City's odd spots and professionals. While building such common experiential platforms, the class will also build language for a dialogic space, through weekly in-class discussions lead by the instructor, guests, and rotating panels of the students. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from experiential learning to intensive studio work on a final project, where the students are asked to pay close attention to how various methods and fields of subjects combine. The resulting project has to be the best work you have ever done.

 (Formerly R3417) A concise study and application of the copper plate photogravure process. Usage of current available resources substituting for materials that are no longer available for photogravure. This is a 19th century obsolete photomechanical reproduction process that is constantly challenging the ingenuity of it's practitioners to keep it alive and a viable technique in the 21st century.  The course objectives are understanding and demonstrating proficiency in the photogravure process and creation of finished printed images from the process learned.

Designed as an intensive hands-on production/post-production workshop, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills in shooting, sound and editing will be emphasized. Assignments are developed to allow students to deepen their familiarity with the language of the moving image medium. Over the course of the term, the class will explore the language and syntax of the moving image, including fiction, documentary and experimental approaches. Importance will be placed on the decision making behind the production of a work; why it was conceived of, shot, and edited in a certain way. Class time will be divided between technical workshops, viewing and discussing films and videos by independent producers/artists and discussing and critiquing students projects. Readings will be assigned on technical, aesthetic and theoretical issues. Only one section offered per semester. If the class is full, please visit

And it cannot be excluded that these, language, voice, and speaking, appear in the name of a criticism or refusal of the very concepts linked to “sexual difference.”

Topics include: the role of political engagement, the gender dynamics of the classroom, and modes of critical thought and disagreement. Discussions can be oriented around student interest. The course will meet several times a month (dates TBD) and the final assignment is to develop a syllabus for a new gender/sexuality course in your field.  Because this course is required for graduate students choosing to fulfill Option 2 for the Graduate Certificate in Feminist Studies at IRWGS, priority will be given to graduate students completing the certificate.",Marianne Hirsch,6:10pm,8:00pm,62211,Morningside,GR8001-20181-001,FEMINIST PEDAGOGY,Women's and Gender Studies,WMST,http://culpa.info/professors/2424,silver,4.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Hirsch,https://web.archive.org///web/20171111233116/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WMST/GR8001-20181-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

WMST GU4506,GENDER JUSTICE,"This course will provide an introduction to the concrete legal contexts in which issues of gender and justice have been articulated, disputed and hesitatingly, if not provisionally, resolved. Readings will cover issues such as Workplace Equality, Sexual Harassment, Sex Role Stereotyping, Work/Family Conflict, Marriage and Alternatives to Marriage, Compulsory Masculinity, Parenting, Domestic Violence, Reproduction and Pregnancy, Rape, Sex Work & Trafficking. Through these readings we will explore the multiple ways in which the law has contended with sexual difference, gender-based stereotypes, and the meaning of equality in domestic, transnational and international contexts. So too, we will discuss how feminist theorists have thought about sex, gender and sexuality in understanding and critiquing our legal system and its norms.For more information, go to:

WRIT UN2110,FICTION SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 The modern short story has gone through many transformations, and the innovations of its practitioners have often pointed the way for prose fiction as a whole. The short story has been seized upon and refreshed by diverse cultures and aesthetic affiliations, so that perhaps the only stable definition of the form remains the famous one advanced by Poe, one of its early masters, as a work of fiction that can be read in one sitting. Still, common elements of the form have emerged over the last century and this course will study them, including Point of View, Plot, Character, Setting, and Theme. John Hawkes once famously called these last four elements the ""enemies of the novel,"" and many short story writers have seen them as hindrances as well. Hawkes later recanted, though some writers would still agree with his earlier assessment, and this course will examine the successful strategies of great writers across the spectrum of short story practice, from traditional approaches to more radical solutions, keeping in mind how one period's revolution - Hemingway, for example - becomes a later era's mainstream or ""common-sense"" storytelling mode. By reading the work of major writers from a writer's perspective, we will examine the myriad techniques employed for what is finally a common goal: to make readers feel. Short writing exercises will help us explore the exhilarating subtleties of these elements and how the effects created by their manipulation or even outright absence power our most compelling fictions.",Benjamin Marcus,12:10pm,2:00pm,69349,Morningside,UN2110-20181-001,APPROACHES TO THE SHORT STORY,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180121180648/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN2110-20181-001,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

YIDD UN1101,ELEMENTARY YIDDISH I,"This course offers an introduction to the language that has been spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews for more than a millennium, and an opportunity to discover a fabulous world of Yiddish literature, language and culture in a fun way. Using games, new media, and music, we will learn how to speak, read, listen and write in a language that is considered one of the richest languages in the world (in some aspects of vocabulary). We will also venture outside the classroom to explore the Yiddish world today: through field trips to Yiddish theater, Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, Yiddish organizations, such as YIVO or Yiddish farm, and so on. We will also have Yiddish-speaking guests and do a few digital projects. At the end of the two-semester course, you will be able to converse in Yiddish on a variety of everyday topics and read most Yiddish literary and non-literary texts.
