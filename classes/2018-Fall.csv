AFAS UN1001,INTRO TO AFRICAN-AMER STUDIES,"From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this “New World” democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S., but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the “middle passage” to the present so-called “post-racial” moment—drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature—to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e., agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e., migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e., uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e., Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.). By the end of the semester, students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of major themes/figures/traditions, alongside a range of cultural/political practices and institutional arrangements, in African-American Studies.",Josef Sorett,10:10am,11:25am,63368,Morningside,UN1001-20183-001,,"African-American Studies, Institute for Research in",AFAS,http://culpa.info/professors/9341,silver,3.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Sorett,https://web.archive.org///web/20180526095606/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AFAS/UN1001-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

While considering the formation of an architectural national identity, the course seeks to introduce new European and global perspectives. We will consider how a nascent history of architecture interacted with issues of theory, technology, science, culture, and the printing press. At the same time, the seminar will address questions of gender, as well as other social and political concerns. It will approach current debates on temporality, portability, materiality and fragmentation in architecture. Seminar meetings will center on major artists (e.g. Inigo Jones, Wren, Hawksmoor, Adam, Soane); different scales of architecture, from the city to the landscape; institutions and movements (e.g. Universities, the Royal Office of Works, Palladianism).

AHIS GR8484,DIGITIZATION AND (ANTI)DEMOCRACY,"The idea that technology––in particular information technologies––is democratizing is a truism whose origins go back to the postwar era. With the rise of digitization––i.e. the Internet, social media––this utopianism has accelerated, promising user autonomy, decentralization, and new forms of engagement and participation that will inevitably shape community and make the world a better place. This course seeks to problematize these claims by examining theories of digitization, democracy, and technical society. It questions the universalism that underlies such utopianism––in particular with regards to matters of race, gender, and ethnicity––approaching technologies as socially symbolic meanings that both build upon and produce new forms of knowledge, potentially engendering political inequality and 
anti
-democracy. Welcoming students from departments across the university, the course aims to generate a cross-disciplinary dialogue about these issues in relation to art, culture, and society.",Janet L Kraynak,2:10pm,4:00pm,91996,Morningside,GR8484-20183-001,DIGITIZATION&ANTI-DEMOCRACY;,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180613082111/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GR8484-20183-001/,832 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

AHIS GR8604,JAPANESE PHOTOGRAPHY,"Prerequisites: Instructor permission 
 This course will examine the history of Japanese photography from the middle of the 19th century to the present. The seminar will be organized both chronologically and thematically. Throughout its history, photography has been a powerful medium for addressing the most challenging issues facing Japanese society. Among the topics under discussion will be: tourist photography and the representation of women within that genre in the late 19th century, the politics of propaganda photography, the construction of Japanese cultural identity through the representation of “tradition” in photography, and the interest in marginalized urban subcultures in the photography of the 1960s and 1970s. Although the course will be focused on Japan, the class will read from the literature on photography elsewhere in order to situate Japanese work within a broader context.",Jonathan Reynolds,2:10pm,4:00pm,73317,Morningside,GR8604-20183-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/3923,silver,10.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180613072149/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GR8604-20183-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

AHIS GU4646,FOUCAULT AND THE ARTS,"Michel Foucault was a great historian and critic who helped change the ways research and criticism are done today – a new ‘archivist’. At the same time, he was a philosopher. His research and criticism formed part of an attempt to work out a new picture of what it is to think, and think critically, in relation to Knowledge, Power, and Processes of Subjectivization. What was this picture of thought? How did the arts, in particular the visual arts, figure in it? How might they in turn give a new image of Foucault’s kind of critical thinking for us today? In this course, we explore these questions, in the company of Deleuze, Agamben, Rancière and others thinkers and in relation to questions of media, document and archive in the current ‘regime of information’. The Seminar is open to students in all disciplines concerned with these issues.",John Rajchman,2:10pm,4:00pm,93496,Morningside,GU4646-20183-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rajchman,https://web.archive.org///web/20180613082426/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GU4646-20183-001/,934 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Topics will include art by Durer, Holbein, Velazquez, Watteau, Courbet, Morisot, Vertov, Deren, Godard, Varda, Hitchcock and others.

ANTH UN2026,ON PRECARITY,"The topic of precarity is a growing field in the social sciences. The main purpose of this course is to explore the wide semantics and potentials of the term in relation to domains such as labour, law, ethics, technology, health, relationships, moods, shifts in opinion, in fashions or the durability of goods. Our interest in precarity is grounded in two interrelated key motives: the first addresses it as an object of study in its own right. Judging from recent unemployment rates of the industrialized west, the mass scale displacement of populations or the corrosion of security, there is enough reason to put precarity into context. Yet, we might also proceed by inquiring about its potentials as a methodology, one might even call it “a style of reasoning”.  Given how much history relies on causation, sequence and linearity how to relate to precarity as a temporal structure in light of the complexities of the present? How does such multilateral present redefines the very conception of that present, of the historical and the now? 
 We will be relating to precarity not just as a condition of existence but also as an infrastructure with which to think societies across space and time. The course will focus on narratives, practices and structures that problematize and displace prima facie logics of the either/or. Instead, we want to highlight conjoined operations of the both/and which are changing the very nature of how we think norms, time and episteme. Taking a clue from the proliferation of forms of precarity, the course will be organized around specific themes. Within each two-week section, the first sessions will be a lecture and the remaining will combine lecture and discussion of the assigned items. As a whole, the course aims to sensitize students to the complexities and conditioning possibilities involved in the process of knowledge-making and to provide students with tools to better structure and critically access the information they receive and generate.",Maria Jose de Abreu,6:10pm,7:25pm,63942,Morningside,UN2026-20183-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180909052114/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/UN2026-20183-001,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

BIOL 3700
 will provide an opportunity for students interested in independent research work in a hospital or hospice setting. In these settings, where patients and their needs are paramount, and where IRB rules and basic medical ethics make “wet-lab biology research” inappropriate, undergraduates may well find a way nevertheless, to assist and participate in ongoing clinical research. Such students, once they have identified a mentor willing to provide support, participation, and advising, may apply to the faculty member in charge of the course for 2-4 points/semester in 
BIOL W3700
. This course will closely follow procedures already in place for 
BIOL 3500

CLEN GU4559,LITERATURE AND INTERSECTONAL FEMINSM,"The term “intersectional feminism” has seen renewed currency in the last year or so, but the methodologies and theories of intersectional feminisms have a much longer history. Kimberlé Crenshaw first theorized “intersectional feminism” as a critical framework in the 1990s. Crenshaw’s initial formation, however (as she herself has recognized), was conversant with a longer history of woman-of-color, transnational, and postcolonial feminisms. This seminar focuses on historicizing and examining contemporary literature through an intersectional approach that combines woman-of-color feminisms, transnational and global feminisms, postcolonial studies, queer studies, and disability studies. How do these texts imagine these crossings? What possible complexities, conflicts, or coalitions emerge? Since formal innovation has long been critical to foundational work in gender and sexuality studies scholars and writers, who often weave together art, practice, and politics, we will read theory as literature and literature as theory, and we will closely analyze links between intersectional feminisms and form, aesthetics, and genre.",Denise Cruz,2:10pm,4:00pm,66246,Morningside,GU4559-20183-001,LIT & INTERSCTNAL FEMINSM,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,http://culpa.info/professors/13723,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180902112509/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/GU4559-20183-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

 (Seminar). This course examines literary and artistic works by and about women from the 16th and 17th centuries alongside recent historical and theoretical criticism on gender and sexuality in the Renaissance. We will cover a range of literary genres that reflect and produce early modern notions of sex and gender in England, France, Italy and Spain, as well as medical guides, self-portraits, conduct manuals, and scurrilous tracts on females behavior. Topics include Queens (rulers) and Queens (prostitutes); cross-dressing and biological difference; the status of work and school; separatist communities and same-sex eroticism; kinship, patronage and domesticity; the gender and economics of authorship; the sexuality of racial and national identity.

CLIA GU4022,DIASPORAS IN ITALIAN&TRANSITIONAL; HISTOR,"Some years ago the word Diaspora referred to Jews and was spelled with a capital D. Today, almost every ethnic group, country, or separatist movement has its diaspora. Usually, these diasporas are presented as pieces of national life scattered here and there, in places far away from the national core. In this seminar, however, we will treat diasporas not as an emblem of national unity but as an expression of diversity, of a multiplicity of loyalties and belongings. By combining history, literature, film, and cultural studies, and by approaching the topic through the lens of transnationalism, we will study topics such as Mobility and Nationalism, Diasporas in Intellectual History, The Mediterranean in Motion, Italian Migration, Mobile Italy and its Colonies, Displacements in the Eastern Mediterranean, Lost Cosmopolitanisms in the Middle East, Emigration from Eastern Europe, and Mediterranean Refugees and Memory. The aim is to turn our gaze away from the territorially defined countries, towards a view of the world in which countries are ship-like territories.",Konstantia Zanou,6:10pm,8:00pm,66896,Morningside,GU4022-20183-001,DIASPORAS IN ITALIAN&TRANSITIO;,Italian,CLIA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180907015834/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLIA/GU4022-20183-001,407 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

CLME GU4226,ARABIC AUTOBIOGRAPHY GLOBAL DIMENSIONS,"This course draws a map of Arab thought and culture in its multiple engagements with other cultures. It works globally along two lines: a theoretical one that accommodates conceptualizations of self-narrative in relation to shifting categories of center and margin; and a thematic one that selects a number of Arabic autobiographical texts with strong thematic concerns that cut across multiple cultures. Although Europe sounds at times more conspicuous in early 20th century autobiography, the Afro-Asian and Latin American topographical and historical itinerary and context are no less so, especially in writings we associate with societal and cultural transformations. More than historical accounts, these intellectual itineraries speak for the successes and failures of the secular ideology of the Arab nation-state. They convey the struggle of intellectuals-- as self-styled leaders, for an ideal state on the ruins of the past. The course studies a number of autobiographical works; memoirs and reminiscences that are meant to rationalize and reproduce a writerâ€™s experience. Probably self-censored, these serve nevertheless as trajectories for a secular journey rather than one from denial to affirmation. Staunchly established in modernity and its nahdah paradigms, most of these writings are secular itineraries that rarely end in a search for faith. They are the journeys of a generation of Arab intellectuals who are facing many crises, but not the crisis of faith. They provide another look at the making of the Arab intelligentsia- and probably the Afro-Asian and Latin American one, since the early 20th century, and help us discern not only achievements on the level of education and public service , but also the mounting discontent with failures that have been wrapping the formation of the nation state.No prior knowledge of Arabic language is required.",Muhsin Al-Musawi,2:10pm,4:00pm,72475,Morningside,GU4226-20183-001,ARABIC AUTOBIOGRAPHY:GLOB DMNS,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",CLME,http://culpa.info/professors/2605,silver,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180624160753/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLME/GU4226-20183-001/,207 Knox Hall,,"Barnard

CLPS GU4223,SEXUAL SCIENCE? WRIT&EPIS;,"Mallarmé saw writing as a “mad game” 
[“ce jeu insensé d’écrire”]. 
Following Blanchot following Mallarmé, Foucault equaled literature’s writing again with “madness 
[folie]”
 and then both with the enigmatic thought of an “absence of work 
[absence d
’œuvre
].”
 
By bringing together close readings and references to clinical experience, this course hopes to show that 
writing
 lies at the heart of psychoanalysis. We will also ask what share of the “mad game” is written into this heart, and how it is linked to the epistemological adventure of psychoanalysis. Is it a science that doesn’t work but still keeps writing? 
In Freud we will trace a poetics that secretly informs the careful 
constructions
 of his concepts and theoretical compositions. With Schreber we will analyze a drive to find a 
formula 
for the mad experience, a drive that does not only inform his own 
Memoirs of my Nervous Illness
 but whose transference can be read in founding texts of psychoanalytic writing on psychosis. In Lacan we will comment on his intention to force a 
reduction
 of psychoanalytic discourse to such an extent that it may yield the letters of a “writing of the real.” 
By elaborating these three moments of writing – (poetic) 
construction
, (mad) 
formalization
, (literal) 
reduction
 – we will ask what they have to do with the “sexual” – the word, the concept, the thing, and its metonymies (transference, libido, drive, affect, Eros) – with the “sexual”, this other “heart” of psychoanalysis. How does it pulse beat in the psychoanalytic epistemology?",Marcus Coelen,4:10pm,6:00pm,62196,Morningside,GU4223-20183-001,SEXUAL SCIENCE?

First, are there continuities in Jewish literary style and rhetorical strategy, and if so, what are they? And second, can Jewish literature help us to understand the tensions between universality and particularity inherent in comic literature more generally?

Rather than foregrounding a single case study, the syllabus is organized around the proposition that any consideration of diaspora requires a consideration of comparative and overlapping diasporas, and as a consequence a confrontation with multilingualism, creolization and the problem of translation. The final weeks of the course will be devoted to a practicum, in which we will conduct an intensive workshop around the translation projects of the student participants.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,70059,Morningside,GR6111-20183-001,COMP DIASPORAS & TRANSLAT,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180624160755/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR6111-20183-001/,To be announced,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,3,,T,20183CPLS6111G001,SEMINAR
CPLS GR6333,EAST/WEST FRAMETALE NARRATIVES,"Frametale narratives, the art of inserting stories within stories, in oral and written forms, originated in East and South Asia centuries ago; tales familiar to Europe, often called novellas, can trace their development from oral tales to transmitted Sanskrit and Pahlavi tales, as well as Arabic and Hebrew stories. Both Muslim Spain and Christian Spain served as the nexus between the East and Europe in the journey of translation and the creation of new works. Through readings and films, and employing the theoretical concepts of Homi Bhabha (liminality, hybridity, third space) and Etienne Balibar (frontiers and the nation), as well as selected readings of Fernand Braudel and others on the Mediterranean world, the course examines the structure, meaning, and function of ancient, medieval, and early modern frametale narratives, using as theoretical frame in three ways: 1) Theory and practice of frames. Frames are not neutral; they can be narrative seductions, guiding and even strongly manipulating how we read the stories that follow; they can be used to reflect the intersections of orality and literacy. In order to understand their enduring power, we also explore the idea of literary frames through some contemporary films. 2) The exploration in their cultural contexts of topics such as the literary figures of the anti-hero and the trickster, precursors to the picaresque, women in the courtroom, the conflict of chance and human agency, monstrous births as political prophecy, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish relations in medieval and early modern Mediterranean cultures, the sexual frankness of the novella form, and gender politics. 3) How are narratives formed? The course traces the development of the short tale/novella from its ancient Asian origins through the seventeenth century, when Cervantes' literary experiments gave new life to the novella form, and the Spanish writer María de Zayas challenged Cervantes' views on love and marriage in her own highly regarded collections of novellas; we move to the present with the study of three contemporary films. But before they became complex and entertaining narratives, many of the well known tales had their ""bare bones"" origins in joke books, laws and legal theories, conduct manuals, collections of aphorisms and other wise and pithy sayings, misogynist non-fiction writings, and Biblical stories. Although the works are available in English translations, lectures will refer to meanings in both English and the original languages; students who can read the original works in",Patricia E Grieve,1:00pm,3:00pm,19087,Morningside,GR6333-20183-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,http://culpa.info/professors/1594,,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180622131058/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR6333-20183-001/,505 Casa Hispánica,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

CPLS GR6368,68 EFFECT IN FRENCH PHILOSOPHY,"Behind this project is a conviction that, for each of the important figures of what is now generally called “French Theory” (a label imported from U.S. Universities), the “May 68 events” in Paris (and elsewhere) represented a 
surprise
 and created an 
interruption
 in the course of their speculations and researches. This can be identified in some cases in the form of a “self-criticism”, in others as new collaborations and a shift in intellectual “alliances”, but above all in the form of a discovery of new objects and an invention of new terminologies. At stake would be, no doubt, a more direct way of interweaving the “conceptual” and the “political” in philosophy, but more profoundly the very notion of the political (whose traditional definitions, institutional or revolutionary, found themselves devalued in the course of the events), the representation of the “intellectual”, and what Deleuze later would call the “image of thought”. It is this change that we want to address in the seminar, by focusing on a selection of essays that can be read as a “reaction” to the event in the field of theory. They will be presented in the frame of 
dialogic confrontations
 around 
three themes
: 
 
1) “Discourse”
 (Foucault and Lacan); 
 
2) “Desire” 
(Deleuze-Guattari, Irigaray and “Mouvement de Libération des Femmes”); 
 
3) “Reproduction”
 (Althusser and Bourdieu-Passeron). 
 This is a limited choice indeed, which nevertheless we hope may help elucidate how philosophers at the time 
wrote in the conjuncture

CPLS GR8867,S CONTEMP CRITICAL THOUGHT,"“In politics,” Reinhart Koselleck writes at the end of his essay on the modern concept of revolution, “words and their usage are more important than any other weapon.” Perhaps. Or perhaps not. Perhaps it is action that matters more than words, ultimately—political engagement, praxis, “agir.” Perhaps the words, in the end, merely catch up with the things. Regardless, a central question arises: In an age that may be considered post-revolutionary (but that too is a question), how should we understand and theorize collective action and individual political engagement? This seminar seeks to answer that question through a sustained, critical examination of different contemporary forms of political upheaval. The purpose of this seminar series, then, is to explore various modalities of uprising, disobedience, inservitude, revolt, or other forms of political contestation. Instead of including them all under the name of “revolution”—a term that has become conceptually and historically fraught—we are interested in considering how specific experiences and discourses articulate new forms of upheaval or reformulate well-known ones. By focusing on this conceptual, historical and political problematic, we intend to shine a light on experiences and manifestations that take place at the local and at the global level, as well as at the subjective and the collective level. The idea is to articulate how critical political practice is expressed and understood today. 
 This is a year-long course (Y course). Columbia GSAS students will be required to take both Fall and Spring semesters of this course.

We will not treat either of these categories of difference as a given, nor as separable from other axes of social difference. Rather, we will apply an interdisciplinary and intersectional framework to illuminate how these concepts have come to emerge and cohere within a number of familiar and less familiar socio-cultural and historical contexts. We will consider how racial and ethnic differentiation as fraught but powerful processes have bolstered global labor regimes and imperial expansion projects; parsed, managed, and regulated populations; governed sexed and gendered logics of subject and social formation; and finally, opened and constrained axes of self-understanding, political organization, and social belonging. Special attention will be given to broadening students' understanding of racial and ethnic differentiation beyond examinations of identity.

From the judicial and popular riots in the U.S. justified by recurrent rumors of African-American insurrection, to accusations that French Jews were players in the 'white slave trade,' to tales of white fat-stealing monsters among indigenous people of Bolivia and Peru, rumors play a key role in constructing, enforcing, and contesting regimes of racial identity and domination. In order to grasp rumor's importance for race, we will need to understand how it works, so our readings will cover both instances of racialized rumor-telling, conspiracy theories and mass panics, and some key approaches to how rumors work as a social phenomenon.

DNCE BC3567,DANCES OF INDIA,"A range of dance genres, from the traditional to the innovative, co-exist as  representations of  ""Indianness"" in India,  and beyond. Identities onstage and in films, morph as colonial, national, and global contexts change.  This course zooms from micro to macro views of twentieth century staged dances as culturally inflected discourse. We review how Indian classical dance aligns with the oldest of performance texts, and with lively discourses (rasa as a performance aesthetic, Orientalism, nationalism,  global recirculations) through the ages, not only in India but also in Europe, Britain and America. Throughout the course, we ask:-  How is culture embodied? How do historical texts configure dance today? How might they affect our thinking on mind-body, practice-theory, and traditional-contemporary divides?  How does bodily patterning influence the ways that we experience our surroundings and vice versa?  Can cultural imaginaries  instigate action?

EAAS GR8042,CLASSICAL CHINESE POETRY,"This graduate seminar reads canonical medieval poems against their relevant counterparts in leishu (compendiums arranged by classification systems that served as writing handbooks). We examine these compendiums as thresholds—lying outside the poems as their ostensible background material, these thesholds not only frame questions of genre and genealogy but also mediate the borders of poems. Some questions posed by this course: What conceptual paradigms are operative in the deployment of particular classifications? What are the implications for interpretive practice to regard a genre not as an archetype of abstracted qualities but, as these compendiums suggest, as something embodied by exemplars? Insofar as categories are organized by intertextual references, what is the relationship between lei and the work of allusion? What are the criteria and ramifications for determining the operative scope of allusions—are ‘contiguous’ but elided passages also in play? What is the family resemblance between leishu and commentaries like that of Li Shan for the Wenxuan anthology that do not so much give glosses as draw intertextual relationships? In what ways do lei furnish genealogies for things? What are the limits of ‘close reading’ on one hand and sprawling ‘intertextuality’ on the other?",Harrison Huang,2:10pm,4:00pm,16919,Morningside,GR8042-20183-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180623105138/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EAAS/GR8042-20183-001/,4A KRAFT CENTER,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

We will examine how this literature repudiates the repressions, violence and chaos of the Maoist era and speaks to the collective experience of Chinese intellectuals. We will analyze how this body of testimonial literature and related film productions bear witness to the suffering of intellectuals and render it commensurate or not commensurate with the genre of Holocaust literature. Our goal is to achieve a deeper understanding of the tragedy of the Cultural Revolution and its historical roots beyond analogical thinking.

It engages issues of performance practices and dramatic texts; thus, the course draws on material from theater history, performance and acting conventions, and the literary history of drama. Students will learn about the major genres of dramatic writing and their different modes of performance, including the Chinese dramatic genres of zaju and chuanqi; Chinese performance styles of Beijing opera and Kunqu; and Japanese dramatic genres of noh, kyōgen, kabuki, and puppet theater (or bunraku). This course also gives students the opportunity to engage closely with dramatic texts as literature, and encourages detailed readings of some canonical and non-canonical plays. We will consider how dramatic writing and theatrical performance relate to broader trends in socio-political history and literary history, and will also explore how dramatic texts and theatrical performance embody a multivalent and multi-sensory space that is unique among creative enterprises. We deal with both the actor and the text, and consider how each are conditioned by modern and premodern contexts.

EAAS UN3121,MINORITY LITERATURE IN MODERN CHINA,"While the rise of China on the world stage has resulted in enormous interest in modern Chinese society, this interest has been directed largely at the culture and concerns of China’s majority ethnicity: the Han. Ethnicity is central to any discussion of society and culture in the West, and this course will seek to place it at the forefront of our understanding of modern China as well.  China is officially a country comprised of 56 distinct peoples or “nationalities” (including the Han Chinese majority). In the literature presented here, translated both from Chinese and minority languages, students will have the opportunity to hear the rich and varied voices of China’s minority writers first hand, and through them gain an understanding of the key issues surrounding ethnicity in modern China. We will cover fiction, poetry, essays, and film by a broad range of different peoples: Tibetans, Mongols, Manchus, the Islamic Uyghur nationality of Xinjiang province, the Yi of southwestern Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, the indigenous writers of Taiwan, and others. We will pay close attention to how minority writers explore and assert their identities in a Han-dominated society, how their work can broaden our understanding of the cultural diversity at play in modern China, and how it can challenge our conventional definitions of what constitutes modern Chinese literature and culture. The course begins by considering the role of ethnicity and nation in the birth and development of Chinese literature in the 20th century, before moving on to examine works by specific ethnicities. Finally, we will address certain issues faced by minorities in China that cut across ethnic lines. Throughout, we will address some of the most pressing concerns of minority ethnicities, concerns that are deeply significant not only to our understanding of modern China, but to the modern world at large. Familiarity with Chinese or related cultural context beneficial, but not required.",Christopher Peacock,4:10pm,6:00pm,76029,Morningside,UN3121-20183-001,MINORITY LIT MODERN CHINA,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,http://culpa.info/professors/2395,silver,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180623103433/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EAAS/UN3121-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

This course offers an introduction basic science of the carbon cycle, with a focus on large-scale processes occurring on annual to centennial timescales. Students will leave this course with an understanding of the degree to which the global carbon cycle is understood and quantified, as well as the key uncertainties that are the focus of current research. We will build understanding of the potential pathways, and the significant challenges, to limiting global warming to 2o C as intended by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The course will begin with a brief review of climate science basics and the role of CO2 in climate and climate change (weeks 1-2). In weeks 3-4, the natural reservoirs and fluxes that make up the global carbon cycle will be introduced. In week 5-6, anthropogenic emissions and the observed changes in climate associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 will be discussed. In weeks 7-11, we will learn about how the land biosphere and ocean are mitigating the increase in atmospheric CO2 and the feedbacks that may substantially modify these natural sinks. In weeks 12-13, the international policy process and the potential for carbon cycle management will be the focus. In weeks 14, students will present their final projects",Galen A McKinley,11:40am,12:55pm,18646,Morningside,GU4020-20183-001,,Earth and Environmental Sciences,EESC,http://culpa.info/professors/13985,,1.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen_McKinley,https://web.archive.org///web/20190106045838/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/GU4020-20183-001,555 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

 Where do our (often unconscious) assumptions about our world and our place in it come from? This course explores key intellectual moments in the literature of the Mediterranean world, whose ideas gave rise to the structures governing much of the Western world today -- structures that sustain and perpetuate ideas about power, authority, gender, and morality that influence our lives in ways both visible and invisible. We read these texts, primarily imaginative literature, to see how they reify, comment upon, resist and/or imagine alternatives to existing social and ideological structures; reading in this way allows us to consciously name and examine how ideology both shifts over time and, in vital ways, remains constant, inviting us to question the myth of progress at the heart of canonicity.

 Welcome to (near) total freedom.  This class is an introduction to writing poetry, keeping the taillights of traditional English verse in mind, while exploring contemporary ideas of poetic theory and practice.  Poetry prompts, assignments, visiting poets, peer workshops, and attention to revision will help us tease out the Creator within.   We will be writing lyric poems, which embody a kind of “psychological wisdom,” giving us a believable representation of what 19th century poet Matthew Arnold called “the dialogue of the mind with itself.”  Among the questions we’ll explore:  How do imagination, “real life,” and conscious artifice (among other things) enter into the writing of poems?  How does a poem interface with its reader/listener?  What’s the role of enigma, or even opacity, in poetry?  How much clarity or accessibility is desirable?  We will also linger over and consider the import and function of the poetic image remembering, as Ezra Pound wrote, “The image is more than an idea. It is a vortex or cluster of fused ideas and is endowed with energy.” Regular attendance, full participation in class discussions, timely completion of assignments journal, and the submission of a final portfolio of poems are requirements for earning credit in this class.",,12:10pm,2:00pm,03333,Barnard College,BC3110-20183-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908212137/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3110-20183-001/,403 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL BC3177,VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE,"“We have become a novel-reading people,” wrote Anthony Trollope in 1870. “Novels are in the hands of us all; from the Prime Minister down to the last-appointed scullery maid.” This course will consider why the novel was so important to Victorian culture and society. What made the Victorian novel such a fertile form for grappling with the unprecedented cultural changes of the nineteenth century? To address this question, we will explore how Victorian novels both responded to, and participated in, major social and cultural shifts of the period, including industrialism and urbanization; colonialism and empire; the changing status of women, sexuality, and marriage; the emergence of Darwinism; class conflict and social reform; and the expansion of education and literacy. This course will also consider more broadly what novels are for, and what the Victorians thought they were for. Do novels represent the world as it really is, or do they imagine it as it ought to be? What kinds of solutions to social and political problems can novels offer? Can novels ethically improve (or corrupt) their readers? We will consider these issues in the context of realism, Victorian literature’s trademark genre, but we’ll also explore an array of other genres, such as the industrial novel, the Bildungsroman, the sensation novel, detective fiction, and gothic fiction. Authors include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Wilkie Collins, and others.",Rebecca J Hildebrand,11:40am,12:55pm,01271,Barnard College,BC3177-20183-001,VICTORIAN LITERATURE: THE NOVE,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908212319/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3177-20183-001/,302 Barnard Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL GR6109,TROILUS AND CRISEYDE,"The central work of this seminar will be a slow and attentive reading of 
Troilus and Criseyde
, using the entire semester.   Each week, in addition, we will read and discuss a wide range of related materials, to include: theoretical strategies (especially the post-Lacanian notion of the neighbor), iconography and manuscript setting, genre affiliations (romance, historiography, philosophy), the broader Trojan narrative tradition, the medieval city, the medieval imagination of the antique past, earlier and later texts in dialogue with 
Troilus
 (Boethius, Ovid, Statius’ 
Thebaid
, Lydgate’s 
Troy Book
 and Henryson’s 
Testament of Cresseid, 
Spenser and Shakespeare), Troilus and Chaucer’s own textual past and future. 
At the same time, the seminar will explore what recent theoretical statements about the neighbor and hospitality can bring to our reading of 
Troilus
, both in terms of its place in a broad textual tradition, and in terms of its plot, urban setting, and thematics of intimacy.  Readings will draw from Derrida, Kenneth Reinhard, Slavoj Zizek, and others.  Toward this end, each student will select a “neighborly” text, from any period, to read with and against 
Troilus
.  
While the course will be relevant to medievalists, it is consciously designed equally to serve (and it is hoped, to attract) students from very different periods.  Non-medievalists will be encouraged to draw upon their expertises (both in period and theoretical methodology).  Course work by non-medievalists can focus on their own future work, either by writing on Troilus and Troy in later traditions, or by pedagogical presentations and essays.

ENGL GR6412,SECRECY/SCANDAL-VICTORIAN LIT,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). This course aims to follow up on James's sense that English literature and society in the latter half of the nineteenth century had become newly preoccupied with secrecy, which nurtured habits of reading that we've come to call hermeneutics of suspicion. One broad explanation is the rise of ""information culture"": an ever-increasing accumulation of overlooked or unattended knowledge that became valuable through publication. The exposure of hidden or secret knowledge had especially pointed implications for personal identity: in a world of ever-increasing social mobility, efforts at self-fashioning were met by newly keen modes of scrutiny and surveillance, which sought out ""deep"" or compromising components of the self, the material of scandal.  In this seminar we""ll explore this preoccupation with secrecy and scandal in two major Victorian cultural developments, sensation fiction and the rise of aestheticism. In sensation fiction, blackmail and exposure narratives underscored the alienation of personal identity into information -- legal records, correspondence, handwriting, even a birthmark -- whose appropriation by observers confounded the effort to escape from one's past. In aestheticism, art frequently was presented as an initiation into arcane or forbidden experience, in which the appeal to secrecy could be both a defensive mechanism and a means of soliciting and communicating with a like-minded but guarded audience. In connecting these two phenomena, we'll try to relate literary strategies of obliquity or indirection with social dynamics of secrecy and exposure.",James E Adams,2:10pm,4:00pm,64495,Morningside,GR6412-20183-001,SECRECY AND SCANDAL,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/9599,silver,11.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180521172659/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6412-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ENGL GR6529,ANIMAL STUDIES,"Animal studies has developed over the past decade as a major area of study across the humanities and social sciences. Some authors have asked about the co-evolution of humans and animals and others have questioned the ethics of using animals for experimentation in scientific labs. Others still question the carceral logics of pet-owning. The question of the animal inevitably raises the question of the human, and so philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Giles Deleuze have used the indifference of the non-human animal to the human to theorize about consciousness, recognition and regard. Donna Haraway, on the other hand, has argued that humans and dogs are engaged in a mutual exercise of training and adapting, a set of practices that questions the centralization of the human within evolutionary narratives. Animal studies has also been the site for debates about human categories like race and gender and how they deploy the human-animal relation to make claims about barbarity, violence, civility and instinct. 
 Using a set of literary and cinematic texts, this graduate course will track the way we represent non-human animals in the modern period and what those representations imply about our unquestioned assumptions about sex, intimacy and embodiment. Bringing animals studies together with queer studies, critical race studies and decolonial knowledge, this course questions ultimately not the category of the animal but our investment in the human.",Jack Halberstam,4:10pm,6:00pm,18046,Morningside,GR6529-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Halberstam,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908213028/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6529-20183-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ENGL GR6614,FORMS OF NEW WORLD NARRATIVE,"(Seminar). This seminar focuses on the relation between New World encounters and narrative form.  It draws on an array of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century genres ranging from exploration and travel narratives to natural histories, novels, long poems, and medical treatises, among others.  Rather than organizing this literary history by specific national, formal, or generic conventions, we will seek to understand the relation between those conventions and the evolution of colonialism in the New World.  The course will lean heavily on early Caribbean material, and be attentive to the circulation of bodies and knowledge throughout the Atlantic world.  We will examine the ways that writers narrate their observations and experiences, and inquire into the formal and narrative choices at their disposal.  When and where do they make these choices, and to what effect?  How do these choices affect the forms of their texts and shape the ways that we critics understand those forms as literary (or non-literary) productions?",Cristobal J Silva,12:10pm,2:00pm,27846,Morningside,GR6614-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/10802,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908213033/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6614-20183-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

 helps undergraduates engage in the conversations that form our intellectual community. By reading and writing about scholarly and popular essays, students learn that writing is a process of continual refinement of ideas. Rather than approaching writing as an innate talent, this course teaches writing as a learned skill. We give special attention to textual analysis, research, and revision practices. University Writing offers the following themed sections, all of which welcome students with no prior experience studying the theme. Students interested in a particular theme should register for the section within the specified range of section numbers.

 2) to learn how to relate literary works to their historical circumstances; 
 3) to define the novel as a genre; 
 4) to explore the relationship between realism and counter-realisms (gothic, melodrama, sensation, fantasy, the supernatural); 
 5) to acquire a technical understanding of novelistic form by analyzing how novelists use point of view and narrative voice; construct character, delineate space, and represent time; and establish symmetries that give even the baggiest monsters coherence.",Sharon Marcus,5:40pm,6:55pm,19694,Morningside,GU4408-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/1845,gold,8.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Marcus,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908213257/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4408-20183-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL GU4593,"SEDUCTION,SLAVERY,SBULIMITY-AMER NOVEL","We’ll trace the remarkable developments of the novel form in the U.S, from the decade after the Revolution (when Americans first begin to write long prose fictions) to the decade before the Civil War (when the American novel claimed its ascent to literary Art). All along the way, we will be reading “novels,” yes, but it will quickly become apparent how varied a thing this noun actually names; we’ll read a broad range of the novel’s different modes (the epistolary novel, the novel of seduction, the gothic, the historical novel, sentimental-domestic fiction, the Romance). We begin in the 1780s, when the American novel is just trying to find its feet, and yet sees itself as having a profound political duty to serve the national interest. Even fictional writings about sexual conduct—the seduction novels with which we begin the course—charged themselves with this grave nationalist purpose. We then follow the form through the early nineteenth century, as it becomes obsessed with the topics of race and violence that threaten to destroy the young nation. As strange as it may sound, these novelists seemed to believe that they could resolve massive real-world crises, particularly those surrounding slavery and white-Indian conflicts over land ownership, in fictional terms. We end in the 1850s, when American novels instead began to insist on their separateness and autonomy from poltics and the world as it is, boasting of their ability to transcend everyday life to achieve “Literature” with a capital L. We thus spend the last month of the course with the widely advertised literary masterworks of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, asking ourselves how the novel had progressed from an openly didactic form of social consciousness to a species of writing that could open a world of sublime aesthetic experience. Readings will include works by: Hannah Webster Foster (
The Coquette
), Charles Brockden Brown (
Edgar Huntly
), James Fenimore Cooper (
The Last of the Mohicans
), Harriet Beecher Stowe (
Uncle Tom’s Cabin
), Martin Delany (

ENGL GU4599,BIOETHICS AND NARRATIVE,"Bioethics grapples with some of the most charged issues of our contemporary moment:  where life begins and ends, the definition of personhood, the role of technology in creating, shaping, and sustaining human life, the significance of genetic information, the scientific basis of race and gender, allocation of medical resources, relations among doctors, scientists, patients, and families.  Although these issues concern us all, they tend to be debated by select groups of specialists, favoring the perspectives of philosophers, doctors, scientists, and clinicians.  This course offers an alternative by considering bioethical questions through the lens of consumers, patients, research subjects, family members and caregivers.  Rather than privileging the “case study,” a genre that provides the clinician’s view of the bioethical scenario, we will focus on stories, asking how narrative provides new insight and bring attention to previously unrepresented points of view.  Each week, narratives in film and print will be paired with critical readings that highlight the bioethical issues at stake.",Rachel Adams,2:40pm,3:55pm,17996,Morningside,GU4599-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/904,,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180521170940/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4599-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ENGL UN3001,LITERARY TEXTS & CRIT METHODS,"Prerequisites: Students who register for ENGL UN3001 must also register for one of the sections of ENGL UN3011 Literary Texts, Critical Methods. 
 This course is intended to introduce students to the advanced study of literature. Students will read works from different genres (poetry, drama, and prose fiction), drawn from the medieval period to the present day, learning the different interpretative techniques required by each. The course also introduces students to a variety of critical schools and approaches, with the aim both of familiarizing them with these methodologies in the work of other critics and of encouraging them to make use of different methods in their own critical writing. This course (together with the companion seminar 
ENGL UN3011

ENGL UN3002,"HUMANITIES TEXTS, CRIT SKILLS","This course aims to equip students with critical tools for approaching, reading, and striving with literary and philosophical texts—ancient as well as modern. To this end, we will be working closely with a set of texts that range in date from the 8th/7th c. BCE to the 20th century C, including: Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Du Bois, Nabokov and Rankine. Our seminar will operate on the assumption that we cannot know “what” these texts say or “what” their authors mean unless we come to grips with how they say what they say and how they mean what they mean. In pursuit of some answers, we will master the skill of reading quickly but carefully, balancing attention to the literary craft of our texts with scrutiny of their underlying arguments and agendas.

We will first turn to what became known as “yellow peril,” one effect of exclusion laws that monitored the entrance of Asians into the United States and Canada during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the corresponding phenomenon of Orientalism, the fascination with a binary of Asia and the West. The second section of the course will focus on how Asian North American authors respond to later cycles of love and fear, ranging from the forgetting of Japanese internment in North America and the occupation of the Philippines; to the development of the model minority mythology during the Cold War.

ENGL UN3635,SPECULATIVE FICTION AND THE ENVIRONMENT,"The act of speculation is central to our thinking about the environment, be it through projections of catastrophe, visions of a more sustainable society, or conceptualizations of vast and complex planetary systems. This course will explore this form of speculation by tracing the intersection of speculative fiction and environmentalism in the American twentieth century, the setting for the maturation of the genre and the movement alike. For the purposes of this course, “speculative fiction” (SF) will be taken to include the commonly accepted genre of science-fiction and fantasy as well as any work of fiction based on a counterfactual present world, an extrapolative future, an alternative past, or a reality entirely imagined. More conceptually, we will consider SF in the expansive sense Donna Haraway proposes: “science fiction, speculative fabulation, string figures, speculative feminism, science fact, so far,” asking what these distinct but related acts of mind can reveal about environmental thought. The semester will be divided into pre-1960 and post-1960 works, a boundary that on one hand divides the Golden Age and New Wave periods of science fiction, and on the other hand roughly marks the birth of the modern environmental movement. As the course moves chronologically through representative works of environmental SF, it will also trace the development of foundational concepts in ecology and environmentalism by cross-referencing works of SF with texts in ecology and environmentalist theory that either established or discuss contemporaneous theories. This exploration will touch on topics such as: ecofeminism, ecological economics, ecological succession and the climax community, the Gaia hypothesis, environmental justice, and early recognitions of climate change.",Phillip R Polefrone,12:10pm,2:00pm,28279,Morningside,UN3635-20183-001,SPECULATIVE FICT & ENVIRONMENT,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/13389,gold,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180521174404/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3635-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ENGL UN3712,HENRY JAMES AND EDITH WHARTON,"James & Wharton, America's two greatest novelists in the half century after the civil war and the eve of the first world war, were friends and fellow cosmopolitans, at home in the US  & Europe, chroniclers of an emerging transatlantic urban modernity traversing New York, London, Paris, Rome, Geneva. Their fiction often portrays glamorous surfaces and intricate social texts that their brilliant heroines --Isabel Archer  of 
The Portrait of a Lady 
& Lily Bart of 
The House of Mirth
,  for example--negotiate with wit and subtlety, confusion and daring,  amidst fear and fascination. They find themselves immersed in bruising plots--crafted by society's disciplinary imperatives and by their creators, the latter standing in uneasy complicity with the social order even as they seek its transformation.  Giving female protagonists unprecedented boldness and ambition, Wharton & James chart how intense exertion of will and desire collides with ""the customs of the country,"" to cite the title of a great Wharton novel. We will read the three novels mentioned above as well as Wharton's

ENGL UN3823,AUSTEN & THE ENLIGHTENMENT MIND,"This course explores the conceptual origins of ""sense"" and ""sensibility"" in the work of the eighteenth-century's most radical thinkers. We will discover how Jane Austen responded to and reformulated major intellectual and political debates of the Enlightenment, and so brought the novel to full fruition as a philosophical medium. We will ground our approach to Austen's novels in contemporary theories of human behavior, psychology, and right--from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who devised a system of education which might utterly subject the female spirit to male desire; to Mary Wollstonecraft and Ottobah Cugoano, whose philosophies respectively equate marriage with slavery, and urge slaves to rise and destroy their captors.  We will read in full most of Austen's completed novels and a sampling of her juveneilia, as well as extensive excerpts from major philosophical works of the Enlightenment.

ENGL UN3850,"FICTION, INTERSUBJECTIVIY, RELATIONALITY","We begin in relation, helpless and dependent. ""You, reader, are alive today, reading this, because someone once adequately policed your mouth exploring,"" writes Maggie Nelson. This course will explore the ""relational turn,"" which proposes a shift from the model of an autonomous, discrete, self-determining individuality, to an understanding of the self as comprehensible only within a tapestry of relationships, past and present, historical and contextual. In this light, the basic '""unit of study"" is not the individual as a separate entity, but as an interactional field, one that craves mutual recognition. In a parallel move, Mikhail Bakhtin offers that every utterance is a ""two-sided act;"" it is a ""territory shared,"" the product of ""the reciprocal relationship between the addresser and addressee.""  As we read, we too are read. Indeed, stories, novels and films present us with complex interactional fields in which we learn to ruminate on the subjective meanings humans attach to their behavior.  Reading fiction is one of the ways we develop intersubjective capacities, what Max Weber calls interpretive understanding or 
Verstehen
.  Fictions have much to teach us about the under-examined relational features of our own lives.  They locate readers in a shaped world where we feel the cumulative weight of things left unsaid, where we fill in the narrative gaps, where we are confronted with the dynamics of self and other, connection and rupture, perception and evaluation. This course offers a deep dive into theories of intersubjectivity and psychoanalytic writings on object relations and relational theory.  We will single out works by Max Weber, Martin Buber, Mikhail Bakhtin, D.W. Winnicott, Franz Fanon, Judith Butler, Stephen A. Mitchell, Edouard Glissant and a few others toward readings of fictions by Bechdel, Coetzee, Dostoevsky, Ishiguro, Kurtz, Morrison, Sebald, Rankine, Woolf, and films by Michael Roemer, Mike Leigh, Spike Jonz, and Lance Hammer.",Maura L Spiegel,4:10pm,6:00pm,69695,Morningside,UN3850-20183-001,FICTION AND RELATIONALITY,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/396,,40.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908213653/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3850-20183-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL UN3855,EARLY AMERICAN ECOLOGIES,"The course is a survey of the canonical texts of the Early Americas, with emphasis on how those writers experienced the natural world of their new country. Some of them had to cope with extreme cold, others with tropical heat. Some of them encountered abundance, others sparsity and famine. They all encountered new life forms – from marine life to birds, reptiles and animals. They had to cope with frequent earthquakes and hurricanes, and classify newly discovered species of vegetal life. What they saw, however, they read not only through the lenses of natural history, but also theologically and politically. For some, the natural world was rich with signs sent by God for them to interpret, for others it was a political space that they organized according to the logic either of a theocracy or the plantation. Addressing the early natural histories of the Americas, the class will also pay special attention to their politics, and investigate how the ecological spaces that the colonist encountered shaped their politics and ethics.",Branka Arsic,6:10pm,8:00pm,85279,Morningside,UN3855-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/13315,gold,3.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branka_Arsi%C4%87,https://web.archive.org///web/20180622132401/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3855-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ENGL UN3950,POETICS OF THE WARRIOR,"Prerequisites: Instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). This course of distinguished poetry about warriors and warfare goes to the intersection of disciplines, where warrior and poet together compete and excel--ingeniously, formally, passionately, consequentially--as allies in dire contest against annihilation and despair. Homer's 
Iliad
 heads our list of exemplary titles selected from ancient and classical, mediaeval and early modern sources, including, among others, Sophocles' 
Ajax
, and 
Philoctetes
; 
Beowulf
; 
Song of Roland
; 
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
; 
The Tale of the Heike
; Shakespeare's 
Henry V
; and Milton's 
Paradise Lost
. We also will read histories, memoirs, oratory, and guidebooks, from Yuzan's 
Budoshoshinshu
 to General Patton's ""The Secret of Victory,"" from Vegetius' 
De Re Militari
 to U.S. Army Field Manual (FM) 6-22. Our reading is historically broad enough to prove the range of virtues, precepts, codes and rules of martial character and action. Yet our poetry also excels in vision and in virtuosity quite apart from how it might cultivate the norms of aristeĆ­a, chivalry, or bushido, so that certain of our questions about form and style or imaginative effects might differ in kind from other questions about the closeness or disparity of the practical warrior and the poetic warrior, and the extent to which the latter elevates and inspires the former's conception of himself in times of war and peace. We shall consider how battle narratives which excel as poetry and ring true for the warrior, appealing to his wit and outlook, might replenish the aggrieved and battle-weary mind; how a war poem's beautifully formed and lucidly rendered chaos remembers and regains for him the field of action. Toward my interest in the range of possibilities for military literature as a discipline of study, I welcome not only the novice whose interest is avid but the student knowledgeable about military topics in literature, history, political and social philosophy, and especially the student, who, having served in the Armed Forces, can bring to the seminar table a contemporary military perspective and the fruits of practical wisdom.

ENGL UN3994,ROMANTICISM & FREEDOM,"“Freedom” was perhaps the central watchword of Romantic-era Britain, yet this concept remains exceedingly, notoriously difficult to pin down. Taking a cue from the sociologist and historian Orlando Patterson, who writes that “freedom is one those of values better experienced than defined,” this seminar will explore the variegated experiences of freedom (and its opposites) in the literature of British Romanticism. Romanticism unfolds alongside major revolutions in America, France, and Haiti, and we will begin by examining how the differing conceptions of freedom offered in the wake of these revolutions and their receptions galvanized writers and thinkers in Britain. From here, we will probe the expressions, possibilities, implications, and limits of freedom as outlined in various domains: political, individual, aesthetic, economic, philosophical, religious, and beyond. What does, say, Wordsworth’s claim to freedom to experiment in poetic form have to do with political and social freedom? In situating Romanticism alongside developments like revolution, the rise of globalization, and the Atlantic slave trade, we will be particularly interested in confronting how the explosion of claims to freedom in this period emerges together with and in response to the proliferation of enslaved, colonized, and otherwise constrained or hindered bodies. 
 As we read poems, novels, slave narratives, philosophical essays, political tracts, and more, a fundamental question for the course will concern the relation between seemingly oppositional terms: to what extent, and how, do notions of freedom in Romanticism depend on the necessary exclusion of the unfree? Since the Romantic age sees the birth of concepts of freedom still prevalent in our own day, this course will offer an opportunity to reflect critically on the present. To that end, we will take up some contemporary theoretical analyses and critiques of freedom, both directly in relation to Romanticism and reaching beyond.",Joseph Albernaz,4:10pm,6:00pm,27501,Morningside,UN3994-20183-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/13647,silver,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180808205342/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3994-20183-001,To be announced,,"Barnard

FILM GU4951,NEW MEDIA ART,"The rapid democratization of technology has led to a new wave of immersive storytelling that spills off screens into the real world and back again. These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape.   
 New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester we'll explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. 
 The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia‚Äôs Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings.

The course will have a primary focus on the US, but will include a global perspective.  Students will learn and apply the fundamentals of public health scientific research methods and theoretical approaches to assessing the food landscape though a public health lens. In addition, the course will cover how nutrition – at first glance a matter of individual choice – is determined by an interconnected system of socio-economic-environmental influences, and is influenced by a multitude of stakeholders engaged in policymaking processes. The course will be structured into four “themes”:  1) Why food is a public health priority, 2) Evidence, causal inference and measurement and its role in understanding and designing public health research on food, 3) The food environment, and 4) Change agents and levers: individuals, policy, and politics in food and public health.  The course will use a systems thinking approach and systems thinking tools to examine and understand the interconnectedness of the social, economic, environmental, political and economic influences and consequences that affect food and public health.  This course partially fulfills the Science Requirement as a science course for non-science majors.",Anne Paxton,1:10pm,2:25pm,68447,Morningside,UN1100-20183-001,"FOOD, PUBLIC HEALTH & POLICY",Public Health,FSPH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180626220159/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FSPH/UN1100-20183-001,To be announced,,"Barnard

GERM GU4221,20TH&21ST CENT GERM THEATER&PERF; HIST,"This course introduces students to the rich histories of modern and contemporary German-language theater and performance. The turn of the 20th century marks the emergence of modernist production styles beyond classical text-based theater, and the beginnings of the “performative turns” that were to shape avant-garde, postmodern and contemporary practices, as well as cultural theory beyond the institution of theater as such. The course familiarizes students with the analytic lens of performance studies, and deploys it to study theater and performance as part of larger cultural histories from the German Kaiserreich to the “Berlin Republic.” Both within the institutional space of the theater and beyond, 20th and 21st-century performance practices allow us to trace changing concepts of art and activism, norms and collective identities. From a comparative media studies angle, the course further underlines how theater and performance have functioned at the crossroads of different media, from the literary text (the prime enemy of much 20th-century theater and performance theory) to film and video, competitors which have become integral elements of live theater culture in the 21st century. In addition to a range of readings (theory, drama/ performance texts, reviews, etc.), we will incorporate audiovisual materials as much as possible (performance documentation where available plus related film materials).

HIST GR8906,CRFT&SCI;:OBJ&MKING; EARLY MOD,"Chandler 260 , This course studies the materials, techniques, settings, and meanings of skilled craft and artistic practices in the early modern period (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon a series of issues, including craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology; the intersections between craft and science; and questions of historical methodology and evidence in the reconstruction of historical experience. The course will be run as a “Laboratory Seminar,” with discussions of primary and secondary materials, as well as text- and object-based research and hands-on work in a laboratory. One component of the

Center for Science and Society
, this course contributes to the collaborative production of a transcription, English translation, and critical edition of a late sixteenth-century manuscript in French, 
BnF Ms. Fr. 640
. In fall 2018, the course will focus on the cultural context, materials, and techniques of “making impressions” upon a variety of surfaces, including making reliefs for ornament and for printing, and inscribing metal, including engraving and etching. Several entries in the manuscript use what we think of as “print techniques” for metal decoration or making seals and molds, and other entries discuss printers’ type, and make use of prints for image transfer. Students will begin with skill-building exercises in culinary reconstruction, pigment making, and molding, and then, with advice from a visiting “expert maker,” will choose a research focus from the entries in the manuscript that cover such topics as draftsmanship, engraving techniques, print transfer, and other topics that intersect with printing and printmaking.

HRTS GU4230,"REFUGEES, FORCED MIGR & DISPLACEMENT","Refugees, forced migration, and displacement: these subjects top the headlines of the world’s newspapers, not to mention our social media feeds. Over a million refugees have reached Europe’s shores in recent years, and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere continue to force people to flee their homes. In the aftermath of the financial crisis and 9/11, politicians in the Global North have focused on borders: who crosses them and how. Walls are being erected. Referendums are being held. We are consumed with thorny questions about who gets to join our political communities. Today there are over 65 million refugees, displaced persons, and stateless persons in the world, represented at last summer’s Olympics by their own team for first the time, a testament to their increasing visibility on the world stage. Global forced displacement recently hit a historical high. And while numbers are increasing, solutions are still elusive. The modern refugee regime, the collection of laws and institutions designed to address the problems faced by refugees, has developed slowly over the course of the last 100 years, first in response to specific crises. That regime has been shaped by a changing geopolitical landscape. At the end of the Cold War, institutions in the field expanded their mandates and preferred solutions to the “problem” of refugees changed. And yet today many scholars and policy makers argue the regime is not fit for purpose. They point to the European refugee crisis as the latest case in point. Why? What went wrong and where? Can it be fixed? This course will largely focus on the issues of forced migration, displacement and refugees related to conflict, although this subject is inevitably intertwined with larger debates about citizenship and humanitarianism. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, this course will address both scholarly and policy debates. Utilizing human rights scholarship, it will draw on work in history that charts the evolution of institutions; legal scholarship that outlines international and domestic laws; work in political science that seeks to understand responses in a comparative perspective, and anthropological studies that address how refugees understand these institutions and their experiences of exile and belonging. These topics are not only the purview of those in the academy, however.

. 
 This course will examine the tension between two contradictory trends in world politics. On the one hand, we have emerged from a century that has seen some of the most brutal practices ever perpetrated by states against their populations in the form of genocide, systematic torture, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Many of these abuses occurred after the Holocaust, even though the mantra ""never again"" was viewed by many as a pledge never to allow a repeat of these practices. Events in the new century suggest that these trends will not end anytime soon. At the same time, since the middle of the twentieth century, for the first time in human history there has been a growing global consensus that all individuals are entitled to at least some level of protection from abuse by their governments. This concept of human rights has been institutionalized through international law, diplomacy, international discourse, transnational activism, and the foreign policies of many states. Over the past two decades, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international tribunals have gone further than any institutions in human history to try to stem state abuses. This seminar will try to make sense of these contradictions.",Bruce L Cronin,10:10am,12:00pm,11841,Morningside,GU4950-20183-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,http://localhost:8801/professors/2983,,13.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180909081730/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/GU4950-20183-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

 How do Tibetan Buddhists look at religious images? What do pilgrims see when faced with sacred monuments? This seminar will explore the ubiquitous role of images and imagining in the religious traditions of Tibet. Historians of material culture argue that restricting our studies to textual sources limits our ability to understand the past experiences of the majority of people. They have developed methods and theories for ""reading"" objects to access the past. One of the most important techniques for this approach is the writing of ""object biographies,"" which will play an important role in this course. Readings and viewings will examine the painting, sculpture, architecture, and performing arts of the Tibet, placing them in the context of local religious beliefs, ritual practices, and literary canons. The seminar aims to understand how Tibetan culture produce images and materials and the ways of seeing that invest them with meaning. Classes will address specific modes of visual representation, the relationships between text and image, the social lives of images, as well as processes of reading and interpretation. Later sections will survey broader visual representations of the Himalaya, both as self-reflections and in the imagination of the western gaze.",Gray W Tuttle,2:10pm,4:00pm,25516,Morningside,GU4725-20183-001,TIBT VISUAL & MATERIAL HISTORY,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,http://localhost:8801/professors/3151,silver,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180623103854/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/GU4725-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

MDES GR5000,THEORY AND METHODS I,"This course will be the first part of a two part introduction to theoretical approaches to modern social science and cultural studies in Asian and African contexts. The first course will focus primarily on methodological and theoretical problems in the fields broadly described as historical social sciences - which study historical trends, and political, economic and social institutions and processes. The course will start with discussions regarding the origins of the modern social sciences and the disputes about the nature of social science knowledge. In the next section it will focus on definitions and debates about the concept of modernity. It will go on to analyses of some fundamental concepts used in modern social and historical analyses: concepts of social action, political concepts like state, power, hegemony, democracy, nationalism; economic concepts like the economy, labor, market, capitalism, and related concepts of secularity/secularism, representation, and identity. The teaching will be primarily through close reading of set texts, followed by a discussion. A primary concern of the course will be to think about problems specific to the societies studied by scholars of Asia and Africa: how to use a conceptual language originally stemming from reflection on European modernity in thinking about societies which have quite different historical and cultural characteristics.",Timothy Mitchell,12:10pm,2:00pm,11077,Morningside,GR5000-20183-001,,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Mitchell,https://web.archive.org///web/20180627113853/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/GR5000-20183-001/,208 Knox Hall,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,M,20183MDES5000G001,SEMINAR

We explore how colonial modernity’s abiding legacy is the institution of a way of seeing, and hence knowing, that obscures the intimacies of imperial, racial, and settler colonial projects as they produce racial, gendered, and sexual subjectivities.

The discussions will be on two levels – every week there will be a reading from the subaltern studies history, but this would be linked to thinking about some specific theoretical issue, and the historiographic difficulties of investigating the history of social groups and actors who were conventionally kept outside mainstream histories. It will track the intellectual trajectory of  subaltern studies intellectual work as it expanded , moving  from histories of the peasantry, the working class, tribals, women, lower castes, subordinate nations, to raising larger theoretical and methodological questions about critiques of nationalist history, of European history and social science to the general question of knowledge about the modern world and the languages in which it should be examined.

The course is designed to further develop fluency in oral communication, through building studentsâ€™ familiarity with a less formal register of Arabic, namely the Levantine dialect. The course will convert and recycle some of the previous Standard Arabic knowledge to the dialect, by comparing their prior knowledge to its dialectal counterpart; while at the same time developing studentsâ€™ new communicative skills in a diverse range of contexts that are essential in any conversational interaction. The course will build students abilities to interact effectively in various areas where Levantine Arabic is spoken.

MDES UN3960,HONORS THESIS SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: minimum GPA of 3.5 in MESAAS courses. 
 The MESAAS honors seminar offers students the opportunity to undertake a sustained research project under close faculty supervision. The DUS advises on general issues of project design, format, approach, general research methodologies, and timetable. In addition, students work with an individual advisor who has expertise in the area of the thesis and can advise on the specifics of method and content. The thesis will be jointly evaluated by the adviser, the DUS, and the honors thesis TA. The DUS will lead students through a variety of exercises that are directly geared to facilitating the thesis. Students build their research, interpretive, and writing skills; discuss methodological approaches; write an annotated bibliography; learn to give constructive feedback to peers and respond to feedback effectively. The final product is a polished research paper in the range of 40-60 pages. Please note: This is a one-year course that begins in the fall semester (1 point) and continues through the spring semester (3 points). Only students who have completed both semesters will receive the full 4 points of credit.",Sheldon Pollock,2:10pm,4:00pm,20565,Morningside,UN3960-20183-001,,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Pollock,https://web.archive.org///web/20180627113849/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/UN3960-20183-001/,208 Knox Hall,,"Barnard

MUSI UN2030,JEWISH MUSIC IN NEW YORK,"Prerequisites: Music Humanities (Columbia University) or An Introduction to Music (Barnard). 

With the arrival of the first Jewish immigrants in New York in the mid-1600s until today, Jewish music in the City has oscillated between preserving traditions and introducing innovative ideas. This course explores the variety of ways people have used music to describe, 
in
scribe, symbolize, and editorialize their Jewish experience. Along these lines, it draws upon genres of art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as practices that synthesize various styles and genres, from hazzanut to hiphop. Diverse musical experiences will serve as a window to address wider questions of identity, memory, and dislocation. We will also experience the Jewish soundscape of New York’s dynamic and eclectic music culture by visiting various venues and meeting key players in today’s music scene, and thus engage in the ongoing dialogues that define Jewishness in New York. A basic familiarity with Judaism and Jewish culture is helpful for this course, but it is by no means required. You do not need to know Jewish history to take this class, nor do you need to be able to read music. Translations from Hebrew and Yiddish will be provided, and musical analysis will be well explained.",Tina Fruehauf,11:40am,12:55pm,19275,Morningside,UN2030-20183-001,,Music,MUSI,http://culpa.info/professors/11809,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180419181910/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MUSI/UN2030-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

Each weekly regular class meeting is paired with a practicum, in which students will learn how to use a number of research software packages to: visualize and compare audio recordings, analyze social networks of musicians and music consumers, extract meaning from text corpora originating in online music communities, emulate old and obsolete hardware using a modern desktop computer, and access useful—but not always easy-to-access—online data sources using server-side web APIs.",Eamonn P Bell,10:10am,11:25am,26296,Morningside,UN3341-20183-001,TECHNIQUES & TOOLS FOR THE CRI,Music,MUSI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180419181955/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MUSI/UN3341-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

The Seminar is restricted to Columbia graduate students in their third or later years, and all such students are strongly encouraged to attend. No faculty (other than the organizer) will be present. Those attending the seminar will be expected to make one or more presentations of work in progress. The material for a presentation may range from a near-final draft of a chapter, to an early critical overview of an area with an outline plan for an approach to some chosen problem.

PHIL UN3840,NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ANIMAL MINDS,"Humans have a complicated relationship with other animals. We love them, befriend them and save them. We hunt, farm and eat them. We experiment on and observe them to discover more about them and to discover more about ourselves. For many of us, our pets are amongst the most familiar inhabitants of our world. Yet when we try to imagine what is going on in a dog or cat's mind--let alone that of a crow, octopus or bee--many of us are either stumped about how to go about this, or (the science strongly suggests) getting things radically wrong. Is our thought about and behavior towards animals ethically permissible, or even consistent, Can we reshape our habits of thought about animals to allow for a more rational, richer relationship with the other inhabitants of our planet? In this course, students will reflect on two closely intertwined questions: an ethical question, what sort of relationship ought we to have with animals?; and a metaphysical question, what is the nature of animal minds? Readings will primarily be be from philosophy and ethics and the cognitive sciences, with additional readings from literature and biology.  There are no prerequisites for this class--it will be helpful but certainly not necessary to have taken previous classes in philosophy(especially ethics and philosophy of mind) or in cognitive science.",Simon A Brown,12:10pm,2:00pm,78441,Morningside,UN3840-20183-001,NATURE OF ANIMAL MINDS,Philosophy,PHIL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180909150241/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHIL/UN3840-20183-001/,716 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

POLS BC3025,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES,"Political parties have evoked widespread scorn in the U.S. since the founding era; and yet, they arose almost immediately and have endured for over two centuries. In this course, we will examine why parties formed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major party.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties are, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over time as organizations, in the electorate, and in government. 
 Topics will include the presidential nomination process from the founding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season, the life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political parties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward. 
 Throughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How much is too much? We will address these difficult questions, among others, in this broad survey of American political parties.",Katherine L Krimmel,2:40pm,3:55pm,01284,Barnard College,BC3025-20183-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/13343,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180908153358/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/BC3025-20183-001,405 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,"Barnard

The second half will be more issue-based, as we will examine the resurgence of republicanism in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, in part as a critique of liberal democracy. We will explore the efforts to define ""republican"" freedom, the relationship between equality and freedom (and the challenges posed by the market and inequality in resources), the relationship between republicanism and democracy, and the role and nature of civic virtue.

POLS UN3220,LOGIC OF COLLECTIVE CHOICE,"Much of politics is about combining individual preferences or actions into collective choices. We will make use of two theoretical approaches. Our primary approach will be social choice theory, which studies how we aggregate what individuals want into what the collective “wants.” The second approach, game theory, covers how we aggregate what individuals want into what the group gets, given that social, economic, and political outcomes usually depend on the interaction of individual choices. The aggregation of preferences or choices is usually governed by some set of institutional rules, formal or informal. Our main themes include the rationality of individual and group preferences, the underpinnings and implications of using majority rule, tradeoffs between aggregation methods, the fairness of group choice, the effects of institutional constraints on choice (e.g., agenda control), and the implications for democratic choice. Most of the course material is highly abstract, but these abstract issues turn up in many real-world problems, from bargaining between the branches of government to campus elections to judicial decisions on multi-member courts to the allocation of relief funds among victims of natural disasters to the scoring of Olympic events.

Those who speak it call the language runa simi or runa shimi, ""human speech."" It was the principal language of the Inca empire and the key language of cultural interaction during the colonial era. Quechua has remained central to indigenous peoples' efforts to preserve their cultural autonomy. It has gained greater force in recent years, during which indigenous movements have swept Quechua speakers into national politics, where they have succeeded in transforming constitutions to recognize cultural diversity, making Quechua an official language of state, and successfully promoting schooling in the language. Students who satisfactorily complete Elementary Quechua I and II will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.",,9:30am,10:45am,62593,New York University,UN1101-20183-001,,Language Resource Center,QUCH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180901100353/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/QUCH/UN1101-20183-001,To be announced,,"Barnard

This includes a consideration of specific mediums, including books and other printed texts, photography, radio, television, film, and the internet. But there is also an important manner in which media technologies have to be understood not only as these cultural artifacts (radio, film) but also the more elementary senses they express (hearing, sight, etc). We therefore investigate media both as a broad conceptual category and as specific technologies of communication. 
Course texts will include a combination of theoretical works as well as case studies drawn from major religious traditions. The learning goals of the course are: (1) to introduce seminal interpretive and methodological issues in the contemporary study of media/mediation; (2) to study some theoretical classics in the field, to provide a foundation for further reading; (3) to introduce new writing in the field; and (4) to encourage students to think of ways in which the issues and authors surveyed might provide models for their own ongoing research work.",Matthew Engelke,2:10pm,4:00pm,17194,Morningside,GR6615-20183-001,,Religion,RELI,http://culpa.info/professors/13686,,2.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Engelke,https://web.archive.org///web/20180603133622/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/GR6615-20183-001/,101 80 Claremont Ave,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

RELI UN3606,RELIGION AND MEDIA IN AMERICA,"This course examines the role of media in shaping religious identities, beliefs, practices, and institutions using case studies from American history and contemporary American culture. For the purpose of this course, the term media will be interpreted broadly to mean any technique or technology designed to communicate information such as verbal discourses, written texts, visual representations, ritual gestures, sacred objects, and telecommunication technologies. In foregrounding media, we will examine how religious beliefs and practices have been remembered, disseminated, translated, and contested in the American context. Just as important, we will examine how religious groups have negotiated their American identity through media practices and their narrative content.
As we will see, acts of transmission such as writing, mapping, broadcasting, and televising play essential parts in drawing and erasing communal boundaries from both within and without. With this in mind, we will not be attempting to identify what religion is, so much as the ways in which historical actors understood themselves to be religious. We will find that what counts as religion varies, sometimes dramatically, across times, spaces, and cultures; “America” is similarly unstable and contested. Our job, then, will be to understand the role of media and mediation in constituting their contours.",Joseph A Fisher,12:10pm,2:00pm,93096,Morningside,UN3606-20183-001,,Religion,RELI,http://localhost:8801/professors/13772,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180703185637/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RELI/UN3606-20183-001,101 80 Claremont Ave,,"Barnard

SDEV UN2320,ECON & FIN MTHDS FOR SDEV,"Prerequisites: Principles of Economics and one semester of calculus. 
 The objective of this course is to introduce students to the skills and methods necessary to understand and evaluate the economic and financial aspects of sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will compare competing objectives and policies through the prism of economic & financial reasoning. Environmental economics and finance are broad areas covering all the multi-faceted and complex interactions between the economic system and the natural environment. Financial markets are the primary source of signals used to direct economic activity in a capitalist global economy. Economic activity is the primary determinant of the quality and sustainability of the natural environment. Students interested in sustainable development who are unfamiliar with economics and who do not develop a facility with economic and financial concepts are severely handicapped in their efforts to increase the level of environmental responsibility embedded in economic activity. This course is intended to provide students with a flying introduction to key analytical concepts required to understand topics in environmental economics and finance and to introduce them to selected topics within the field. The first part of the course (the Analytical Toolbox) is designed to provide a set of portable skills for two sets of students: a) those who will work in fields specifically devoted to sustainable development who, as part of their work, will need to engage with sources of economic & financial information and with discourses where sustainable development is not a focus; and b) students who may end up following careers in organizations where sustainability is not the primary objective. The topics and readings in the second part of the course were chosen to facilitate a critical engagement with the broad intellectual framework underlying sustainable development from the perspective of economics and finance. The topics are intended to create a community of intellectual discourse on sustainable development that will spill over beyond the classroom to the conversations of students and alumni that will far outlive graduation.

Students would receive instruction on methodology, group work, communication and the context of policy analysis. Much of the reading in the course would be project-specific and identified by the student research teams. Offered in Fall and Spring. For registration issues contact Cari Shimkus (

SOCI GR6100,EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: Completion of year 1 of the graduate program in Sociology. Sociology PhD students from year 2 onward only.  
 Writing research articles for journals is a lot of intellectual fun … but it’s also a rather demanding craft. This seminar prepares you for the challenge. It will help you to find an interesting question, a way to answer it, and a mode of communicating this to fellow sociologists in a way that they might find worth paying attention to. (Even) more pragmatically, the goal of this year-long seminar is to help you writing a quantitative research paper that will ultimately be suitable for presentation at a conference and submission to a journal, building valuable research and professional skills and, in many cases, providing you with a jump-start for your dissertation research. 
 As crucial milestones in the process, you will: 
 • Develop a theoretical argument that motivates hypotheses 
 • Identify a data set that can be used to test those hypotheses 
 • Format and analyze the data to draw conclusions about your hypotheses 
 • Interpret your results 
 • Present your argument and findings in a precise and compelling narrative form 
 In short, the course is partly about theory, and how it can be used to specify hypotheses and measures; partly about methods, and how data can be analyzed appropriately to test hypotheses; and partly about the craft of sociological writing, and how good writing can be used to make a clear and compelling case for your research. 
 Students entering their second year of graduate school are expected to be familiar with the main theoretical traditions in Sociology, have developed areas of substantive interest, be acquainted with the basic methodology of the social sciences, have an applied knowledge of statistical techniques, and be familiar with datasets they could possibly work with. The “Empirical seminar” is not intended to offer training in any of these areas—and this particular instructor’s capacity to provide advise on statistical techniques is rather limited indeed. Please consult with other faculty for more technical advice necessary to bring your research to fruition or make use of the statistical consulting service offered elsewhere at Columbia.",Andreas Wimmer,4:10pm,6:00pm,76842,Morningside,GR6100-20183-001,,Sociology,SOCI,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Wimmer,https://web.archive.org///web/20180419185959/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/GR6100-20183-001/,To be announced,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,M,20183SOCI6100G001,SEMINAR

The three sections of the course each examines a major stage in American race relations: slavery and segregation, the period leading up to and through the civil rights revolution, and the post-civil rights era. Emphasis is on the shifting conceptions of identity and the changing role of race and racism in the spirituals, gospel music, minstrelsy, rhythm and blues, rock ‘n’ roll, crossover soul, Hip Hop, and contemporary popular music. As we make our way toward the current moment, two related questions will loom large in the light of the historical terrain we have traversed:  to what extent do issues of economic and social inequality more than membership in racial communities increasingly determine identity and taste? And to what extent can we say that we are moving toward a “postethnic” sensibility in the musical realm, in which displays of ethnic identity coexist with  trading places, the severing of racial ownership from aesthetic genre, and the blurring of racial boundaries.",Jonathan Rieder,10:10am,11:25am,04882,Barnard College,UN3207-20183-001,,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,http://culpa.info/professors/1904,silver,15.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180613101407/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/UN3207-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

The course does not presume that students have advanced training in statistics, and any readings sections that contain mathematical or statistical content will be explained in class in nontechnical terms as needed.

SPAN GR6009,THAT MEDIEVAL IBERIAN THING,"What are the contributions and challenges of Medieval Studies to the field of Iberian Studies—and to contemporary critical thought? This challenge has frequently been invoked as 
convivencia
, a concept that roughly, albeit inadequately, translates as 
coexistence
. The term was deployed occasionally in the early twentieth century and it arose, more or less as we know it, in Ramón Menéndez Pidal's 
Orígenes del español 
(1926). There, the notion of 
convivencia
 was cast as a linguistic line of inquiry: how did different languages coexist in the same territory, and how did they interact productively? 
 
This Iberian Medieval Thing
 is a theoretical and historical meditation on contemporary forms of 
convivencia 
that transcends the coexistence of languages, religions, and cultures to address gender, race, and what David Nirenberg called 
communities of violence
. The seminar will also foster a conversation from the perspective that the 
Iberian thing
 is not something exceptional, and that it is critical to expand the context of the Iberian peninsula and its cultural production. While dealing with translations, transactions, boundaries, networks, etc., we will immediately see the importance of understanding the

 This is an umbrella course whose offerings will change each year. Some are narrow, some broad; all are designed with several objectives in common, including: a. To focus on a particular genre, playwright,  approach to live performance. b. To develop an interrelated set of conceptual, analytical, and embodiment skills and approaches. Courses typically involve  scene preparation, reading, research, and both individual and group projects, as well as active participation in classroom exercises. c. To develop a sense of the purposes and goals of a specific approach to acting. The acting lab courses are intentionally non-sequential; students with little previous background in acting are strongly encouraged to consider the Acting Workshop and Scene Lab courses. No more than six courses can be taken from the Acting Lab/Advanced Acting Lab offerings during a student's career. Auditions are required for all Acting Labs and will take place the first two evenings of each semester. Each course fulfills one course in Acting requirement for Theatre/Drama and Theatre Arts majors.

As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field.

URBS UN3450,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY DVLP,"New York City is made up of more than 400 neighborhoods. The concept of neighborhoods in cities has had many meanings and understandings over time. Equally complex is the concept of community used to describe the people attached to or defined by neighborhood. While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial, social, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community often refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers, investors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their environment. Community development is “a process where these community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems” that result from the changing contexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and approaches, residents organize themselves or work with community development practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable housing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically, develop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing markets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods, community development organizations are taking on new roles and adapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region and nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural diversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in federal policy. 
 For more than a century, city-dwellers—and especially New Yorkers—have been tackling these challenges. This course will examine both historic and contemporary community building and development efforts, paying special attention to approaches which were shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a “city of neighborhoods,” has long been a seedbed for community-based problem-solving inventions. The course will focus on the theories (why?), tools (how?), and actors (who?) within the field of community development practice and is organized around important sectors (housing, economic development, food systems, arts), case studies, and contested concepts (public participation, social capital, public space).",Mary Rocco,11:40am,12:55pm,07691,Barnard College,UN3450-20183-001,,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,http://culpa.info/professors/13554,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180620082032/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBS/UN3450-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

WMST UN3335,GENDER&WARS;:PERSPECTIVES FROM THE GLBL S,"Wars are salient features of globalization. But, how can we understand the relationship between gender and war? How do notions of masculinities and femininities operate in the organizing, waging, protesting, and commemorating war? Starting from the premise that gender is crucial to explaining what happens in national revolutionary wars, postcolonial conflicts and civil wars, peacekeeping and humanitarian interventions, and the social and personal aspects when wars come to an end; this course considers a transnational feminist analysis to reflect on the relationship between gender and militarism. It pulls together literature from different disciplinary fields to explore the gendered dimensions of wars of national liberation, armed conflicts, wartime gender based/sexual violence, politics of victimhood, anti-war activism, resistance and agency. We will pay particular attention to case studies from the global South. 
 The gendered analyses of war will be explored from a multi-disciplinary framework including history, anthropology, sociology, political science, international relations, philosophy, literature and film.

 Considers formations of gender, sexuality, and power as they circulate transnationally, as well as transnational feminist movements that have emerged to address contemporary gendered inequalities. Topics include political economy, global care chains, sexuality, sex work and trafficking, feminist politics, and human rights. , If it is a small world after all, how do forces of globalization shape and redefine both men’s and women’s positions as as workers and political subjects? And, if power swirls everywhere, how are transnational power dynamics reinscribed in gendered bodies? How is the body represented in discussions of the political economy of globalization? These questions will frame this course by highlighting how gender and power coalesce to impact the lives of individuals in various spaces including workplaces, the home, religious institutions, refugee camps, the government, and civil society, and human rights organizations. We will use specific sociological and anthropological case studies, to look at how various regimes of power operate to constrain individuals as well as give them new spaces for agency.This course will enable us to think transnationally, historically, and dynamically, using gender as a lens through which to critique relations of power and the ways that power informs our everyday lives and identities.",Elizabeth Bernstein,4:10pm,6:00pm,01330,Barnard College,UN3915-20183-001,GENDER&POWER; TRANSNATNL PERSP,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,http://culpa.info/professors/1046,,27.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20180611022738/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WMST/UN3915-20183-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

WRIT UN2311,POETRY SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 Lyric poetry in contemporary practice continues to draw upon and modify its ancient sources, as well as Renaissance, Romantic and Modernist traditions.  In this seminar, we will explore the creation of the voice of the poem, the wild lyrical I, through closely reading female poets from antiquity to present day, beginning with Anne Carson's translations of Sappho, 
If Not Winter
, all the way up to present avatars and noted sylists such as Mary Jo Bang (
Elegy
), Traci K. Smith (
Life on Mars
), Bernadette Mayer (New Directions 
Reader
), Eileen Myles (
Not Me
), Maggie Nelson (
Bluets
) and others.  The identity of the poetic speaker remains with inescapable ties to memory and experience as one mode of the lyric, and with the dramatic topes of mask and persona as another.  Students will be asked to hear a range of current and classic women poets deploying, constructing and annihilating the self: the sonnets of Queen Elizabeth and the American beginnings of Anne Bradstreet; the emergence in the 19th century of iconic and radicalizing female presences: Emily Bronte, Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Barrett Browning; and the predominance of 20th century masters who re-invented the English-language lyric as much as they inherited: Louise Bogan, Gwendolyn Brooks, H.D., Marianne Moore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Laura Riding, and Gertrude Stein.  As background, students will read prose works (epistolary, writing, journals and diaries, classic essays as well as prose poetry), which may contextualize women's desire and its reception in public and private space: the religious mysticism of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Dorothy Wordsworth's journals, Emily Dickinson's letters, and Virginia Woolf's criticism and novels.  Students will be expected to keep their own reading diary or write letters in response to class readings, as well as select a classic and contemporary female poet for semester-long research.  Additional course handouts will be organized by particular groupings of interest to our study of desire & identity, voice & witness:  Confessional poetry (Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton), Cave Canem poets (Harryette Mullen and Natasha Trethway), New York School (Alice Notley and Hannah Weiner), as well as additional contemporary poets (Lyn Melnick and Matthea Harvey).",Dorothea S Lasky,6:10pm,8:00pm,18161,Morningside,UN2311-20183-001,TRADITIONS IN POETRY,Writing,WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lasky,https://web.archive.org///web/20190115190433/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN2311-20183-001,613 Hamilton Hall,,,3,,R,20183WRIT2311W001,SEMINAR
