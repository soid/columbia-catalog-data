The exhibition highlighted a cacophony of influences, histories, and art tendencies. The wide array of artworks and approaches to art making that it put on display challenged the art world and questioned conventional thinking about art made by artists of color in the twenty-first century. Taking the Freestyle exhibition as a point of departure, this course will explore a series of questions including: How do the after-effects of displacement radically change an artists way of making art? What kind of impact have contemporary notions of diaspora, migration and exile have on the new art practices? What insights do these new practices and the objects and performances that result from them produce? We will study the visual art practices related to this trajectory and the exhibitions that contextualize them. At the same time, the course will challenge students to experiment and construct artworks from their own subjectivities in ways that intersect with the questions and concepts that arise from the investigation.",

Through a variety of reading, writing and making projects, this seminar studies the implications of our unbound and limitless death drive. Can any viable futures be located under the regimes of such imagination, futures that do not involve disposing of ourselves?

Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context.

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts. Students will have the opportunity to meet museum educators, conservators and curators through on site teaching in a variety of institutions.",

Aim of the course is to offer an alternative \u2013 more \u2018realistic\u2019 \u2013 view of ancient Greek art and understand its violence and goriness as parts of its (at least) two faces; to add, as it were, the lightless night of violence to the luminous day of the athletic, heroic, and divine realms.Violence in art will be placed in a broader political, social, historical, and intellectual context. In addition, violence in art will be understood as a powerful visual means for the construction and de-construction or even destruction of images of dangerous Otherness: the aggressive barbarian (Persians), the uncontrolled nature outside the constraints of the polis (Centaurs), and the all too powerful or independent female (Amazons).",

Especially in sculpture, artists and patrons demonstrated an unprecedented interest in subjects such as ugly old women, working peasants, slaves with disfigured bodies, or non-Greeks. The seminar will study the sculpture of the Hellenistic period as an extremely imaginative and dynamic artistic expression without the Classical bias. In addition, it will look into the societal conditions that allowed this multi-cultural and rather inclusive style in sculpture to be created. The styles of the various Hellenistic artistic centers will be individually analysed based on representative works and then compared to each other and to the sculptural traditions of the Classical period, so that Hellenistic sculpture can be understood both as a continuation of the Classical and especially Late Classical sculpture and as an artistic, intellectual, and social creation \u2013 a creation that often went against the ideals of the past.",

Classes and (if possible) collection visits will focus on medieval Christian and Islamic shrines, although student projects may cover a larger scope.  *Visits to NYC-area museums, monuments, and\/or special collections will be added if conditions permit, and assignments and schedule will change to incorporate them.",

    "course_descr":"In The Stroke of the Brush (1989), David Rosand introduced the authoriality of Titian\u2019s brushwork by discussing it in the light of contemporary painting processes, such as Willem de Kooning\u2019s Abstract Expressionism. In the exhibition Titian: Love, Desire, Death, currently at the National Gallery, London, Matthias Wivel presents the Renaissance Venetian artist as the \u201cfather of modern painting\u201d. To what extent can a Renaissance painter be modern? How can we conceptualize that modernity? Examining Titian\u2019s life and work in sixteenth century Venice in the light of sources, literature and technical data, the seminar will reconsider the paradigm of the modernity of the Renaissance master. Investigating what defined painting as \u2018modern\u2019 in Titian\u2019s own period, as well as its reception in modern time, the seminar will also discuss how the theorization of contemporary societal issues could allow us to think differently about Titian\u2019s work.  The course will be run as a seminar, with meetings devoted to discussions. Students will be responsible for the summary and introduction of the weekly readings for discussion. Each student will also be asked to carry out a research project, culminating in a class presentation and a final paper (10\/ 15 double-spaced typed pages + illustrations).",

    "course_title":"Wealth and Democracy in the United State",
    "course_descr":"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors\/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.  Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and\/or national level.  Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.  In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",

This intensive course is an advanced, interdisciplinary survey of the literature in Native American Studies that roots itself in key works that speak from that critique and history of dispossession.

    "course_descr":"In the aftermath of World War II, rebuilt (Axis) and surviving (Allied) museums presented themselves as havens from a violent world\u2013 places for quiet introspection and appreciation of modern art. As the world moved through peak decolonization of former empires in the 1970s, this concept of museums was challenged by artists who asked that the contemporary art wings of the museum be a space for active discourse about current events. In the last forty years, these trends have accelerated as community organizations focused on the contemporary museum as sites for their struggles around migrant labor (Guggenheim Abu Dhabi), reparations (British Museum), state violence (moCA Cleveland), decolonization (Brooklyn Museum), surveillance (M+ Hong Kong), arms trade (Whitney Museum), etc. On the other side, museums have also expanded staff diversity, education departments, non-profit activities, and the idea of the museum as an investor in communities.\u00a0This seminar begins from the hypothesis that this change in museums comes from tectonic shifts in the ecosystem for contemporary art in each city: museums (staff, unionized labor, curators, education departments), audiences (students, general public), organizations (community boards, local organizations, artist collectives), funders (galleries, collectors, donors, grant agencies), and media (newspapers, blogs, tiktok, twitter, instagram). We will build an ethnography of contemporary art, concluding with a case study (museum, art project, artist collective, etc) researched by each student as their final project. We will read accounts from anthropology, art history, and museum studies, interspersed with documentations of art installations.",

Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts\u2014C.L.R. James\u2019 The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Aim\u00e9 Cesair\u00e9\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi\u2019s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth\u2014this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",

Specifically, the course will address the social and cultural aspects of catastrophe by focusing on the climate crisis, its causes, and its impacts. First, the course will consider the phenomena of anthropogenic climate change. Second, the course will examine the theoretical and empirical literatures that have elucidated the nature of climate change as a social, as well as a biophysical, process. Finally, the course will consider how human rights and other legal regimes do or do not address the social justice and humanitarian issues created by anthropogenic climate change.

Whether we prefer coffee or tea, cornbread or challah, chicken breast or chicken feet, our tastes are expressive of social ties and social boundaries, and are linked to ideas of family and of foreignness. How did eating become such a profoundly cultural experience? This seminar takes an archaeological approach to two broad issues central to eating: First, what drives human food choices both today and in the past? Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies. Topics that will be covered include the nature of the first cooking, beer-brewing and feasting, writing of the early recipes, gender roles and \u2018domestic\u2019 life, and how a national cuisine takes shape. Through the course of the semester we will explore food practices from Pleistocene Spain to historic Monticello, with particular emphasis on the earliest cuisines of China, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean.",

    "course_descr":"This seminar is an introduction to the theory and methods that have been developed by anthropologists to study contemporary cities and urban cultures. Although anthropology has historically focused on the study of non-Western and largely rural societies, since the 1960s, anthropologists have increasingly directed attention to cities and urban cultures. During the course of the semester, we will examine such topics as: the politics of urban planning, development and land use; race, class, gender and urban inequality; urban migration and transnational communities; the symbolic economies of urban space; and street life. Readings will include the works of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Henri Lefebvre.",

Taking our departure from empirical and scholarly examples from Turkey, the course also resorts to a wide range of examples, from Latin American countries to the contemporary US. We will explicitly refrain from subscribing to a classical position about populist politics, aiming to go beyond discourse analysis in order to ethnographically examine how populist practices gain legitimacy and efficacy on the ground. We will be discussing the ways in which political, social, economic relations entangle with each other, specifically focusing on the Turkish case. Are the supporters of populist movements mistaken in their perception? What is the role of \u201calternative facts\u201d in establishing political legitimacy? Can experts and scientists be alternatives to populist politicians? Are the right-wing arguments embedded in the constitution of social and material worlds that liberal, progressive movements fail to question in radical ways? Ultimately, we aim to achieve an ethnographically sensitive understanding of mass politics in our contemporary moment.",

Students are challenged to examine and understand the effects of physical environment on human experience, the factors that influence architectural forms, and the role that architecture plays in shaping our behaviors and civic cultures\n \n Participants gain an understanding of architecture through slide presentations, readings, virtual visits to buildings, and discussions around observations and analyses of architecture and public spaces around the world, both iconic and lesser-known. We examine different types of buildings such as museums, churches, libraries, and transportation hubs. While the primary focus is on learning through observation and analysis, students also learn to think and imagine through hands-on, at-home model-making, using materials they should be able to find around their homes.",

Stylistic models from both the recent and ancient past have influenced how buildings look today. Likewise, social changes have shaped the way we inhabit the built environment. Understanding architecture in a historic context can enrich our experience of traveling, or of merely walking down the street where we live. It helps us connect our personal spaces and neighborhoods to places and cultures from different times, geographies, and cultures.  Participants learn to recognize and describe the formal characteristics of architecture broadly described as Classical, Medieval, Victorian, Modernist, and Postmodernist, while recognizing that few buildings are designed in a \u201cpure\u201d or exclusive idiom. We analyze historic and modern images of buildings which exemplify the most recognizable styles of each era, both in the United States and abroad. When possible, we visit New York city sites whose architecture represents or evokes one or more styles under discussion.",

They depend on multiple resources and mobilize varied technological innovations. Consequently, we will consider that making always involves making a society, for it constitutes a response to its values and a position regarding its technical and material resources.

Additionally, we look at how artificial intelligence (AI) will automate and reduce the need for human workers, as AI, Fintech, and other technologies are combined to automate many tasks.  After gaining a solid understanding of the real-world use cases of Fintech and the everyday ways it impacts the economy, social justice, and our lives, students take a journey of discovery into the world of AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin\u2019s launch in 2009, cryptocurrency and decentralized ledger technology, aka blockchain, have emerged as an economic force majeure, disrupting the fundamentals of how people interact and how they perceive money. In addition to pushing the evolution of money, blockchain technology is now poised to disrupt how we organize businesses and the future of work. Course participants explore the organizational impacts and transformations caused by blockchain and cryptocurrencies and examine what this will mean to them as future CEOs and global business and thought leaders.  The course concludes by exploring the perspective of entrepreneurs and innovators, further examining how technologies come together to form the businesses, disruptions, and methodologies of the 21st Century.

    "course_descr":"How does life work on a molecular level? Why do we succumb to disease, and how can we create new cures? This course will explore the biochemistry of life and how this knowledge can be harnessed to create new medicines. You will learn how cells convert environmental resources into energy through metabolism, how cellular molecules function, and how to use this biochemical knowledge for drug discovery related to neurodegeneration, cancer, and the current SARS-CoV-2 COVID19 pandemic. At the conclusion of the course, you will be able to diagram the major metabolic pathways and compare how these pathways are dysregulated in normal tissues in and disease states, and to design your own drug discovery program to create therapeutic for diseases such as COVID-19. In addition, you will know what techniques are used to uncover biochemical knowledge and how to design and interpret relevant experiments. You will be capable of collaborating with other people in the analysis and interpretation of biochemical data, and be able to communicate, defend and refute interpretations of data. You will learn how to create an original research proposal in the form of a research grant application. Having completed one year of college-level biology and one year of organic chemistry will be helpful to maximally benefit from this course. This course satisfies the requirement of most medical schools for introductory biochemistry, and is suitable for advanced undergraduates, and beginning graduate students; this replaces the previous UN3501 course.",

We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.  From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.  Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.  Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations.

Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).  3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.  Despite the apparent simplicity, the tactics evolved by particular virus families to survive and prosper are remarkable. This rich set of solutions to common problems in host\/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution.  The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.",

    "course_descr":"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other leading investment firms have predicted that the space economy will be worth trillions of dollars within the next few decades. In this course we explore a number of key issues having to do with the space industry and the emerging space economy with the intention of preparing participants to be leaders in those fields.  Potential topics to be covered include:  \n  \nHow private businesses are changing the new space race\n  \nWhy space commercialization will lead to a Fifth Industrial Revolution\n  \nWhat old and new financial models are enabling the growth of space technology\n  \nThe role of NASA, the Space Force, NOAA, and other government agencies\n  \nShould we be investing in space when there are so many challenges facing humanity on Earth?\n  \nHow do businesses profit from working within the space economy?\n  \nWhat does the work of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin tell us about opportunities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the moon, and Mars?\n  \nWhat steps a business must go through to be part of the new space race\n  \nHow new private and national programs will add to the complexity and vibrancy of the economy\n  \nWhat is the role of space in human rights?\n  \nHow does the improvement of communities in space lead to social and technology improvements?\n  \nWhat environmental problems can be solved using space technology?\n  \nWhat is the role of traditional financial institutions such as banks and mutual funds, and how does that compare to the role of family private offices, VCs, and hedge funds in disruptive industries like the space economy?\n \n  The course draws on fundamental concepts in business, economics, and finance and applies new concepts from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, risk management, and social impact measurements. Participants gain a foundational understanding of business development, the importance of intellectual property, and the value of community building as part of any business strategy - how solving for space is really about solving for problems on Earth. Guest speakers represent the private sector as well as groups such as NASA, the Space Force, and international space organizations.  Students leave with the tools to place an economic lens on the business, technology, and financing of spaceports, the aerospace industry, space adjacent technology, and the space economy as a whole.

Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of \u201ctruth\u201d in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.  Appropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

    "course_descr":"Each year cybercriminals steal hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of information from major companies and vital national security secrets from governments, while terrorist organizations leverage cyber-networks for distributing their media and recruiting. It is imperative to nurture the next generation of intelligence professionals to understand the cyber-threat landscape given its ubiquitous impact on our daily lives.  In this course participants are exposed to cyber-threat intelligence as a discipline and its function in providing decision-makers with the support they need to stay abreast of evolving security challenges. Case studies on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and large cybercrime networks are examined so as to better understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); their successes; and their shortcomings. Further, we look at technology\u2019s evolution and how it is integrated into our lives along with the likely future threat landscape that accompanies these technologies.  Threat intelligence encompasses more than the government, considering all private companies are reliant on technology and have their own threat intelligence teams, so this course focuses on both the public and private sectors.  Course readings cover the topics of intelligence, analysis, advanced persistent threat groups, cybercriminals, terrorist organizations, and the different methods these actors use to conduct their attacks and operations. We discuss these topics in greater depth in class lectures and with guest speakers. Students produce short white papers and work on group presentations in which they represent threat intel teams focusing on particular entities.  \nPlease note, this is not a computer science class and no technical expertise is required.",

Over the course of the semester, we will explore how Nubians and Egyptians viewed one another as well as how both Egyptians and Nubians experienced and were experienced by groups who claimed a Hellenistic or a Jewish heritage. In all of these cases, as we will see, self-definitions and cultural boundaries shifted radically according to changing power dynamics both within groups and between them.  In the course of the seminar, we will pose the following questions: How and when did groups who saw themselves as distinct from one another cooperate and intermarry? Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and\/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ. How, for instance, does what we learn from archaeology compliment or complicate understandings obtained through studies of art, literature, or documentary evidence? In our discussions and investigations this semester we will learn a great deal about Northeast Africa in antiquity \u2013 but, so too, about ethnicity, race, and power.",

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",

In turn, what imaginative possibilities did the medieval world hold for later writers? Readings will range from Ovid to Chaucer, from Malory to Kazuo Ishiguro.

    "course_title":"THE 30S: METROPOLE AND COLONY",
    "course_descr":"This course focuses on the tumultuous 1930s, which witnessed the growth of anticolonial movements, the coming to power of totalitarian and fascist regimes, and calls for internationalism and a new world vision. Even as fascism laid down its roots in parts of Europe, the struggle for independence from European colonial rule accelerated in Asia and Africa, and former subjects engaged with ideas and images about the shape of their new nations, in essays, fiction, poetry, and theater. Anti-colonialism also sparked debates about re-visioning gender relations, the place of minorities in the nation, religious difference and secularism, and models of world unity, among other issues. The course aims to consider the intersection of these debates with resistance to 1930s fascism: Did anti-fascist resistance in the metropole draw inspiration from anticolonial struggles? Conversely, did the spectre of fascism and authoritarianism present a cautionary tale to the project of nation-building in former colonies? We will read works from both the metropole and the colonies to track the crisscrossing of ideas, beginning with writers whose works foreshadowed the convulsive events of the 1930s and beyond (H.G. Wells, E.M. Forster, Rabindranath Tagore), then moving on to writers who published some of their greatest work in the 1930s (Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Mulk Raj Anand, M.K. Gandhi, Raja Rao, C.L.R. James), and concluding with an author who reassessed the events of the 1930s from a later perspective (George Lamming).  \u00a0  \nApplication Instructions: \nE-mail Professor Viswanathan (\ngv6@columbia.edu\n) with the subject heading The Thirties seminar.

    "course_descr":"Prerequisites:\u00a0\nNone.  \nEligibility: \nThis course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students.  Based on a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, the city diplomacy course is designed to offer a general introduction to the international role of cities.  With its century-old history, city diplomacy represents a relatively recent dynamics in international relations. City diplomacy is generally considered to start in 1913 with the creation, at the Universal Exposition in the Belgian city of Ghent, of the first global city network, the Union Internationale des Villes.  Since its beginning, city diplomacy emerged as a field where cities\u2019 values and idealism are implemented through a pragmatic and cooperative approach that progressively expanded its scope. The rise of such practice was driven by the desire to foster reconciliation among former enemies of the Second World War through direct interaction between residents in the framework of twinning agreements. A few years later, city diplomacy accompanied the process of decolonization by creating a solid bond of friendship between cities in former colonizing and colonized countries. In the 90s, city diplomacy widened its scope to include enhancing the city\u2019s positioning in the global economy. Today, city diplomacy is best known for its impact in addressing the main transnational challenges (including climate change, migration, violent extremism, and urbanization) through a methodology featuring horizontal partnerships with cities from all over the world and a vertical, participatory approach engaging and empowering residents and local stakeholders.  Through an innovative approach cutting cuts across the boundaries of traditional disciplines (international relations, urban sociology, area studies, history, geography), \u00a0the course will combine the emerging scholarly literature with a comparative accent linked to the analysis of primary sources from cities and international actors from all regions of the world. As a result, students will learn to connect global and regional macro-dynamics with micro-transformations at the local level, while gaining an in-depth understanding of city diplomacy's core features, management, tangible impact, and evolution.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the \nColumbia Summer in Paris Program\n\u00a0through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).&",

What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?  Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.  Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).  Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers.

    "course_descr":"Climate change is one of the world\u2019s most critical challenges, and though quite prominent in today\u2019s news it remains a complex and multifaceted issue. What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?  Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.  Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).  Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers. Students are expected and encouraged to participate in class discussions, raise questions, and contribute to small group exercises and presentations.",

This course answers these questions and many more as students explore the various strategies used by companies to communicate with the consumer. Through selected readings including marketing texts, case studies, and current news articles, students acquire a general background in marketing, advertising, and public relations.  Participants participate in lectures and discussions while also engaging in group work. Students are required to create a new product and marketing plan to present to the class as their final projects.",

    "course_descr":"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don\u2019t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds \u2014 structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works \u2014 creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",

    "course_descr":"B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University\u2019s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world\u2019s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.  This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia\u2019s RBML, Rare Books and Manuscript Library Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML\u00a0to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and students will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research.",

Care can be motivated by pain and sorrow, but also by desire and the desire for recognition. But while care is a fundamental aspect of healing, it can also be a demand that extracts obligations and liabilities. Care is an ambiguous concept that always already contains or is determined by its oppositions; we will begin by analyzing the concept of care itself, drawing on resources from the history and philosophy of medicine as well as literary sources. Ideals of care that many of us have for our loved ones are difficult to render at scale, and are often in tension with the for-profit motivations behind the development of medications, the administration of healthcare services, and the distribution of goods. We will consider the sorts of compromises that are made every day through readings in literature, history, political science and philosophy and also through first-person experience in the form of a practicum that that will run parallel to the course.",

Writing a personal essay is not only a process of self-discovery\u2014it is also the work of becoming the person capable of writing the essay.  In this course, we learn to write true stories about ourselves, the cultural artifacts and places we care about, the identities we hold in relation to power, and the ways our experiences change us forever. With the goal of producing up to three compelling personal essays, we explore the process of personal writing, from generating ideas to revising drafts. To become captivating narrators, we practice drafting skills essential to all nonfiction writing, drawing from reporting, research, and our personal archives\u2014be it text messages, photos, or journals\u2014to enhance the emotional specificity and intellectual rigor of our personal narratives.  Part seminar and part workshop, this course introduces students to the genre of personal nonfiction and the practice of critiquing writing as a group. Through close examination of their own experiences and engagement with model texts, students develop storytelling skills that will transfer to their future writing in any genre.",

In this course we will ask the question: How do authoritarian governments influence the arts, and how do artists respond? We will study how socially committed filmmakers have subverted and redefined cinema aesthetics to challenge authoritarianism and repression. In addition, we will look at how some filmmakers respond to institutional oppression, such as poverty and corruption, even within so-called \u201cfree\u201d societies. The focus is on contemporary filmmakers but will also include earlier classics of world cinema to provide historical perspective. The course will discuss these topics, among others: What is authoritarianism, what is totalitarianism, and what are the tools of repression within authoritarian\/totalitarian societies? What is Third Cinema, and how does it represent and challenge authoritarianism? How does film navigate the opposition of censorship, propaganda and truth? How do filmmakers respond to repressive laws concerning gender and sexual orientation? How do they deal with violence and trauma? How are memories of repressive regimes reflected in the psyche of modern cinema? And finally, what do we learn about authority, artistic vision, and about ourselves when we watch these films?",

We will consider how racial and ethnic differentiation as fraught but powerful processes have bolstered global labor regimes and imperial expansion projects; parsed, managed, and regulated populations; governed sexed and gendered logics of subject and social formation; and finally, opened and constrained axes of self-understanding, political organization, and social belonging. Special attention will be given to broadening students understanding of racial and ethnic differentiation beyond examinations of identity.

Although Indigenous peoples make up less than 6% of the global population, they speak more than 4,000 of the world\u2019s approximately 6,700 languages. This statistic indicates that the vast majority of the Indigenous languages are seriously endangered due to colonial practices, requiring urgent action for their maintenance and dissemination. This seminar examines the history and current state of Indigenous language revitalization in Latin America, focusing on Quechua in the Andes and the diversity of languages in the Amazon and Mesoamerica. It will approach the official and Indigenous grassroots language planning and policy initiatives.  Indigenous languages are not limited to the way Indigenous people communicate; they are an extensive and complex system of knowledge, history, memory, and identity. Therefore, this seminar will focus on how Indigenous people are reclaiming their languages, identities, and conveying their cultures through various methods and activities in rural and urban centers. These include oral traditions, educational pedagogies, music, art performances, and many other innovative efforts, for instance, using media and technological opportunities. The seminar will draw on a variety of academic literature and documentation materials produced by Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars and activists. Students will also have the opportunity to meet with Indigenous language speakers and teachers of the region. Select short films and Indigenous songs will be shown and discussed in class. This course is open to students from all departments interested in Indigenous language, culture, politics, literature, history, media, ethnomusicology, and anyone interested in expanding their critical sociocultural approach to Latin America.",

The course focuses on the fundamentals of video production: essential film grammar, story development, script, music, and sound.  Working in small groups, students shoot three shorter pieces before collaborating to make a final film. The exercises start off simply, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment.  For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production participants learn how to work in a group to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production they work together to coordinate and shoot their script. And finally in post-production they edit and polish their projects. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.  The emphasis throughout the three weeks is on collaborative teamwork. Over the course of the various exercises, each student takes on a number of different roles within the production teams (director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor, sound). For the final projects, only a handful of proposals are selected for production, so not every participant directs or writes his or her own film, though everyone plays a crucial role in the production.  On the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants. The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

The course will allow students to understand some aspects of Africa\u2019s pasts through the study of dance and bodies in motion in the cultural, stylistic, political, and aesthetic contexts in which they emerged. We will learn to appreciate some representations, meanings, and ideas of dance in precolonial Africa. We will reflect on the social meanings of dance in African contexts. The class will think about why and how African dancing bodies have inspired artists during the first half of the 20th century. We will discuss the potential of dance to articulate notions of self and ideas about national identity and \u2018African personality\u2019. We will talk about contemporary dancers from Africa.",

Monetary economics examines the relationship between real economic variables at the aggregate level and nominal variables (such as the inflation rate, nominal interest rates, nominal exchange rates, and the supply of money). Therefore, monetary economics overlaps significantly with macroeconomics.\u00a0However, students in this class learn the \"Money View\" framework as their analytical tool as\u00a0it provides a more in-depth treatment of money and central banking than is customary\n in standard macroeconomics textbooks.",

    "course_descr":"The rise in political polarization and social inequality over the past few decades has challenged the ideals that public schools were founded on nearly two centuries ago. In the past few years, we have witnessed a surge in homophobic, racist, misogynist, and xenophobic rhetoric in our society and our schools. At the same time, teachers in classrooms across this country have been engaged in the difficult work of challenging oppression and injustice in their schools, communities, and nation. These teachers know that the future of our democracy is at stake. Using a historical and sociological framework, this course examines the past and present conditions that have led to political polarization, escalating inequality, and persistent injustice. It seeks to examine the lineage of racism, sexism, nativism, and imperialism on our nation and its schools and to consider the extent to which these challenges are uniquely American or part of a more global phenomenon. It offers an introduction to the deep current of American social, political, and economic culture that many argue has produced the challenges that our nation faces today: personal and political gain marred by intolerance, derived from wealth, and rooted in the history of segregation, sexism, and exploitation. Instead of seeing these challenges as separate entities, the course acknowledges the intersectional nature of power and politics. Students will consider how these conditions affect their roles as educators and the lives of the youth and families in their schools and communities. They will leave the course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the historical and sociological antecedents that have contributed to polarization, inequity, and injustice around the globe.",

Minerals form through geological and biological processes such as igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary from high to low temperatures, from the deep interior to the Earth\u2019s surface and related to volcanism, tectonics, weathering, climate and life. Minerals are one of our most important sources of information on such processes through Earth\u2019s history. Minerals also represent important natural resources and are fundamental to the global economy and modern technology as we know it.

The Mesozoic, a \u201chot-house world\u201d, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future.

During the term-time the class will meet before the trip to prepare for it and after the trip to synthesize what was learned and to create a field guide. Subjects to be covered: Plate tectonics \/ convergent plate margins and accretionary prisms \/ Barbados geology; ice ages \/ Milankovitch cycles \/ sea level; introduction to coral reefs and fossil coral reef geology; Barbados terrestrial ecology; limestone caves \/ hydrology; dating methods; overview of Barbados history, economy, culture. In order to observe the modern day coral reef (the modern day live analog to the fossil coral reefs) the class will go snorkeling. In order to observe the effects of cave formation and water flow in limestone terrains the class will visit a cave. The class will also participate in an exercise in geological mapping of a series of coral reef terraces.  Priority is given to junior and senior majors and concentrators in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia College and the School of General Studies, and Barnard Environmental Science majors and minors. Barnard students must receive permission from the Barnard Environmental Science department chair in order to receive the subsidy. All others require the instructor's permission. Interested sophomores planning to major or concentrate in Earth Sciences or Environmental Sciences are encouraged to contact the instructor. By necessity (number of van seats) the course is limited to 20 or 21 students.",

    "course_descr":"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.  With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University\u2019s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.  Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.  Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another\u2019s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",

Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in role plays, to keep a weekly journal in which they analyze their negotiation experiences, and to participate in a final project comprising a 60 to 90-minute one-on-one negotiation and a 10 page written analysis of that negotiation.\u00a0  Because of the experiential and team-based nature of the coursework, class attendance is required. If you anticipate missing more than one class session, you should not take the course. Unanticipated absences due to illness or similar supervening circumstances will be accommodated as is reasonable; makeup activities may be required as part of the accommodation. \"",

    "course_title":"FEMINIST LIFE WRITING",
    "course_descr":"Feminists have famously claimed that \"the personal is political.\" Accordingly, life writing--in various genres--has been an important form for feminists across generations. In this class, we will explore the different ways in which feminists have used these modes to create visions of the self, to challenge the roles and self-images given to them, and to imagine new narratives. In particular, we'll explore questions of genre: so many of these writers have developed hybrid genres or challenged the boundaries of genre in order to write their lives. Looking at examples of life writing including letters, diaries and journals, graphic memoirs, and \"traditional\" autobiographies, we will examine these forms through the lens of gender, race, sexuality, class, and disability. Readings are subject to change, but may include: Audre Lorde, \nZami\n; Alison Bechdel, \nFun Home\n; Cherrie Moraga,\n Loving in the War Years\n; Maggie Nelson, \nThe Argonauts\n; Maxine Hong Kingston, \nWoman Warrior\n; poems by Adrienne Rich; Carmen Maria Machado, \nIn the Dream House\n; \nThis Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color\n; Janet Mock, \nRedefining Realness\n, and selected shorter pieces. Additionally, we will read critical and theoretical works that will urge us to consider our primary texts from various critical approaches: including sexuality studies, critical race studies, disability studies, and transgender studies.",

Hurston and Hughes navigated the demands of being an artist and representative of \"the race\" in both similar and different ways. They worked together to shape the Renaissance according to their radical visions and were friends and collaborators until they famously fell out. The goal of this class is to plot the individual and collective artistic growth and experimentation of Hurston and Hughes, as well as create a digital timeline and rendering of their individual and collaborative development. To that end, this class will use either or both of the digital tools Scalar and Timeline.js in creative and collaborative ways. The class will partner with the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard for workshops on these digital tools that will be linked to all of the course assignments and final projects.

    "course_descr":"\"Yes, globalization can produce homogeneity, but globalization is also a threat to homogeneity.\" --Kwame Anthony Appiah, \"The Case for Contamination,\" New York Times Magazine, 2006  Thinking through the arguments both in favor of and against globalization, particularly in the realm of cultural productions, in this course we will discuss the \"global\" novel. To that end, we will read essays from \nThe Global Novel: Writing the World in the 21st Century\n about works such as \nAmericanah, Snow,\n and \nThe Reluctant Fundamentalist\n (along with the novels themselves) to investigate what is meant by \"global\" and what the criteria for including novels in this categorization are. We will also consider whether there is an erasure of cultural difference and nuance in reading novels using a globalizing perspective in order to render them more approachable for a (primarily) US audience.  In order to think through and challenge this category of the global, we will also read novels that can be roughly categorized as postcolonial. We will thus consider how struggles for independence and the desire to locate one\u2019s identity either within freshly liberated nation-states or in the process of immigrating to former metropoles could give rise to cultural and psychological anxieties. We will also consider the manner in which late-stage capitalism could indeed push toward homogenized senses of self that manifest in a category such as the \"global novel\" and whether arguments could be made in favor of such homogenization. Ultimately, we will think about the politics of globalization and the desire to include in or exclude from the \u201cglobal\u201d certain locations, cultural products, or peoples.",

Reading bad romances will illuminate the consuming fantasy of the romance genre, as well as a range of emotions \u2013 rage and revenge, narcissism and self-protection, obsession and oblivion \u2013 that surface in their wake. We will also look at shifting interpretations of these powerful emotions, from Plato, to the Galenic theory of the humors, to the sociology of court-culture, to Freudian and finally contemporary neurobiological explanations of feelings. Students are welcome to propose texts of their own interests to open this course to the widest range of interests. Weekly individual tutorials with Professor Hamilton on weekends are offered but optional.  Readings: Euripides, \nMedea \nand Sophocles, \nAntigone.\n Malory, \nSir Tristram de Lyonesse\n and Shakespeare, \nOthello.\n Mme de Lafayette, \nThe Princesse de Cleves\n. Emily Bronte, \nWuthering Heights\n. Miranda July, \nThe First Bad Man\n and Curtis Sittenfield, \nPrep. \nFinally we will view Lina Wertmuller, \nSwept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August\n, Wong Kar Wai, \nIn the Mood for Love\n, and Derek Cianfrance, \nBlue Valentine\n.",

Participants learn about the formal and aesthetic properties of such works by reading, analyzing, and discussing them. We focus on the complexities of reading visual-textual interactions, that is, on understanding the grammar of comics. We also consider the status of comics and graphic novels in both the literary and arts worlds.  Participants are expected to purchase and read a number of graphic novels for the class, one in advance of the session. They have the opportunity not only to learn from the texts themselves, but also to practice short, creative exercises helping them gain a better understanding of how comics tell stories. Finally, they learn from practitioners of the medium, through several guest lectures.  This course is useful for students interested in theories and practices of storytelling in varying forms. No drawing skills are required.",

Our semester\u2019s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare\u2019s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",

By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.

    "course_descr":"The nineteenth century saw the emergence of a modern police force, the birth of detective fiction, the appearance of dastardly criminals in the boulevard theatre, and the rise of tabloid \u201ctrue crime\u201d journalism. It is also the era that scholars often identify with \u201cmodernity\u201d and the emergence of \u201cmass culture.\u201d This course will explore the convergence of these phenomena in England, France, the U.S., and the Australian subcontinent. We will examine accounts and images of nineteenth-century \u201ctrue\u201d crime, ranging from purportedly true representations to openly fictionalized ones. In addition to reading popular fiction, we will read trial reports, police memoirs, the autobiographies of those who embraced the underworld of crime, and narratives of prison life by those who saw its violence and dehumanization first-hand. We will examine a variety of nineteenth-century genres and visual media, including flip-book photographs, magic lantern shows, the \u201cfantasmagorie,\u201d the diorama and panorama, and early film. Throughout the course, our principal focus will be on primary sources: their relationship to the history they represent; their rhetorical, narrative, and visual choices and meanings; their significance for the history of crime and law.

In addition to the explicit echoes between these books, each work is interested in the relationship between the natural world and human beings; gender difference, relations between the sexes, and the reproduction of human life; and the bases of, and threats to, an ideal society. By reading these three works of art in sequence, we will thus look at how authors engage similar issues in different ways, paying particular attention to the role of of history, nation, genre, politics, literary tradition, and authorial identity. Finally, we will consider the ways in which authors\u2019 revising, refuting, and re-envisioning of \u201csource\u201d texts affects our readings of the \u201csource\u201d texts as much as the new.",

It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.\u201d Annie Dillard, The Writing Life \u201cFind a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, \u201cWhat do I know?,\u201d and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",

Beginning with readings that offer a theoretical framework and an analytical vocabulary, students will examine and discuss the way page layout, panel composition, color, lettering, sound effects, and more help carry and shape the narrative, as soundtracks and shot composition do in film. Readings will include wordless works by Shaun Tan, classic works by Alison Bechdel, as well as many that may be less familiar. Students will analyze the American, Asian, and European approaches to comics. Guest speakers from the comics industry will aid in developing students' analytical skills.

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

    "course_descr":"The class aims to provide a broad acquaintance with classic works of American literature from the period 1492-1852. The emphasis will be on literature produced before the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Most people grow up thinking of this date as the starting point of US history: \u201ca new birth of freedom,\u201d as Abraham Lincoln called it. And it was, in a way. But we will be trying to understand it differently: as an end-point of the chaotic, multinational, multicultural world that was North America before the USA existed.  Most of the texts composed during the first three centuries of American literature were written by authors who assumed that North America was destined forever to remain an outpost of the British, French, and Spanish empires. Before 1776, the Americans who most often dreamed of \u201cdeclaring independence\u201d were not white men in wigs, but rather enslaved people of African descent or members of Indigenous nations fighting to retain their sovereignty against the European empires. From these peoples\u2019 perspective, the Revolutionary War did not bring an end to the \u201ccolonial period\u201d of American history, as white Americans began telling themselves in the 1780s and 90s. According to early US nationalists like James Fenimore Cooper, America had already achieved freedom in a legal and political sense by the year 1800; now it just had to bring its culture up to speed. In reality, however, the ink on the Constitution had hardly dried before the USA became an empire in its own right. Freedom remained an unresolved problem that creators of American literature had to work through. That ongoing process, which began in the fifteenth century and continues today, is mainly what we will be studying.",

They all encountered new life forms \u2013 from marine life to birds, reptiles and animals. They had to cope with frequent earthquakes and hurricanes, and classify newly discovered species of vegetal life. What they saw, however, was read not only through the lenses of natural history, but also theologically and politically. For some, the natural world was rich with signs sent by God for them to interpret, for others it was a political space that they organized according to the a theocratic or plantation logic. The class will therefore also pay special attention to politics, and investigate how the ecological spaces that the colonists encountered shaped their politics and ethics.",

    "course_title":"FILM AND LAW",
    "course_descr":"From its beginnings, film has been preoccupied with law: in cops and robbers silent films, courtroom drama, police procedural, judge reality show, or all the scenes that fill our media-saturated world. What do films and other audio-visual media tell us about what it\u2019s like to come before the law, or about such substantive issues as what counts as murder, war crimes, torture, sexual abuse? How do films model the techniques that lawyers use to sway the passions of their audiences? How do they model the symbolism of their gestures, icons, images? If films and other audio-visual media rewrite legal events, what is their effect: on law? on legal audiences? How is the experience of being a film spectator both like and unlike the experience of being a legal subject? This course investigates such questions by looking at representations of law in film and other audio-visual media. We will seek to understand, first, how film represents law, and, second,how film attempts to shape law (influencing legal norms, intervening in legal regimes). The seminar\u2019s principal texts will be the films themselves, but we will also read relevant legal cases and film theory in order to deepen our understanding of both legal and film regimes.  *Students should email Professor Peters (peters@columbia.edu \n) the following: school, year, major, a short description of why you would like to take the class, and previous relevant classes taken.*",

    "course_descr":"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. (Seminar). As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Mahasweta Devi, Bapsi Sidwa, Rohinton Mistry, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy.

    "course_descr":"In the late seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel.\u00a0\u00a0It told the stories \u2013 not of the princes and princesses \u2013 but of ordinary people on extraordinary voyages, from villages to the Metropolis, from England to Africa and the Americas. In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century \u2013 country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.  Why does the novel appear?\u00a0\u00a0What role does it play,\u00a0in personal psychology as well as society?\u00a0 Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?\u00a0\u00a0To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.\u00a0\u00a0Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen.\u00a0Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,\n Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.\u00a0\u00a0Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",

Studying the elements of the city\u2019s well-known, and not so well-known crimes, can open a lens into the race, class, and gender structures at work in our metropolis, and reveal whom they benefit, and whom they harm. The current explosion in True Crime books, podcasts, blogs, and documentaries, and the fact that women are taking control of more of these narratives cannot be ignored. Students will choose an actual criminal case from New York\u2019s recent or not so recent history (e.g. Typhoid Mary), and write a nonfiction story driven by their point of view, which will emerge from shorter pieces and research done during the class. The coursework will cover best writing practices, such as learning the skills of legally sound, ethical reporting, interviewing people on sensitive matters, and using public records\u2014all in the interest of uncovering and shaping the raw material into a story that needs to be told, for victims who may not always have the tools to tell them. Readings will include Michelle McNamara\u2019s I\u2019ll Be Gone in The Dark, Becky Cooper\u2019s We Keep the Dead Close, James Polchin\u2019s Indecent Advances, and excerpts from Christopher Payne\u2019s photography book, North Brother Island, the Last Unknown Place in New York City. We will take virtual tours of public archives, the Museum of the City of New York, Central Park, and The East River, listen to Laci Mosley\u2019s Scam Goddess, and view documentaries and films such as Strong Island, The Witness (about Kitty Genovese), and Summer of Sam. Experts on various topics will also participate as occasional guest speakers in the class.",

Class time will consist of workshops and close readings of exemplary poems. My workshop approach focuses on developing a safe and supportive climate for feedback in which we practice how to respond in ways that respect the goals and intentions of the poet as well as how to receive feedback with an open mind and confident heart. Afternoon special sessions will also feature craft talks and readings by other award-winning contemporary poets, followed by Q&A with students. During office hours, students will receive individual poetry consultations\u2014focused on helping their poems be the poems they want them to be. At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of poems ready to submit to journals, contests, and writing programs. For those who wish to begin publishing, there will be advice on how to create effective cover letters and target submissions strategically.",

The Summer Ecosystem Experiences for Undergraduates (SEE-U) program provides an academic experience that is open to all undergraduate majors and which focuses on a global understanding of ecology and environmental sustainability. The SEE-U program gives you the opportunity to participate in a combination of lectures and labs, while conducting environmental fieldwork in unique natural settings around the world.  Perhaps the single most pressing challenge humanity faces this century is how to sustainably produce and distribute food to an ever-growing, increasingly urbanized population. Nearly two-thirds of the ecosystems of the world have been converted or are managed to provide food, fuel, and fiber for our current population of 7.2 billion people. Over 44% of land in the United States, for example, is already under cultivation; yet, over 12 million children in our country suffer from hunger and one in seven households suffer from food insecurity. By 2050, the world\u2019s population is expected to increase by 2 to 3 billion people, and there is considerable research and debate on whether we can sustainably feed humanity without jeopardizing environmental sustainability.  The SEE-U NYC program provides students an opportunity to examine agroecosystems through exploring the diverse array of farms and food systems in New York City and its surrounding environs. Lectures introduce students to the foundations of ecology and conservation, focusing on agroecosystems which include: farms, rooftop gardens, hydroponic systems, pastures, community gardens, and plantations. The course also covers food systems, or \u201cfood to fork\u201d pathways. Lectures at Columbia University with field excursions and lab exercises allow students to apply ecological concepts to real-world examples of agroecosystems. Weekly field trips include visits to farms and gardens within the city and rural farms and dairies outside of the city to expose students to the breadth of local and regional agroecosystems and food systems. Students each design and conduct their own research project as part of this course.

Microbiome refers to the collective community of microbes (e.g. bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi) and the function of their genomes. The number of studies related to microbiome has grown recently, coinciding with interest from the public and media in the potential of the microbiome to affect human health. The goal of this course is to provide background on important concepts related to microbiome and methodological issues common in epidemiological studies of microbiome. Concepts related to microbial ecology, gut biogeography, relationship with nutrition and metabolism, and how various factors including life stages affect the microbiome will be covered. The course will also focus on epidemiologic methods for gut microbiome studies including a focus on study design, implementation, and analysis along with a discussion on potential threats to causal inference. The concepts and methods learned will then be applied to various topics of microbiome and health (gastrointestinal diseases, infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes, obesity and environmental health).",

The course will take place over five 4-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will cover multiple analysis topics and will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods including descriptions of their relationship to causal inference and a discussion with examples of the types of study designs and data the methods can be used with. Following the lecture will be a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises to give them hands on experience implementing the anlytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis ans present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset).",

    "course_descr":"Most broadly, ethics is concerned with how it is best for us, as human individuals and communities, to live \u2013\u00a0how we understand and relate to ourselves, each other, and beyond. What goals or values should we pursue? What kinds of lives are good and worthy of choice (for anyone)? What moral duties do we have \u2013\u00a0are there individual actions or social policies which are (morally) required or forbidden? And to whom or what do we owe them \u2013\u00a0in virtue of what do entities have moral standing? Is acting morally good for us and, if so, would this compromise the ethical worth of so acting? What is the source of our knowledge, if any, about these matters, and how do we resolve conflicting answers to these questions?\u00a0  While attending some to \u2018meta-ethics\u2019, the course focuses on normative ethics and its application. After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics \u2013 consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly \u2018Kantianism\u2019 and \u2018contractualism\u2019), and some of the traditions of \u2018virtue ethics\u2019. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech.\u00a0  Our authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois.\u00a0  The course has three main goals for students: \n1\n) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives \u2013 historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western \u2013 on ethics; \n2\n) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct\u00a0(logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; \n3\n) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly.\u00a0  There are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",

    "course_descr":"In this course students explore fashion with a particular focus on style and culture in New York City and then develop their own designs.  Participants get a first-hand look at the field through discussion with active figures in the fashion industry such as designers, marketing directors, and stylists. They take virtual field trips to locations such as the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Readings on the history, theory, and culture of fashion include works by icons, artists, writers, editors, philosopher, and activists such as Diana Vreeland, Susan Sontag, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Rudofsky, and Marilyn Bender. As a springboard for inspiration and discussion, we view the works of a variety of designers through film clips and videos. Through our explorations into fashion as art we encounter individuals who live and enact fashion through performative dress, at times challenging social and gender expectations  Having gained a firm grounding in the field, participants research and formulate their own original fashion concepts. Based on these concepts, they design their own unique collections. Concepts may center on a particular motif (e.g., technology as an extension of the human body), period or style (e.g., British monarchy, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt, imagined future, underwater or deep space), or material inspiration (e.g., mylar, fiber optics, recyclables, etc.). While sharing sources of inspiration and research discoveries with attention to both craft and theory, in addition to producing our individual collections, we engage in a collaborative design project.",

As a screenwriter faced with such an adaptation, you must understand the idiosyncrasies of your craft well enough to recognize what to keep, what to change, and what to leave behind. This course will explore what makes a screen story work, balancing faithfulness and invention.",

These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape. New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester well explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia\u2019s Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings. It is in the interaction between these two perspectives that the course will explore the parameters of emerging frontiers in media art and the challenges these pose for existing critical vocabularies.",

    "course_descr":"Documentaries are increasingly proliferating across small and large screens around the world. They circulate as market commodities, forms of entertainment, and vehicles for social change. In this seminar we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary production, including projects created within the media industries of Mexico, Peru, India, China, Cambodia, and Israel. We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR\/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda. This course fulfills the Global Core requirement.",

What was once deemed a public value focal point has blossomed into a prudent investment strategy as research has indicated that companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainable business practices, in the long-run, outperform those that do not. The result has been a mass migration towards ESG and Impact investing.  This course is an introduction to socially responsible investing and an overview of the differences between ESG and Impact Investing. We investigate the relationships between ESG investing, outperforming market returns, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  The materials presented in class as well as class discussions empower students to answer questions such as:  \n  \nHow can investing be reconciled with sustainability and achieving the sustainable development goals?\n  \nWill ESG investing become the norm rather than the exception?\n  \nWhat are the links between green finance and ESG investing?\n \n  Through a mix of introductory finance and asset management theories, class colloquia, and investment case studies, students gain an understanding of the challenges and opportunities embedded in sustainable investing.",

Students learn about the materials and techniques that artists use as well as the historical contexts in which they operate. While we look closely at specific artworks using the tools of formal analysis, we also discuss the different methodologies art historians use to interpret the social and cultural meanings these artworks contain.The goal of this class is to examine artworks while encouraging students to think about the choices that artists make as well as how these objects reflect and embody their specific cultures and time periods. While the course proceeds chronologically, it is not a historical survey; instead, each unit is a case study of a particular moment in the history of Western art and visual culture.",

By studying some of the city's notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. Students become familiar with basic architectural vocabulary (such as light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same elements to different ends.\n \n We examine historical and current images of key buildings and places, discuss their essential role in urban life, and identify significant events which have made them memorable. We also consider how their portrayal in popular culture has contributed to New York\u2019s identity and image as an American city and a global destination.\n \n Some of the sites we consider typically include Columbia University\u2019s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9\/11 Memorial.",

We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City.

Through the study of two full-length works of literature and a number of short texts representative of different genres, periods, and styles, they will become more aware of stylistic nuances, and will be introduced to the vocabulary and methods of literary analysis. Working on the advanced grammar points covered in this course will further strengthen their mastery of French syntax. They will also be practicing writing through a variety of exercises, including pastiches and creative pieces, as well as typically French forms of academic writing such as \u201cr\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d \u201cexplication de texte,\u201d and \u201cdissertation.",

We then study how this biological organization enables some remarkable features of living systems - sensation, perception, and action - and how these features have changed over the course of evolution. Using this knowledge, we turn our focus to big questions in modern neuroscientific research, including theories of attention, memory, and consciousness. We wrap up the course with a discussion of the societal contributions - and ethical implications - of neuroscience.  Participants gain a rigorous introduction to key ideas in the field of neuroscience and a foundation with which to pursue further studies.",

This course consists of three parts.The first part (weeks 1 and 2) introduces students to public humanities and Greek history and culture, is structured around an examination of\u00a0\nSNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece\n, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).  The second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.  Throughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).  \nCourse Objectives\n: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply \nVirtual Columbia Summer Practicum in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies\n through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE). \nTuition charges apply;",

How central is the classical past in Western imagination?

    "course_descr":"B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University\u2019s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world\u2019s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.  \u00a0  This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia\u2019s RBML, Rare Books and Manuscript Library Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.  This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML\u00a0to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and stuents will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research. \u00a0This seminar inaugurates an on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with globalizing the reach and relevance of B. R. Ambedkar and to share our findings with the Columbia community and beyond.\u00a0 Working independently, students will define and pursue individual research projects.\u00a0 Working together, the class will create digital visualizations of these projects.",

    "course_descr":"The emancipation of serfs in Prussia, Habsburg monarchy and tsarist Russia (1780s to 1860s) coincided with the abolition of slavery in trans-Atlantic world. All over the globe, the acts of emancipation spurred political resistance, social movements, state actions, and economic policies that targeted former serf\/slaves and generations of their descendants. What to do with the newly granted freedom animated social movements and ruling elites, entrepreneurs and peasants, national leaders and women activists.  The abolition of serfdom and its historical significance in the particular context of eastern and central Europe is the keynote of the seminar. We will focus on pivotal issues of the post-emancipation modernity: unfree\/free labor, industrial and agrarian development; mass emigration vs. access to ethnic nationalism. We will analyze politics of class, race and ethnicity from the Enlightement to the establishment of the Communist rule. The seminar asks: what happened to people and lands they inhabited in the wake of enserfed labor? How can we historically relate the emancipation of Eastern and Central European serfs to post-emancipation societies in other parts of the modern world? The seminar welcomes students of European history and anyone, who is interested in historical studies on bondage, labor, empire, nationalism, migrations, and social and economic policies.",

We will look at the mechanisms of censorship: who served as censors? How consistently was censorship applied? How effective was censorship in suppressing unwanted expression? What were its unintended consequences? We will look at ways in which censorship triggered significant reaction, such as martyrdom or created a culture of dissimulation, such as marranism and nicodemism.\u00a0 Index, Inquisition, Star Chamber, book burnings and beheadings have been the subjects of an ever growing body of scholarship.

    "course_descr":"Even before the U.S. existed as a republic, people from 'Hispanic' and Indo-America have been incorporated into the culture, history, life, and occupational fabric of the United States. Yet, forces, figures, and factions in larger society frequently perceived Latin American heritage people as members of an 'alien' culture. Through histories of coercion, migration, labor recruitment, family networks, religious conversion, wars of occupation, economic need, political exile, education inequities, electoral participation, and unimaginative representations in film, fiction, and broader popular culture, millions of people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, and the rest of Latin America have somehow become American, while still remaining outside the national community. This 3-point undergraduate lecture course will examine the process of departure and arrival-the historical forces pushing and pulling people from Latin America to the United States. We will also examine how 'Spanish,' 'Latins,' 'Hispanics,' and 'Latinos' adjust, integrate, assimilate, resist, and adapt to the many forces that affect their lives in the U.S. over the last century and a half, creating new ethnic, racial and local identities in the process. By studying the experience of Latinos\/as and Latin American immigrants with an eye toward patterns of second-class citizenship, identity formation, ethnic culture, community maturation, labor struggles, and social mobility, we will map out the heterogeneous mosaic of Latin American and Caribbean diasporas in the U.S. Due in large part to ongoing immigration from Mexico, the Mexican-origin population has grown appreciably from approximately 100,000 at the turn of the twentieth century to thirty-five million today (10% of the overall U.S. population and about 65% of the collective Latino community). We shall therefore pay special attention to what ethnic Mexicans, their offspring, and other Americans have had to say about the Mexican American experience and its effects on Latino\/a social life as well as the nation's economy, society, and culture. Naturally, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Central\/South American communities in the United States will be examined as well. The study of Latino history is a young discipline, with many gaps and grey areas. It also exists in a complex and tense dialogue (often a monologue) within broader U.S. history.

The course will explore the idea of revolutionary ethics as conceived by Western and non-Western political philosophers and militants. The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties. Students will be exposed to different discourses of political militancy and radical politics and to reflect on the ethical implications of the history of radical thought and action in comparative perspective.",

This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current \u2018memory wars\u2019 in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa. Group(s): B, C Field(s): AFR, MEU",

    "course_descr":"Saigon and Hanoi served as competing capitals of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) in the south and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the north (1954-1975). They were symbols of warring states, one home to a fledgling republic, the other the seat of communist power. Since the late 19th century, they have also been sites of Vietnam\u2019s most dramatic transformations. As such, they occupy an important place in the historiography of modern Vietnam, not least in ongoing debates over the Indochina wars, Vietnamese nationalism, and regional difference.  \u00a0  This course examines Saigon and Hanoi as social, political, and cultural spaces, and as representations of their respective states during the war. We first consider the significance of regionalism in fashioning \u201cnew ways of being Vietnamese\u201d and examine how colonial rule reinforced those distinctions. We devote the rest of the semester to reading an array of works on the history of these cities. For the colonial period, we examine colonial urbanism, the lives of the poor, intellectuals and their ideas, as well as currents of political agitation and cultural iconoclasm. For the post-World War II period, we will focus on the distinct political cultures that took shape in the RVN and DRV. Finally, we end by looking at Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi in the post-war era, particularly after the Socialist Republic of Vietnam instituted sweeping economic reforms in the 1980s. Each week, we will discuss works social, cultural, and political history of Saigon and Hanoi, all the while keeping in mind their divergent trajectories in the three decades following World War II.",

The study of Hungarian, a language of the Finno-Ugric family, offers the opportunity to learn about the phonology of vowel harmony, the syntax of topic-comment discourse, verb agreement with subjects and objects, highly developed case systems and possessive nominal paradigms. In addition to its inflectional profile, Hungarian derivation possibilities are vast, combinatory, and playful. During the semester we will touch upon all the important grammatical aspects of Hungarian and discuss them in relation to general linguistic principles and discourse, and finally, through some text analysis, see them in action. Although the primary discussion will center on Hungarian, we will draw on comparisons to other Finno-Ugric languages, most notably Finnish and Komi; students are encouraged to draw on comparisons with their own languages of interest.

    "course_descr":"How do societies emerging from violence rebuild, and what mechanisms do they employ to punish past perpetrators, to come to terms with difficult pasts, to acknowledge the suffering of victims, and to try to nurture democratic processes that will prevent future violence? This course examines the ways in which societies have addressed the questions of accountability and the challenge of \u201cdealing with the past\u201d in the aftermath of political transition and violent conflict that have marked the last half century. In particular, we will examine the discourse around \u201chistorical wrongs,\u201d and attempts\u2014international, national, local\u2014to address such wrongs. The historical context for this exploration is the development, following the defeat of Nazi Germany, of principles, norms and institutions regarding responsibility to memory, universal human rights, and the idea that genocide can and should be prevented. This course will thus begin with an exploration of the Holocaust in memory and history, and an exploration of the post-World War II period as a watershed moment in the development of a discourse around historical justice and the intersection of history, memory and trauma.  The establishment of a new framework for a discourse around history and \u201cdealing with the past\u201d requires an investigation of what it means for a state or a community to take responsibility for its actions, and what repair and prevention look like in post-conflict societies. Much of the course will be devoted to the examination of a series of case studies that coming from the Holocaust, World War II, the fall of communism, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, and the Civil Rights movement in the United States. The question of how societies can address historical wrongs is a question that ultimately requires us to consider the relationship between history, memory, trauma and justice. Why does the past matter? Does the pursuit of justice limit, or compromise, the work that historians are expected to do? What new ways of thinking about history have emerged in the period we are examining (we can think about testimony, museums, sites, literature to name just a few)? In exploring these questions, this course seeks to understand what is necessary for societies to deal with violent pasts, and the success and limitations that the discourse and practice of historical justice suggests when it comes to questions of prevention and repair.",

    "course_descr":"Equivalent to MUSI F1123 and C1123. Part of the Core Curriculum since 1947, Music Humanities aims to instill in students a basic comprehension of the many forms of the Western musical imagination. Its specific goals are to awaken and encourage in students an appreciation of music in the Western world, to help them learn to respond intelligently to a variety of musical idioms, and to engage them in the various debates about the character and purposes of music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since ancient times. The course attempts to involve students actively in the process of critical listening, both in the classroom and in concerts that the students attend and write about. The extraordinary richness of musical life in New York is thus an integral part of the course. Although not a history of Western music, the course is taught in a chronological format and includes masterpieces by Josquin des Prez, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, among others. No previous knowledge of music required. Columbia University undergraduates who need this course for graduation are encouraged to register during early registration.",

Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II. However, recent rises in authoritarianism and anti-liberal regimes have raised new questions on whether the human rights framework is still capable of addressing injustices in the modern world. This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.\n \n In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.\n \n In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.\n \n Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities. The primary assignment for this course is participation in an international moot court activity, which challenges students to research and give oral arguments on a fictitious human rights case.\n \n The course also introduces students to several different perspectives through a variety of guest lecturers.",

Course assignments stress observation while focusing on experiments with materials so as to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition, use of charcoal and pencil, graphic\u00a0drawing\u00a0techniques, wet media, color theory, and optical illusions.  The course combines studio work, including the study of the human figure using live nude models, with outdoor drawing, individual and group critiques, and visits to major museums and art galleries. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week in the form of a short seminar, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.  Participants also learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications, and the session concludes with a group show to which parents, friends, and other program participants are invited.",

    "course_descr":"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker\u2019s Sundance feature film,\u00a0\nTangerine\n, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary,\u00a0\nSearching for Sugar Man\n, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.  Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.  In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones\/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, sound \u2013 so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.  In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools\/career paths.  On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.  Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",

The entire course and assignments will focus on working with a client to assess the environment, create a prioritized business case, and conclude with an implementation plan. Topics will include whole systems development, strategies for engagement, diagnosis to discovery, ethics and managing your consulting relationship, change management, and establishing yourself as a trusted advisor.  \u00a0  This is a hands-on course where students are expected to identify an existing consulting assignment (internal or external) that we will work throughout the class to help their client improve its effectiveness and competitiveness.

For example, realtor COMPASS, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and electric cooperatives are all leveraging networks. The ideas of \u201copen\u201d and \u201ccollective\u201d are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.  \u00a0  \u201cNetworked Work\u201d presents the structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:  \u00a0  \n  \nsocial networks\n  \ncommunities of practice (or knowledge-networks),\n  \nopen source,\n  \nopen data, and\n  \nopen innovation.\n \n  \u00a0  Students will envision, diagnose and design networks for \u201ccooperative advantage.\u201d We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, social influence, sustainability challenges, and technology advancement.",

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

There are also ways to constructively engage in conflict that lead to better quality outcomes and relationships. In this course, students learn basic concepts about conflict resolution so that they can develop a deeper and broader understanding of conflict dynamics. There are many types of conflicts and in this course the students focus on learning more about their interpersonal conflicts with others. They learn skills so they will be able to more constructively resolve their interpersonal conflicts toward win-win outcomes.  These goals are achieved by students developing more self-awareness as to the types of conflict styles they tend to use as their \u201cdefault\u201d approach. They become more aware of their \u201chot buttons\u201d and the types of behaviors and situations that cause them to become embroiled in a conflict situation. In addition to learning more about their own habits, they apply these concepts and skills to better understand others around them. By developing more empathy and understanding of others, students are able to reduce the number, types, and intensity of their interpersonal conflicts.  The course is primarily experiential and interactive so students learn by doing and reinforce their learning through immediate application. There are role-plays, simulations, discussions, presentations, film analyses, and other activities designed to enhance learning of the identified concepts and skills.",

    "course_descr":"Conflict is a part of life. Most people do not like conflict because they usually do not resolve their conflicts well and so they develop a distaste for it. There are also ways to constructively engage in conflict that lead to better quality outcomes and relationships. In this course, students learn basic concepts about conflict resolution so that they can develop a deeper and broader understanding of conflict dynamics. There are many types of conflicts and in this course the students focus on learning more about their interpersonal conflicts with others. They learn skills so they will be able to more constructively resolve their interpersonal conflicts toward win-win outcomes.  These goals are achieved by students developing more self-awareness as to the types of conflict styles they tend to use as their \u201cdefault\u201d approach. They become more aware of their \u201chot buttons\u201d and the types of behaviors and situations that cause them to become embroiled in a conflict situation. In addition to learning more about their own habits, they apply these concepts and skills to better understand others around them. By developing more empathy and understanding of others, students are able to reduce the number, types, and intensity of their interpersonal conflicts.  The course is primarily experiential and interactive so students learn by doing and reinforce their learning through immediate application. There are role-plays, simulations, discussions, presentations, film analyses, and other activities designed to enhance learning of the identified concepts and skills.",

They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.\n \n Students begin by learning the elements of digital filmmaking with video exercises that start off simply at first, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment until they advance to a final film project.\n \n For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts.\n \n Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other\u2019s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.\n \n The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

Special attention is paid to the three key components of trial law: the attorney as advocate, the judge as the gatekeeper of the evidence, and the role of the jury as the ultimate fact finder.  Students prepare a case, complete with witnesses and exhibits, through final trial before a jury. Through daily classroom exercises, they learn how to present and cross-examine witnesses, introduce exhibits into evidence, and develop trial strategy to effectively argue their positions to a jury.

    "course_descr":"Social and political change can be powered by protest and coordinated acts of civil dissent. In modern American life, it is easier than ever to share information and rally supporters to a cause, but the propulsive force of protest movements happens in the streets. In an age when lies and conspiracy theories can outpace the truth and protesters, counter protesters, and law enforcement all view the press with skepticism, how can journalists verify, interrogate, and report on what is happening while also remaining safe and keeping their sources safe? What does it mean to report on a protest objectively? And should that even be a goal?\u00a0  This course offers an overview and critical examination of journalistic coverage of protest and civil dissent over the last sixty years. It explores specific selections of protest reporting in a range of media formats, including photography and video journalism, audio news, investigative longform, and personal essays, as well as considers the ethical considerations, risks, and challenges that journalists navigate as they cover individual protests and protest movements writ large.\u00a0\u00a0  Over the course of the semester, students will learn the fundamentals of modern journalistic practice as well as analyze the origins and purposes of protest reporting. We will examine the challenges the practice of civil dissent journalism faces in the present day and discuss how journalism shapes public discourse around activism, protests, and other forms of political dissent.  The course is intended for students with a deep interest in activism, civil dissent, political unrest, and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners of the craft. It aims to promote skepticism of official narratives and improve critical thinking about how protest movements are covered by journalists.",

There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war. The examination of risks to journalists on conflict beats will include detailed case studies of real kidnappings and battlefield deaths, and study examples of risk mitigation and best practices in the field. The course is intended for students with a deep interest in war, terrorism and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners.

Each class meeting will include a complete screening of an Israeli feature film, as well as clips of related works. Readings will include critical essays and histories which elaborate on in-class screenings and cover additional topics and films. Written assignments will be three analytical essays which will encourage critical thinking, close analysis of films, and independent research beyond the materials presented in class.  All readings are in English. All feature films and film clips are in Hebrew (some include Arabic), and will be presented with English subtitles. Students fluent in Hebrew and Arabic are encouraged to interpret the dialogue for additional meaning that may not be translated in the subtitles.",

Classes will be held twice a week for three weeks. Each 2.5 hour class will address one major subject area. The course will include 2-3 guest speakers and 1-2 structured policy debates or simulation games. In order to gain a deeper appreciation of the real world challenges facing Israeli decision-makers, students will draft policy papers on two of the primary subjects discussed.",

If not, then how can we know that this is not the case \u2013 what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge \u2013 what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference \u2013 would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways \u2013 if we actually are living in the Matrix?  In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato\u2019s\u00a0\nRepublic\n\u00a0and Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019\u00a0\nMeditations\n, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.  This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students\u2019 abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.  Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",

Then we explore the components of language (phonemes, morphemes, words, and sentences) and how each plays a role in what we hear as an \u201caccent\u201d or dialect.

The reading group will draw from the expertise of professors and outside facilitators to lead discussions on a specific topic each week. Students will leave the group with an understanding of (1) policies behind each of the proposed issues; (2) practical issues to be considered when addressing the topics; and (3) theoretical approach of the topics. Students will be engaged to consider the different approaches to address and to think critically about the issues when they arise in an international arbitration context. Methodologically, the course will make use of readings and cases that concern each of the topics.",

Beginning with an introduction to the courts, legal system, and Constitution of the United States, the course provides students with a foundation for a detailed examination of the structure, policies, interpretation, and application of criminal law.  We delve into a variety of topics, from the basic elements of crimes such as homicide, robbery, and assault, to inchoate crimes like attempt and conspiracy, to crimes against property. Students evaluate the fairness and morality of punishments, including the death penalty, and analyze and apply legal defenses.

Students evaluate the fairness and morality of punishments, including the death penalty, and analyze and apply legal defenses.  Participants also learn to recognize the primary sources of criminal law in the US, and probe the boundaries of statutory law as imposed by state and federal constitutions. Students write legal briefs of landmark court cases and prepare and deliver courtroom-style legal arguments in a mock trial exercise. All of these issues are explored against the broader backdrop of race and socio-economic class in America.  The course provides an opportunity for students to gain academic skills for high school and beyond. Sophisticated legal readings sharpen their text analysis, critical thinking, and reading comprehension abilities. Participants burnish their oral communication, argument, and debate skills through case law discussions and mock trial activities.",

In the process, they gain insight into whether a career in law would be fulfilling to them.  At the heart of the course is exposure to the real world of legal practice. Through presentations by attorneys representing a broad range of practice areas and through visits to law firms, courts (including Manhattan\u2019s Criminal Court, inspiration for television\u2019s\u00a0\nLaw and Order\n), and public interest legal organizations, participants learn first-hand about law as it is practiced in the corporate, government, and non-profit sectors.  The course teacher provides substantive instruction related to first-year law school courses as well as LSAT test prep information and gives students a clear view of the requirements for law school and attorney licensing in the United States.  Participants gain public speaking experience through debate, mock trial, and moot court exercises and engage in fundamental legal research and writing assignments, thereby developing skills which are transferable across academic disciplines.  Students engage in a number of exercises requiring application of the principles and concepts learned throughout the program. A culminating collaborative practicum project is a special opportunity for them to employ their knowledge so as to develop and present a law-based solution to a specific social issue of interest to them.",

Next, we look at language variation (in the form of accents, dialect, and slang) and imposed linguistic policies (such as spelling) that manipulate our native abilities to communicate. We move onto pragmatics, the study of how language use varies based on context, audience, formality, speaker intentionality, and even gender identity. Next, we explore language taboos (curse words, censorship) and language prestige (the social value placed on different speaking styles). We finish with an analysis of the Internet's impact on language (memes, texting, the possible decline of \"proper\" English, and the limitations of AI communication).\n \n Students work in the morning with texts, lectures, and films, covering the principles of linguistics and the relevant literature. In the afternoon, they problem-solve by working through case studies and analyzing linguistic evidence via databases and other web resources. Guest speakers who are active in their fields add a level of detail and specificity to the course.\n \n Participants gain a deeper understanding of the role of language in their society and linguistics as an interdisciplinary tool for greater insight into how we live.",

    "course_descr":"Of the world\u2019s estimated 7,000 languages \u2013 representing migrations and historical developments thousands of years old \u2013 the majority are oral, little-documented, and increasingly endangered under the onslaught of global languages like English. This course will take the unprecedented, paradoxical linguistic capital of New York City as a lens for examining how immigrants form communities in a new land, how those communities are integrated into the wider society, and how they grapple with linguistic and cultural loss. Interdisciplinary with an experiential learning component, the course will focus on texts, materials, encounters, and fieldwork with three of the city\u2019s newest and least-studied indigenous immigrant communities (indigenous Latin Americans, Himalayans, and Central Asians).Indigeneity, though often invisible or perceived as marginal in global cities like New York, is in fact pervasive and fundamental. Cities now constitute a crucial site for understanding migration and cultural change, with language a vehicle for culture. Studying cultures only in situ (i.e. in their homelands) risks missing a crucial dimension. Students will be immersed in stateless, oral, immigrant cultures while also gaining a hands-on critical understanding of language endangerment and urban sociolinguistic research, first through field experiences and guest speakers (Endangered Language Alliance partners) and then by going out together into communities to work on projects in small teams. The Endangered Language Alliance (ELA), where the instructor is Co-Director, was formed as a non-profit research institute in 2010 as a forum for researchers, community members, activists, artists, and other New Yorkers to come together to support indigenous and minority languages. ELA\u2019s video recordings provide first-hand testimony of endangered languages in the global city \u2013 in indigenous languages with English translation \u2013 available in few other places. Those texts will be central to this course, supplemented by the new,first-ever, detailed language map of New York City being produced by ELA.",

Areas covered include the following:  \n  \nGraph theory, a topic heavily developed by both mathematicians and computer scientists. We explore algorithmic ways to compute, for example, the optimal path between two points on a map (minimizing cost, time, or another parameter). Another application is minimizing the cost of an electrical network which has to provide power to all residents in a new neighborhood.\n  \nProbability and its numerous applications. We look at how probabilities are applied in economics and in popular media, and examine how they can sometimes be counter-intuitive or even deceptive.\n  \nVarious counting methods, combinatorics, and examples of Nash equilibria. We study applications of these techniques in economics (the prisoner's dilemma), computer science (assessing the complexity of an algorithm), finance (loans and investments), and biology (population growth).\n \n  Students work individually and in groups to find creative solutions to given problems.

    "course_descr":"In this course intended for students who enjoy mathematics and logical reasoning, participants explore innovative ways in which math is used in the real world, in fields such as economics, computer science, media, and the physical sciences. By engaging with challenging practical problems, students hone their independent thinking and problem-solving skills.  Areas covered include the following:  \n  \nGraph theory, a topic heavily developed by both mathematicians and computer scientists. We explore algorithmic ways to compute, for example, the optimal path between two points on a map (minimizing cost, time, or another parameter). Another application is minimizing the cost of an electrical network which has to provide power to all residents in a new neighborhood.\n  \nProbability and its numerous applications. We look at how probabilities are applied in economics and in popular media, and examine how they can sometimes be counter-intuitive or even deceptive.\n  \nVarious counting methods, combinatorics, and examples of Nash equilibria. We study applications of these techniques in economics (the prisoner's dilemma), computer science (assessing the complexity of an algorithm), finance (loans and investments), and biology (population growth).\n \n  Students work individually and in groups to find creative solutions to given problems. Each student also works on a project of his or her own choosing, on a topic about which he or she is passionate.",

The course will convert and recycle some of the previous Standard Arabic knowledge to the dialect, by comparing their prior knowledge to its dialectal counterpart; while at the same time developing students\u2019 new communicative skills in a diverse range of contexts that are essential in any conversational interaction. The course will build students abilities to interact effectively in various areas where Levantine Arabic is spoken. In addition to varied thematic topics, the course exposes students to cultural aspects specific to the region. Additionally, the course will work on both constructing students\u2019 knowledge of dialectal diction as well as other grammatical features of the dialects.

The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the \u201cGlobal Core.\u201d The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world\u2014where the false binaries of \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe Rest\u201d no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",

    "course_descr":"This colloquium is a course on many influential texts of literature from Ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Sumerian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Canaanite, and others. The emphasis is on investigating the literary traditions of each culture \u2013 the subject matter, form, methods, and symbolism\u2013 that distinguish them from one another and from later traditions of the Middle East. The course is not\n a \u201ccivilization\u201d course, nor is it a history class, although elements of culture and history will be mentioned as necessary. The course is intended to provide a facility with, and an awareness of, the content and context of ancient works of literature in translation from the Ancient Middle East.  \n Students in this course will gain a familiarity with the major cultures of the Ancient Middle East, the best known and most remarked upon stories, and the legacy of those works on some later traditions. The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.  \n All assigned readings for the course will be in English. The course meets once a week and sessions are two hours long.",

Through case studies of Beirut (1975-present), Baghdad (2003-present), Cairo (2011-present), Diyarbakir (1914-present), Aleppo (1914-present), and Jerusalem (1914-present), this course traces how urban life adjusted to destruction (and post-conflict reconstruction), violence, and anarchy; how neighborhoods were reshaped; and how local ethnic, religious, and political dynamics played out in these cities and metropolises. Relying on multi-disciplinary and post-disciplinary scholarship, and employing a wealth of audiovisual material, literary works, and interviews conducted by the instructor, the course scrutinizes how conflicts have impacted urban life in the Middle East, and how civilians react to, confront, and resist militarization in urban spaces.",

    "course_descr":"This course explores a broad range of questions concerning the relationship between the media and politics, with a focus on historical and contemporary issues presented in the American context: Do the news media educate or manipulate the citizenry? What is the role of the press in a democracy and how does the First Amendment protect the press in the United States? What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing \u201cweaponization\u201d of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America\u2019s system of democratic government.  Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",

    "course_descr":"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.  We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.  Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",

    "course_title":"Global Migration & Personal Identity",
    "course_descr":"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one\u2019s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.  This course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?  Participants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies\u2014and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.  We approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines\/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.  Outside of class, students read articles on migration theory as well as various case studies, including life stories of young migrants in Europe, accounts of the border crisis in the US, and testimonies from DACA recipients.

    "course_descr":"Chemistry, the central science, is the science of molecules and bonds. Its signature is change in all its manifestations, from events that happen on a geological time scale to those that happen instantaneously, from the cosmological to the subatomic scale. Chemistry provides powerful scientific tools that extend our ability to sense the magnitudes of change by stretching the limits of what we know of our universe.  Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry is designed for highly motivated students who want to strengthen their understanding of chemistry and current research methods. The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a presentation by senior faculty members and researchers that is expanded upon through small group discussions and laboratory experiences.  Topics have been selected because they stand out as essential themes of current research, illustrate the methods of science, lend themselves to historical development, and highlight the role of chemistry as the central science. Through integrative experiments and collaborative projects, students discover the synthetic and analytic dimensions of chemistry in forensic, environmental, and materials problems. Experiments emphasize the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills.  Formal training includes instrumental methods in spectroscopy, chromatography, magnetic resonance, and computer simulations with state-of-the-art equipment in the department\u2019s modern laboratories. Guest lecturers and field trips to area research facilities round out the program. Students are expected to complete a small research project, prepare a scientific paper, and participate regularly in class discussions.",

    "course_descr":"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials\u2014the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today\u2019s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures\u2014bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures\u2014light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.  In this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.  Students investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia\u2019s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",

Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?  This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.  Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers \u2013 i.e. export (supply\/origin) and import (demand\/destination) hubs \u2013 along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.  Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources \u2013 including those that are sustainable \u2013 and their effect in the global landscape.  Students gain an understanding of \u2013 and think critically about \u2013 various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates\/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",

What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?  This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.  Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers \u2013 i.e. export (supply\/origin) and import (demand\/destination) hubs \u2013 along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.  Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources \u2013 including those that are sustainable \u2013 and their effect in the global landscape.  Students gain an understanding of \u2013 and think critically about \u2013 various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates\/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",

Modern neuroscience has made great strides toward understanding how our experiences shape our brains, and how changes in our brains impact behavior.  In this course we explore how our experiences shape who we are, what kinds of changes in the brain are thought to underlie learning and memory, and how learning and memory can contribute to the development of mental health problems such as addiction, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Topics to be covered include types of learning and memory, disorders such as amnesias and dementias, an introduction to the cellular and molecular basis of memory formation, and an in-depth examination about how these processes can contribute to mental health problems. We conclude the course with an overview of innovative treatments under development for various disorders, and how learning and memory might play a role in their therapeutic effects. Topics are approached through lecture, group discussion, short videos, interactive web-based activities, and readings.

    "course_descr":"A multitude of approaches guide the practitioner when faced with a problem. In conflict resolution, these approaches stem from a range of disciplines, whether from psychology, social psychology, political science, international relations, clinical psychology or even from quantum theory and the latest advances in neuroscience. From this palette of theories, frameworks, and models, the avid and adequately equipped practitioner is able to engage with the conflicts arising from various situations. Ideally, he\/she is able to prevent, reduce, mitigate or to de-escalate the conflict to such a degree that actors are able to constructively engage in handling their issues. The competence to understand the drivers and triggers of conflict, and the motives that actors have to engage in conflict is derived from the practitioner\u2019s capacity and capability to be flexible, adaptable, and critical in deploying the knowledge and tools appropriate to resolve any conflict, whether international, communal, organizational or interpersonal.  Using a combination of analysis and case studies, this course explores the intersection of theory and analysis, covering the various concepts and frameworks available in the field and applying them to current situations. The critical engagement with the discipline allows students to improve their critical thinking skills, asking a range of questions to appraise the validity of each introduced concept and model, thereby reflecting proactively on whether or not a theory is useful and applicable in explaining the myriad phenomena emerging from a conflict. Knowing when a theory is advantageous to allow for the investigation into what drives, triggers, and motivates the behaviors, attitudes, or emotions of conflict parties immerses students into the reality and practicality of dealing with complex issues and the pitfalls of making recommendations short of viable entry points for leveraging peace and bringing a potentially protracted conflict to a different pathway. The acquired competences are applicable not only towards the program, but also beyond the program as students will be empowered to reflect critically on a text, understand the internal and external validity of a theory, circumvent logical errors, focus on concise and cohesive line of argumentation, and apply results-based recommendations. These skills and competences are applicable to any position requiring analytical, writing, and presentation skills.  This course builds on and expands the learnings from PS5101. It is a core course, allo",

In today\u2019s environment of rapidly increasing transparency combined with the growth of the nonprofit sector, it is critical for nonprofit managers to understand how to lead and govern effectively. This Nonprofit Governance course is designed to prepare students to develop, manage, and work effectively with governing boards of directors and trustees, all of whom have the shared goal of meeting the mission of an organization. Topics include: (1) the work of the board, including legal, ethical and fiduciary oversight; strategic thinking and planning; ensuring resources; (2) the stakeholders involved in governance of an organization, including the board (composition and structure) and shared leadership with other staff and management; and (3) board culture, including board development, board dynamics, meetings, and board engagement.",

Course participants share their writing in a workshop setting and receive in-depth feedback from both their peers and the instructor. By the end of the three weeks, they will have completed an original outline and the first three chapters of their novel. They leave with a greater understanding of what it means to craft a long-form work of fiction\u2014and having become stronger and more confident in their overall writing skills.  \nCourses in creative writing are offered in conjunction with the Writing Program at Columbia University\u2019s School of the Arts. Overseen by Chair of Creative Writing Timothy Donnelly, Professor Alan Ziegler, and Director of Creative Writing for Pre-College Programs Christina Rumpf, the creative writing courses are designed to challenge and engage students interested in literary creation, providing them with a substantial foundation for further exploration of their creative work.",

    "course_descr":"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.  The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.  Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?  Some of the topics that may be addressed include the\u00a0\nFrye and Daubert\n\u00a0standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.  The course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",

    "course_descr":"An experiential, immersive course designed for students interested in the urban environment, culture, literature, history, and public policy. The course comprises four interconnected modules (see below). Two days each week are reserved for fieldwork in New York City with city policymakers, philanthropists, and artists.\n \n \nNew York City: A History of People, Politics, and Place\n What is New York City\u2019s relationship to the American Dream? How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the other aspects in the course. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.\n \n \nWriting the City\n How is our experience of New York \u2013 the city\u2019s projected image and self-image \u2013 shaped by literature about the city? Using short stories, poems, popular song, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon. Beyond this examination, writing in the field enables students to reflect upon their experiences in the city and acts to tie the various threads of the course together while remaining true to the singular experience of each course participant.\n \n \nUrban Place Design\n What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city? We study various answers to this question \u2013 public\/private partnerships (e.g. Bryant Park), the NYC Department of Transportation Plaza Program, public parks (e.g. Central Park), privately-owned public spaces, and business improvement districts \u2013 in order to learn the fundamental dynamics of public space in New York City. Armed with that knowledge, we select a location and design our own proposals for public spaces. We also examine how previous urban designers, such as Robert Moses, sought to overcome the challenges faced in constructing (and reconstructing) the city \u2013 and how those solutions often have ramifications for today\u2019s NYC. Fieldwork: visiting and evaluating public plazas, meeting with designers and policymakers at the NY Department of Transportation, Neighborhood Plaza Partnership, and Times Square Alliance.  \nEmerging Urban Issues\n Course instructors and invited experts intr",

    "course_descr":"Oral history practitioners understand the critical importance of attentive and active listening during the interview. Even after the recording has ended, listening to the interview is equally vital: in transcribing, archiving, interpreting, curating, and presenting. Thus, this course takes listening to be central to modes of inquiry and amplification, and the oral history interview as both an object to be queried and subject that queries. We will reflect upon how oral histories serve as both primary and secondary sources, and challenge historical inquiry even while uniquely enabling new insights into the past. To do so, the distinguishing features of oral histories--as document, text, medium, dialogue, and publication--will serve as the thematic framework for our reading of key practitioner theorists alongside applied listening to sample oral histories. Drawing on the instructor\u2019s experiences in directing oral history-based public history initiatives, throughout the course we will consider the public life of oral histories beyond the interview--as archive, publication, podcast, and exhibition. In so doing, we will look to understand the role of oral historians as both documentarians and co-creators with their narrators of historical knowledge about the past and present.",

We ask of each form: What lines are marked by conventions of genre, and how do those compare to lines drawn by the ethics of oral history? How can we draw on narrative and performance in our own creative and scholarly contributions to oral history?  \u00a0  This class will be a space for experimentation and serious play, where students will discuss questions raised by the work of others, and grapple with those questions by making their own creative work. Pedagogically, we will simultaneously explore two areas of creation: oral history on the page, and oral history in performance. Students will make new work and engage in discussion about existing work. Class time will be spent discussing texts, workshopping students\u2019 creative projects, and participating in activities designed to prompt collaboration and engineered to inspire new work. Over the course of the semester students will write, perform, and create prompts inspired by oral history.",

This course is taught in French.  \nEligibility: \nThis course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students  This undergraduate course aims to unveil a lesser known face of Paris linked to its colonial past in order to reread the present social, political and cultural landscape of France's capital city. By visiting hotspots of a forgotten Parisian black history, students will learn about the legacy of a colonial past often unknown and neglected. Sites will include the Latin Quarter which saw the birth of Negritude movement in the 1930s with the encounter of African and Caribbean intellectuals (Cesaire, Senghor, Damas) and the foundation of the editions Presence Africaine with Alioune Diop; Saint Germain des Pres and Pigalle which celebrated jazz music in cabarets; the Museum of the history of immigration in Porte Doree and the Musee des Arts Premiers at the Quai Branly. This itinerant historical approach of Paris will be complemented by an exploration of the contemporary cultural and artistic politics of the Black stage. by Attending theater plays, dance shows, and concerts, and meeting African and Caribbean artists living in Paris (playwrights, directors, actors, choreographers, dancers, musicians), students will enjoy the opportunity to explore Black Parisian culture from an insider's point of view and find out what it means to be a Black artist today in France.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the \nColumbia Summer in Paris Program\n through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term B\u00a0dates.",

    "course_descr":"This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.  We begin by reading and discussing Plato's\u00a0\nSymposium\n\u00a0and Aristotle's\u00a0\nNicomachean Ethics\n, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom\u2014a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia? \u00a0  Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s concept of existential freedom found in\u00a0\nBeing and Nothingness\n\u00a0and Soren Kierkegaard\u2019s religious freedom from\u00a0\nFear and Trembling\n, which Donald Palmer introduces in\u00a0\nDoes the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy\n. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work\u00a0\nThe Myth of Sisyphus\n. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.  In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",

What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?\n \n We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.\n \n Course readings include such influential works as Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's \"Sensations and Brain Processes,\u201d Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Mental States,\u201d and Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cWhat is it Like to be a Bat?\u201d Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.\n \n The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",

    "course_descr":"At the end of the Cold War, many in the West celebrated what they perceived as not only a political victory over the Soviet Union but also the intellectual and ideological ascendency of liberal democracy. And yet three decades later many liberal democracies are facing numerous challenges, if not outright crises.  This course explores the key political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world that seek to challenge, improve, and even threaten liberal democracy. We begin by asking what an ideology is, before delving into the various -isms including liberalism itself, capitalism, socialism, communism, populism, and nationalism. We investigate how these ideologies shape societies and mold social behavior, exploring their origins and principles. We ask how these ideologies intersect with democratic governance and offer different understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship. Our goal is not to determine which ideology is best but rather to understand and critique the many different ways of thinking about politics and society. We draft initial ideology statements, to be revised during the course as students reflect on and question their own assumptions and beliefs through engagement with different perspectives. Participants also engage in debates with their peers in order to practice articulating arguments in a persuasive manner.  Morning sessions are normally dedicated to reviewing and clarifying the assigned material, which includes classic and contemporary works in political theory as well as news and magazine articles and film clips. In the afternoon, students apply their understanding in group activities including debates, and engage with guest speakers from various ideological positions.  By the end of the course, participants not only better understand the key ideologies of the modern world but are also equipped with the analytical tools to critique and revise them in a forward-thinking way.",

    "course_descr":"The idea that culture influences politics has been a core theme of the modern social sciences. But scholars have debated what culture is, what it influences, and how. The course looks at some of the foundational works in this literature. It then focuses on the stream of research that uses survey research methods and in so doing, focuses on the understanding of political culture as a distribution within a society of values, norms, and attitudes toward political objects. Within this literature, we look at how social scientists using survey research have assessed the impact of political culture on one type of behavior, political participation, and one type of attitude, regime legitimacy. This in turn involves a discussion of the distinction in the literature between democratic and authoritarian regime types, and how they differ with respect to drivers of participation and causes of legitimacy. The course deals with culture, regime type, participation, and legitimacy at both the conceptual and methodological levels. By critiquing prominent works in the field, we will learn more about problems of measurement, question formulation, response category design, and questionnaire design, and about practical problems of gaining access and conducting interviews in various social and political environments. We will develop an appreciation of how sampling techniques affect the reliability of findings, and discuss the possibilities and limits of using non-random and flawed samples. Students who can use statistical software will have an opportunity to work with the Asian Barometer Survey Wave 4 dataset.",

If someone behaves unreasonably, what are they failing to do? Is reason at odds with passion, rhetoric, authority, or religious conviction? Are there spcial ways in which citizens and public officials should reason in public life? Is it realistic to expect people to exercise \"public\" forms of reason in a culturally diverse and politically polarized society that sometimes seems indifferent to rational argument? What is the relationship between \"reasonable\" political discourse and familiar contemporary concepts like \"political correctness\"? This course studies some influential classical and contemporary answers to these and related questions drawn from a variety of thinkers, especially Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, Jurgen Habermas, Onora O'niell, and Christine Korsgaard.",

We ask what principles define these ideologies, how these ideologies intersect with democracy, and how they produce and require different meanings and understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship.  Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.  By the end of the three weeks, students are equipped with not only a deeper understanding of the competing political and economic ideologies that shape the modern world, but also with the tools to make, understand, and critically evaluate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their future studies and as future citizens and leaders.",

We will consider current events related to COVID19 in these topics as well. The critical role of the immune system in brain development and the potential role of early-life inflammatory events in the etiology of psychopathology (autism, schizophrenia), allergies and autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative conditions (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's) will be highlighted.",

This will be done initially at the outset of the residency, as the orthopedic residents will first be introduced to standard requirements for New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical practice. This will transition to clinical care as well as getting opportunities to participate in learning opportunities within other sub-specialty clinic settings. To determine the suitability of individuals with complex cases for physical therapy services, residents will develop medical screening abilities through targeted knowledge acquisition, assessment skills, and integration of imaging findings and pharmacology interactions. Residents will spend time within the musculoskeletal radiology service, orthopedics, dental services as well as other orthopedic related clinics to increase the resident\u2019s orthopedic knowledge.\u00a0 Residents will also document patient cases by diagnostic criteria as well as complete APTA \u201ctechnique\u201d examinations of the UE, LE and the Spine as determined by ABPTRFE.",

This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",

Emphasis will also be placed on opportunities to synthesize these two approaches. The course will start with an introduction to Python, the scikit-learn package and GitHub. After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python.

This course crosses chronological eras, geographical regions, and academic disciplines to explore configurations of crime and punishment in Jewish cultures.

We critically address questions such as the following: (a) Given the diverse range of religions in the world, what is it that makes them all religions? (b) Is it possible for miracles to occur? (c) What is the relationship between science and religion? (d) Is it reasonable to believe in an afterlife for beings like us?  We broach such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own views. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  \n  \nTo acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.\n  \nTo develop an understanding of the different branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy.\n  \nTo accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers\u2019 works on fundamental issues in philosophy of religion, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.\n  \nTo critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.",

Established ideas about individuality and collectivity, about how to depict reality, about language, gender, authority, and violence, were all thrown open to radical questioning. Out of this chaos came ideas about literature and film (just for example) which have shaped Western thought on these subjects to this day. In this course we will study a variety of media and genres (poetry, manifestos, film, painting, photomontage, the novel, theoretical essays) in an effort to gain a deep understanding of this complex and fascinating period in Russian cultural history.",

    "course_descr":"The story of the US nuclear weapons testing program in the Marshall Islands can be viewed as\u00a0the collision of a powerful nuclear weapons state, eager to aggressively pursue a thermonuclear weapons development program, and an indigenous population in a remote location. After World War II, the Marshall Islands became a US territory, as specified by a UN treaty, and the US immediately initiated a testing program to be conducted in the northern expanse of the islands.\u00a0The testing was done in an overtly public manner and driven at the time by a Cold War mentality. As a result of the testing, the Marshallese people were both driven away from their homes and lands and exposed to radioactive fallout. A classified human subject health monitoring program was implemented under the name Project 4.1. From these tests, the US government was able to study the effects of nuclear fallout and the correlation to cancer rates in the Marshallese population, exposed at different distances from the test sites and over a time period of decades.  This course is about the violent intersection of science and culture. Students will investigate the Marshallese culture prior to the nuclear weapons testing program and then study the ways in which the culture and people were affected by the program. They will also consider the challenges the Marshallese face today. The course will end on a series of group research projects to compare and contrast the Marshall Islands case with those of other indigenous populations affected by nuclear testing performed by other nuclear weapons states. For the course\u2019s final project, the students will apply the tools learned in this course about nuclear weapons and culture and apply them to the French government\u2019s nuclear testing program in either French Polynesians\u00a0or Algeria.",

    "course_descr":"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.  Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the \u201ccommodified self\u201d and \u201cself-branding.\u201d 2) \u201cDigital surveillance\u201d and the \u201cmanaged self.\u201d 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically \u201cmarginalized\u201d identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",

    "course_title":"Structural Determinants of Health",
    "course_descr":"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one\u2019s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual\u2019s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.\u00a0This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the \u201cSocial\u201d Determinants of Health to the \u201cStructural\u201d Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes.\u00a0The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual\u2019s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an \u201cupstream\u201d approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes.\u00a0An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities.\u00a0Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual\u2019s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one\u2019s class position and the color of one\u2019s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experience of it.",

And how do students make sense of their lives in the context of schools and educational systems more broadly? In this class we will examine education as a central institution in modern society, and we will grapple with an important question: What role does education play in reinforcing or challenging broader patterns of social inequality and mobility? Particular emphasis will be placed on higher education as a critical site in which these processes take shape.",

We\u2019ll explore the history, social institutions and laws, ideas, practices, and theories of human rights. We\u2019ll become familiar with the social actors, social structures, and relationships involved in practices such as violation, claims-making, advocacy, and protection. We\u2019ll consider how social, cultural, political, and economic forces affect human rights issues. We\u2019ll learn about the questions sociologists ask, starting with the most basic (but far from simple) question, \u201cwhat is a human right?\u201d We\u2019ll tackle key debates in the field, considering \u2013 for instance \u2013 whether human rights are universal and how human rights relate to cultural norms\/values, national sovereignty, and national security. Finally, we\u2019ll apply the concepts we\u2019ve learned to a wide range of issues (ex: how racial, ethnic, gender, and other social inequalities relate to human rights), rights (ex: LGBTQ rights, the rights of laborers, the rights of refugees), and cases (ex: enslavement, the separation of children from their families, circumcision, sterilization, the use of torture). We\u2019ll consider human rights cases in the United States and across the globe, and how events and actions in one place relate to human rights violations in another.",

The country soon furnished itself with the requisite trappings of modernity, including a liberal juridical system intended to turn subjects into citizens and replace the Black Legend of the obscurantist, Catholic empire with the image of a modern state organized around the rule of law. Inspired by a literature emerging in Europe and the United States as the symbolic counterpart of this turn to ideals of order and reason, Spanish writers tried their hand at appropriating its conventions throughout a century of domestic political turmoil stretching from the First and Second Republics (1868-74 and 1932-36) to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939-75) and the transition to democracy soon after his death. In their own crime and detection novels, Spanish authors probed the contours of the nation\u2019s uneven political and cultural evolution. Class readings and discussion are conducted in Spanish.",

    "course_descr":"This course offers an intensive exploration of one of the fundamental principle of physics \u2013relativity. Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.  Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe.  In the process of exploring these challenging topics, course participants expand their capacity for creative problem solving and their ability to think critically and independently.",

An important goal of the class is to have students work in groups to apply economic concepts to current public policy issues having to do with urban environmental and earth systems. The use of the worlds water bodies and the atmosphere as economic inputs to production are also examined. The economics of renewable resources is described and sustainable economic development models are discussed and analyzed. Some time will also be devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues.

    "course_descr":"This is an interdisciplinary workshop for scientists, future NGO workers and journalists seeking skills in communicating 21st-century global science to the public. Scientists will be given journalism skills; journalists will learn how to use science as the basis of their story-telling. The course is designed to give students exercises and real-world experiences in producing feature stories on global science topics. While most scientists and international affairs professionals have been trained to write in the style of peer-reviewed journals, we will focus on journalism techniques, learning how to translate global science into accessible true stories that reach wide audiences.  Science is performed by passionate individuals who use their intelligence and determination to seek answers from nature. By telling their histories and uncovering the drama of discovery, we believe that there are ways for science to be successfully communicated to readers who might otherwise fear it.",

    "course_descr":"The course intends to give an overview of forests \u2013 how they function, and how they can be managed sustainably. The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.\u00a0 The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.\u00a0 For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival. The course is going to emphasize the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contribution of deforestation to climate change.",

Workshops and lectures during the first week introduce students to the demands of play development. Students then elect to specialize in one of three areas: acting, directing, or playwriting. The remainder of the course is given over to the development of short plays to be written, directed, and acted by the students under the supervision of theatrical professionals. In small, autonomous groups of actors, each with its own director and playwright, students create a production to be mounted at the end of the program.  Workshops are interactive, with the evolving pieces of each play periodically shown to the entire group for feedback in a safe, supportive environment. The course affords students a unique opportunity to experience the nuances of professional theatrical collaboration.  In the last two days of each session, several of the completed plays are performed for an audience of peers, friends, and family members. Students present two evening performances and one matinee.",

Ultimately participants film mini-pilots or key scenes from the shows they have developed.\n \n We begin with a brief history of television in the United States \u2013 its creation and how it has grown over the past seven decades. Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or \u201creality\u201d) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.\n \n While learning about the \u201cTV greats,\u201d students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers\u2019 medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.\n \n The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",

    "course_descr":"Designed for students with a strong interest in law, oral argument, and mock trial, this course immerses participants in the adversarial world of the trial court.  Following an introduction to the United States legal system, students acquire a solid understanding of the trial process, including jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses and experts, introduction of exhibits, closing arguments, and theory building. Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.  Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.  The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.  Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently. At the heart of the program are daily exercises, designed to hone students' trial skills, that are rooted in a hypothetical legal case.  The program culminates in a mock trial session held at the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Manhattan, where students are divided into teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to present their case, prepared over the course of the program, through jury verdict.",

We will assess which kinds of research problems and theoretical perspectives are a good fit with ethnography and the roles that ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects.

How does studying homelessness provide insight into the ways urban spaces are made? Why have shelters become the primary public response to homelessness in New York? How are race and gender central to the project of building a shelter infrastructure in New York? How are shelters experienced by those living in them?

An emphasis will be placed on the editing, sequencing, and display of images while cultivating a theoretical and historical context to situate the work. Students will engage with an array of photographic practices through presentations, guest artist lectures, and field trips. Additional readings by artists and writers will be assigned for the class to collectively discuss critical issues in contemporary image-making.",

This course will also prepare students for professional work preparing art for venues of that type. This class will be structured around studio work, with an emphasis on the development and production of a final site-specific project. In order to foster students\u2019 growth and ongoing investigation into the nature of contemporary sculpture, the class will also be comprised of slide lectures, visits to local artists\u2019 studios, and galleries, as well as various public art projects throughout the city. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from research to intensive studio work on a final project, often a proposal for a site-specific work in a non-traditional venue. Generally, the first half of each class session will be dedicated to lecture and discussion, while the second half will be dedicated to individual studio work and critique.",

    "course_descr":"What happens to a body stilled in space, when it takes a shape and holds it? How does its relationship to public space change? How is its transformation attenuated when the body is in formation with other bodies, a breathing still life of people and props? This performance art course will use the question of a body\u2019s stillness as a platform to create interdisciplinary projects that exist between dance, sculpture, collaborative movement, and performance art. Through core readings and case study presentations, we will discuss unique possibilities of representation and challenges this form enables, and the prominent role it has been taking within the visual arts in recent years. Students will engage with a variety of aesthetic strategies and formal techniques such as movement workshops, sensory exercises, video, wearable sculptures, collaboration, scores, and group meditation. Studio work will focus on concrete intersections between the body and the object, and case studies chosen to encourage students to think of movement as a form of resistance, and to consider the political implication of collaborative work that unfolds over time. Performativity in the context of this class is widely defined, and no prior experience is required.",

Asking the question of why we use ceramics as a material and, further, why we choose the materials we do to make art. Rigorous group and individual critiques focusing on the above questions will be held. The goal of this course is to supply the students with the knowledge and skill necessary to work in ceramics and enough proficiency and understanding of the material to enable them to successfully incorporate it into their practice.

Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.  In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.  In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.  Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film.

It aims to clarify: 1) the historiographical situation by questioning and analyzing the French regulatory system and its many avatars in Europe, the United States and in the colonial world, but also questioning the backlash to this system that consisted firstly of the abolitionist (born in England in the second half of the nineteenth century) and then the prohibitionist movements; 2) The relationship between class, \u201crace\u201d and gender in the sex market via issues of human trafficking and sex tourism in Europe, America, Africa and Asia; 3) The socio-economic issue - and its political connections \u2013 in the economy of sex with particular attention to individuals (prostitutes versus sex workers), their voices, their legal status, and even their mobilization (rallies and demonstrations, community collectives and trade unions, political and \/ or literary publications), but also the many heated debates that these demands for recognition and these mobilizations have provoked in places as diverse as France, the Netherlands and India to take only three specific examples in the world covered in the course.  To enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the \nColumbia Summer in Paris Program\n through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n\u00a0Tuition charges apply; scholarships available.\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term B\u00a0dates.",

    "course_descr":"This course introduces the interdisciplinary field of transgender studies. While we will read about gender variable bodies within a long historical arc, the categories of both \u201ctranssexual\u201d and \"transgender\" are recent social constructions. How did the many different forms of gender variance resolve into these singular forms and what has been lost in the medical and legal narrowing of gender variance to only these forms? Can we make any connections between witches in the 17th century (often accused on the grounds of cross-gender identification), mollies and dandies in the 19th century (often marked as effeminate), inverts in the late 19th and early 20th century and later constructions that assemble under the banner of \u201ctrans*\u201d?  Many academic disciplines-- including anthropology, history, gender studies, literary studies, and gay and lesbian\/queer studies--have studied transgender identities, bodies and communities, but only very recently has the field become institutionalized in the academy as a discipline \"Transgender Studies.\" In this course we examine the ongoing development of the concept of transgender as it is situated across social, cultural, historical, medical, and political contexts. Along the way, we will try to answer some fundamental questions: when did trans* emerge as a distinct social formation? What might be the differences between the understanding of gender variance in the second half of the 20th century and formulations of the phenomena of cross-dressing and passing and transvestism in earlier periods? Is the term \"transgender\" applicable to non-Western and previously occurring embodiments and practices?",

By exploring these changes in the works of scholars like Tim Wu and Bernard Harcourt we will gain a deeper sense of contemporary sexual politics in \u201cexpository society\u201d as we determine the criteria for evaluating the success of the modern celebrity. Finally, we will consider how the celebrity reality tv industrial-complex shifts notions of sex, power, and god by exploring the emergence of icons \u201cfamous for being famous\u201d in the 21st century whose command of attention and social influence in the digital age represents power, capital, and divine myth befitting a queen: Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian West.",

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",

    "course_title":"WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL",
    "course_descr":"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",

The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

    "course_title":"HOW TO WRITE FUNNY",
    "course_descr":"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

Department approval NOT required.\u00a0  In this course, we will look at some of\u00a0the\u00a0most dynamic examples of \"visual\u00a0writing.\" To begin, we will look at writers\u00a0writing\u00a0about art, from\u00a0the\u00a0Romantic period through\u00a0the\u00a0present.\u00a0The\u00a0modes of this art\u00a0writing\u00a0we will consider include:\u00a0the\u00a0practice of ekphrasis (poems which address or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, John Ashbery, and Eileen Myles, who for periods of their lives worked as art critics; writers such as Etel Adnan and Alexander Kulge, who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure; as well as numerous collaborations between writers and\u00a0visual\u00a0artists. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers, like artists Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, David Wojnarowicz, Moyra Davey, Paul Chan, and Hannah Black, as well as professional critics whose work has been elevated to\u00a0the\u00a0status of literature, such as Hilton Als, Janet Malcolm, and Susan Sontag. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a \u201cmilieu\u201d of sonic and\u00a0visual\u00a0artists, such as those associated with Dada,\u00a0the\u00a0Harlem Renaissance,\u00a0the\u00a0New York School, and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout\u00a0the\u00a0course, students\u00a0will also be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout\u00a0the\u00a0city. They\u00a0will produce original works in various of\u00a0the\u00a0modes described above and complete a final\u00a0writing\u00a0project that incorporates what they have learned.",

    "course_descr":"Do rats laugh? Do dogs pretend? Can birds use tools? While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.  This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology\u2014the study of animal minds\u2014and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin\u2019s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the \u201cfather of cognitive ethology,\u201d whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.  In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson. These pioneering researchers fundamentally changed our understanding of the animal mind, shedding new light on the extraordinary and diverse abilities of our fellow species to learn, problem-solve, use tools, express emotions, and even mourn their dead. What\u2019s more, we are learning that animals communicate complex information in ways we could never have imagined.  Field excursions to locations such as the Central Park Zoo, the Wild Bird Fund, and the Wolf Conservation Center offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behaviors up close, emulate observation techniques used by scientists in the field, and speak to experts about their research. These first-hand experiences provide context for the material covered in class, and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions. Students also have an opportunity to explore the broad array of academic and career paths that relate to cognitive ethology, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, conservation biology, psychology, philosophy and ethics, co",
