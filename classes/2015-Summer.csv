Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.  Class lectures and presentations will be supplemented with trips to New York's world-renowned museums.",Kent M Minturn,1:00pm,4:10pm,13137,Morningside,S3643-20152-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/353,silver,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211221300/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3643-20152-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S4425,ARTS BET ITALY & EASTRN MEDIT,"This course will explore the role of the visual arts within networks of cultural exchange, focusing particularly on the relationship between the Italian peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Concrete points of interactionincluding collecting practices, the travel of artists, and the market for luxury goods-will be considered alongside broader intellectual exchanges that resulted in new formulations within visual culture--such as the influence of Arabic science on the development of perspectival painting and the recuperation of a common Byzantine past in architectural design. In this way we will probe previous boundaries-both geographic and materialinscribed within long-standing notions of the European Renaissance, thus entering into dialogue with current scholarship that seeks new ways of understanding the early modem period. A key component of the course will include visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to allowing us to examine works of art first hand, we will also be able to consider how the mecha.Iisms of display within the museum context further inflect contemporary understanding of these historical objects. In this regard the Metropolitan Museum serves as an excellent resource not only for the breadth of its collections, but also due to its recent reorganization of those Galleries previously grouped under the heading Islamic Art. The newly anointed Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia, will present an interesting case study for the students. Further, in our units on architecture will take advantage of the digital image resources provided by the Media Center for Art History's Istanbul Documentation Project.",Jessica A Maratsos,9:00am,12:10pm,77029,Morningside,S4425-20152-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/3949,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211221304/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S4425-20152-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Columbia College

ANTH S3722,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VIOLENCE,"This course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to the issue of violence with an exploration of three particular themes. Our main focus will be on the idea of representation, ethnographically and theoretically, of the concept of violence. First, we will look at how violence has been situated as an object of study within anthropology, as a theoretical concept as well as in practice. We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality. We will pay particular attention to the concept of the ""Muslim woman"" in both the colonial and colonized imagination.",Ellen Marakowitz,1:00pm,4:10pm,16368,Morningside,S3722-20152-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3387,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211215536/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3722-20152-001/,467 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S4187,ETHNOGRAPHY OF SOUTH ASIA,"This course is an ethnographic and historical introduction to the construction of gender and feminist theory in the South Asian context. We will focus on textual and visual material, primarily ethnographies and films, to provide a critique of normative representations of the ""South Asian woman"". These readings will be used to reveal the complex social and historical configurations that institute and obscure gendered experiences and representations within the colonial imagination and their colonized others. A significant motif of this course will be to develop alternative ways of knowing and understanding gender construction, sexual relations, and community formation in South Asia.",Carol Henderson,5:30pm,8:40pm,67405,Morningside,S4187-20152-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211215538/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S4187-20152-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

CLEN S3208,MODERN COMPARATIVE FICTION,"This course takes the “impression” as a cue to explore fiction, philosophy, and visual art of the period from roughly 1874, the year of the first Impressionist exhibition, to 1925, well into the Modernist period, in order to understand how and why “impressionism” came to have such central importance for writers, artists, and other thinkers. We will ask how and why this idea developed over time, how it influenced and was influenced by movements in realism and Modernism, and how the idea of the impression continues to influence the arts today. This class will be both international in scope, focusing on works by French, British, and American authors, and interdisciplinary, encompassing works of different literary genres, including the novel, the short story, and the sketch, as well as works of painting, photography, philosophy, psychology, and criticism. Each week will include discussions of numerous paintings of the period, and we will often focus on the relationships between different artistic media. The course will also include field trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Authors to be covered include Zola, Maupassant, Pater, James, Crane, Hemingway, Ford, and Woolf. This course will satisfy the department’s genre requirement for prose fiction.",Zachary J Roberts,1:00pm,4:10pm,27966,Morningside,S3208-20152-001,LIT IMPRESSIONISM: 1874-1925,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,http://localhost:8801/professors/11432,gold,9.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211231430/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/S3208-20152-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

The selected stories and poems cover the gamut of modern experience in diverse cultures and exhibit an exciting range of narrative and poetic styles. Our fundamental questions: How do these writings illuminate different dimensions of social life in our complex, globalized world? How do the readings vary depending on the author's home or adoptive culture? Do certain themes emerge as ""universal""? How do these works explore ethical values, and what lessons might we learn for living in our dynamic but troubled world?

EMPA U7234,SUSTAINABILITY POLICY & MANAGEMENT,"Sustainability management matters because we only have one planet, and we must learn how to manage our organizations in a way that ensures that our planet is maintained. The course is designed to introduce you to the field of sustainability policy and sustainability management. This is not an academic course that reviews the literature of the field and discusses how scholars think about the management of organizations that are environmentally sound. It is a practical, professional course organized around the core concepts of management and the core concepts of sustainability and the role that public policy plays in influencing behavior within organizations and among individuals, in order to facilitate and speed up the transition to a sustainable economy. Each week we will go through several cases in sustainability management or policy, and some background material designed to help you answer the questions posed at the end of each case exercise. The cases always pose practical issues for decision makers to address-but issues that are best addressed with a firm grounding in the literature of policy, management and sustainability. Some cases will be used as the basis for class discussion, while other cases require a written assignment - either individually or in a group. The literature and case material we will study this semester are based on lessons learned in government, non-profits and the private sector.

The course uses many teaching techniques: short lectures, individual and group exercises, videotaped presentations, role plays, case discussions, video clips, and writing assignments. We'll begin by considering some recent crises and evaluating the strategies used to manage them and then discuss best practices in crisis communications. You'll have a chance to practice developing key messages for a controversial topic and practice responding to difficult and hostile questions about your position on that topic. We'll also hear from an expert in the field of crisis and media about strategies and practices that have worked in the past. Finally, you'll work with a team to develop a statement and set of core messages you'll aim to communicate during a mock ""press conference.""",Kristian Denny,9:00am,4:00pm,25509,Morningside,U7420-20152-001,,International and Public Affairs,EMPA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212000224/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EMPA/U7420-20152-001/,801 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,1,,FSU,20152EMPA7420U001,SEMINAR
EMPA U7425,COMMUNICATING IN ORGANIZATIONS,"Communicating in Organizations is a survey course that explores aspects of day-to-day managerial communication, relating to presentations and other high-profile moments, as well as more routine elements of interpersonal communication. The course uses many teaching techniques: short lectures, individual and group exercises, videotaped presentations, role plays, case discussions, video clips, and writing assignments. It is highly experiential with exercises or presentations scheduled in most sessions. Initially, we'll focus on the communication skills and strategies that help you present your ideas to others. I'll ask you to do two benchmark assignments a letter and a brief presentation-to assess the abilities you bring to the course. In several of our class sessions you'll be the one in front of the room, delivering either a prepared talk or brief, impromptu comments. Such assignments will give you a chance to develop your skills as a presenter. I'll also discuss the link between listening and speaking, showing you how developing your listening skills will improve your effectiveness as a speaker. And we'll explore several elements of visual communication, including how to design effective visual aids and written documents. To communicate effectively in such roles as coach, interviewer, negotiator, or facilitator, you need to be skilled at listening, questioning, observing behavior, and giving feedback. We'll practice each of these skills in class exercises and assignments. The Social Style instrument will give you detailed feedback about how others view your communication style. You'll find out how style differences may lead to miscommunication, missed opportunities, or mishandled conflict.",Joann P Baney,1:30pm,3:30pm,81896,Morningside,U7425-20152-001,,International and Public Affairs,EMPA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212000225/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EMPA/U7425-20152-001/,801 International Affairs Building,,International and Public Affairs,3,,TWR,20152EMPA7425U001,SEMINAR

ENGL S4401,18TH CENTURY & ROMANTIC POETRY,"This course is a study of romantic poetry and poetics but does not approach its subject from the belated perspective of the Victorians or the Moderns. Instead, the famous Romantics of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are viewed proleptically, from the vantage point of early and mid 18th-century poets who established the modern criteria and generated the forms and ideas later ingeniously personalized by the poets we customarily refer to as the Romantics. Indeed, though we shall spend the concluding half of our study with Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats, our study begins with the neoclassical romanticism of Pope, Thomson, Akenside, the Wartons, Gray, and Goldsmith. As such, our reading entails a study of lyric trends bridging 18th - and 19th - century verse and of related discourses in aesthetic psychology, moral philosophy, experimental religion, natural description, and affective criticism. We shall attend closely to rhetorical and prosodic elements, with a view to characteristic genres (ode, epistle, georgic, epitaph), innovative hybrids and new forms (elegy, the ""conversational"" poem). Recommended and required readings in prose are of the period and include theoretical and critical writings by our poets.",Marianne Giordani,1:00pm,4:10pm,24845,Morningside,S4401-20152-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/3085,silver,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211234730/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S4401-20152-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

An examination of the different forms of staged comedy throughout the centuries, beginning with foundational texts from Ancient Greece, especially Aristophanes. We consider how today's playwrights are still building on, and making reference to, primary works from the Western canon. Texts we will read range from Shakespeare, Jonson and Restoration comedies, to Wilde, Beckett, Hansberry, Tennessee Williams, Pinter, and Churchill. We will also cover contemporary work seen on the stages of New York, including short comic plays, stand up, and physical comedy. Attention will be given to comic characters, comic pretense, wit, humor, comedy of errors, comic gestures, comic archetypes, farce, cross-dressing, satiric comedy, comic relief, tragicomedy, romantic comedy, and theatre of the absurd.

This course will take a prolonged look at this form of art in order to trace the history of comics and graphic novels in America. Focusing on representative texts that define and redefine the medium, we will learn how to approach comics as a distinct literary and visual form, while familiarizing ourselves with the critical vocabulary of ""sequential art."" By examining the graphic novel with an eye toward the literary, the course will explore a variety of genres and the ways they deploy conventional literary forms such as allegory, epic, character, setting, symbolism, and metaphor. We will consider how comics resist, represent, and entrench dominant cultural ideologies about power, myth, heroism, humor, adolescence, gender, sexuality, family, poverty, religion, censorship, and the immigrant experience. The course will provide students with the critical tools to read this key vehicle of contemporary creative expression. Readings will include seminal works and newer classics, by Gaiman, Bell, Miller, Moore, Crumb, Bell, Spiegelman, Ware, Derf, and shorter pieces by many others. In addition, we will read selections from texts on graphic narrative theory and comics history, beginning with Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics.",Karen L Green,5:30pm,8:40pm,75882,Morningside,S4526-20152-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/6086,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160211234732/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S4526-20152-001/,511 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

International Students are not eligible for this course, as it does not provide academic credit. The Television Writing Intensive is a six week, concentrated and encompassing introduction into the field of television writing, designed to prepare students for the professional worlds of sit-coms, one-hour dramas and police / medical procedurals. In an interconnected program consisting of two intensive writing workshops and a lecture series with guest writers and professionals in the field, students gain the knowledge and authority to explore, examine and create the kind of groundbreaking work that is taking over cable and making its way onto the Networks, here and around the world. The Television Writing Intensive focuses on two specific tracks. One track is the half-hour comedy; the other is the one-hour drama. These two formats, although having much in common, come out of different traditions and are conceived and written in different ways. * This intensive course will meet 15 hours per week, on Mondays and Tuesdays for six hours during the day (exact times TBD), and Thursday evenings for three hours (exact time TBD). These times are probable but subject to change based on availability of guest speakers and other opportunities which may arise, but the general format will stay the same if changes do occur.  Meaning, the course will meet for two week days for six hours and one week night for three hours, avoiding Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.",Alan Kingsberg,6:00pm,8:00pm,13030,Morningside,S0431-20152-001,,Film,FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212000347/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/S0431-20152-001/,507 Dodge Hall,,Summer Session,0,,R,20152FILM0431S001,WORKSHOP

Just as innovative modes of production, online distribution, and exhibition have fundamentally changed documentary practice, dynamic forms of documentary have had a profound influence on how people view their local community and the broader world around them. This course explores how prominent filmmakers, public television stations, international human rights groups, and amateur videomakers have made use of and shaped today's changing documentary formats. We will examine films by Errol Morris, Oliver Stone, and Spike Lee, television programs by ESPN and PBS, online short productions by VICE and citizen journalists, and elaborate 3D projects by the New York Times.

FILM S4034,COMEDY WRITING ACROSS MEDIA,"Writing comedy has its own rules and rhythms. Like a good standup routine, a good comedy script is the product of a writer with a clear point of view. Finding the correct tone is the most demanding part of comedy writing and in this class, we'll take up the challenge together. It's an exciting time for comedy. Some of the best of the best work out there can be just as easily found on Funny or Die or YouTube, as it can on theaters or on TV. This course will explore comedy as comedy and address comedy writing regardless the form. In the first class students will immediately pitch their ideas to the class (this can include: screenplay, half-hour pilot, web series) and then with the instructor develop a unique plan of attack for completing their project by session's end. Then, week after week, they will bring in pages of their project for work-shopping. Also every week, the instructor will lecture on the various comedic forms, their similarities and differences, character-based jokes vs. broader physical comedy, the differences between satire and parody. Written and visual comedy samples will also be an integral part of every class. The class will meet twice a week for three hours each time during the six-week session.

FREN S3880,FR EXPRESSV DANCE-NYC & PARIS,"Cross-Atlantic influences from both French ballet and French modern dance as seen on the stages of New York City. The course examines not only French dancers and choreographers, but also French conceptions of the expressive body seen in other urban art forms. We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City. When possible, we will attend modern dance performances, and productions of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet. As well, we will visit New York City museums and gallery exhibits, and allied cultural events that help to illustrate the lyric French style. The course will be conducted in English.

This seminar will introduce students to different structures of global governance for development, trade, labor, finance, the environment, migration, and intellectual property and investigate their relationship with human rights. Students will learn about public, private, and mixed forms of governance, analyze the ethical and strategic perspectives of the various stakeholders and relate them to existing human rights norms.

It considers a wide range of visual media (photography, painting, sculpture), as well as aspects of visuality (surveillance, profiling). We will use case studies ranging in time from the early modern period (practices in which the body was marked to measure criminality, for example), to the present day. Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images. Subjects to be addressed include: the nature of evidence; documentation and witness; censorship; iconoclasm; surveillance; profiling; advocacy images; signs on the body; visibility and invisibility.",Susan M Merriam,1:00pm,4:10pm,20380,Morningside,S4190-20152-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212002653/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4190-20152-001/,318 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

The course attempts to involve students actively in the process of critical listening, both in the classroom and in concerts that the students attend and write about. The extraordinary richness of musical life in New York is thus an integral part of the course. Although not a history of Western music, the course is taught in a chronological format and includes masterpieces by Josquin des Prez, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, among others.

INAF S6554,UN & THE CHAL OF PEACE,"It is now a well known fact that countries embroiled in conflict seldom emerge from it ""once and for all."" They tend to relapse back into conflict within months or years. The reasons are also well-known: low education and high poverty levels, weak or non- existent institutions, poor governance, exclusion and marginalization of certain groups including women and poor economic prospects certainly in livelihoods. And yet Peace building in the international context is a relatively new concept. It appeared in the in the UN lexicon in the 1980s and has evolved as a normative concept since. Peace building is complex and multi-faceted encompassing security, human rights, development and reconciliation of past differences and ultimately societal transformation. It is before everything else a political exercise. This course will ask: How is Peace building done, who are the actors and stakeholders? What lessons have we learnt since the 1980s? What does it take to build the peace? The course will give an understanding of the evolution of the norm of peace building at the United Nations and discuss the new UN Peace building architecture. Ten years after its creation, has the Peace Building Commission made a difference and why? What have been its challenges? It will look at the many stakeholders on the ground and discuss the issue of coordination and the need for integrated strategies. It will provide examples of countries that have succeeded, analyze the root causes of the conflicts and the tools which were used. It will extract the lessons learned and the conditions for peace building to succeed.",Judy Cheng-Hopkins,6:15pm,9:25pm,78346,Morningside,S6554-20152-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212004025/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6554-20152-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

POLS S3133,ISSUES IN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY,"This course considers some fundamental puzzles about the nature of law. Legal philosophers, judges, academic lawyers, and political scientists give very different answers to the following key questions: What is law? What kind of question is ""what is law?""? Does law have a function and if so what is it? Is there a relationship between law and ideas of morality or social justice? Does law impose upon citizens an obligation to obey it and if so what is the nature of that obligation and how does it arise? Do we have an obligation to obey unjust laws? How should we interpret laws that are vague, ambiguous, or contradictory? How should judges in a democratic society decide legal disputes? How in fact do judges in our society decide legal disputes? Our goal is to wrestle with these problems and, with some luck, form our own ideas about whether and how they might be resolved. We will consider a variety of recent contributions from within legal, political, and moral philosophy, sociology, judicial political science, economics, the philosophy of language, and ,even literary interpretation. Our focus will be on the most important scholarly contributions in Anglophone legal philosophy, along with several landmark American court cases which raise important theoretical questions.",Luke S Macinnis,6:15pm,9:25pm,22795,Morningside,S3133-20152-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/11978,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212015634/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/S3133-20152-001/,201B Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

This course is an introduction to how sustainability/ESG (economic, environmental, social & governance) issues have become financially material to the global credit, underwriting, insurance, risk management, venture capital and asset management capital markets. These issues have a direct impact on risk exposure and the quality of public, private and government debt/equity investments. By the end of the course, students should understand how these issues affect investment decisions made by institutional investors, corporate lenders, insurance companies, asset management funds, hedge funds, venture capitalists and retail investors, as well as business decisions made by corporate managers. They will be exposed to the global sources of environmental/sustainability corporate performance information, how ""best-in-class"" environmental investment relates to, and is different from, socially-responsible investing (SRI), and differences between European, North American and Asian markets. Risk management aspects of sustainable finance will be addressed, especially in regards to emerging finance areas such as carbon finance, corporate governance, sustainable development and agriculture/water development projects.

SUMA K4360,SUST TECH & EVOLUTION OF SMART CITIES,"This course is offered through the School of Professional Studies. 
The progress of sustainability in recent years has almost entirely been a result in the evolution of smart, sustainable technology solutions. This course examines opportunities to drive sustainability through technology applications with the end goal of piecing together all of the pieces to envision an intelligent city. Companies are increasingly turning to technology to fulfill their sustainability goals considering many technologies provide off-the-shelf, cost-effective and immediate savings compared to operationally invasive, resource-heavy sustainability transformation programs. Sustainability technology ranges from intelligent infrastructure to mobile applications that help to drive the ""sharing economy"". The course will provide an overview of the sustainability technologies that large corporations are actively pursuing and delve into the project management and integration strategies required to implement these solutions. Successful sustainability practitioners must not only have a strong understanding of the values and methodologies of sustainable operations, but also the tools and technologies available to drive sustainability throughout their organization. Upon completion of the class, students will have a sufficient level of understanding to discuss these solutions and relevant case studies with potential employers. This course will benefit anyone interested in a career in sustainability or in smart cities as it will provide them the skills and analytical capabilities to analyze which sustainability technologies are a good fit for their company's sustainability and growth strategy.",Gregory J Falco,6:10pm,8:00pm,25529,Morningside,K4360-20152-001,EVOLUTION OF SMART CITIES,School of Professional Studies,SUMA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212030526/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K4360-20152-001/,405 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

SUMA K4370,IMPLEMENTATION OF CORP SUST STRATEGIES,"This course is offered through the School of Professional Studies. 
This is an applied course on the metrics, indicators and tools used by businesses to implement strategically relevant Corporate Social and Environmentally Responsibility (CR) or Sustainability programs. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the knowledge and tools used by practitioners in CR. Although this course explores details of the CR strategy implementation, it is designed to link CR to the overall business drivers and is therefore relevant for any potential corporate manager or consultant. A strategically relevant CR program must seek to build on the values of CR to the business and the business' stakeholders. Therefore, this course is structured around the top values that CR can bring to a business. Once we identify the ‘value pathway', we explore tools (standards, guidelines, benchmarks, certifications, analytic tools, etc) and metrics available to measure performance against those tools in order to achieve that value. The course relies heavily on class discussions through case studies, debates, hypothesis testing, role playing and student presentations. The course is split into six (6) sections - each representing a CR Value Pathway. Each Section will be comprised of 2 sessions during which we will discuss key dilemmas associated with the value pathway, discuss tools, metrics and indicators available to address the dilemma and then explore a business case study through student discussions.",Todd Cort,6:10pm,8:00pm,60816,Morningside,K4370-20152-001,IMP CORP SUST STRATEGIES,School of Professional Studies,SUMA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212030527/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K4370-20152-001/,603 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

SUMA K4380,FINANCING NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE,"This course is offered through the School of Professional Studies. 
""Natural infrastructure""-the use of natural or engineered ecosystems and natural areas to provide services that could be provided through ""grey infrastructure""-has received increasing attention as an alternative to traditional engineering solutions to protect water supplies, reduce flood risks, manage stormwater, and provide clean air. In addition, conservation is seen as a means of providing sustainable food supplies in response to increasing demand. While ""greening"" infrastructure is one aspect of the solution, a critical need is finding new ways to finance the construction and operation of our infrastructure in general. This course will explore the potential for natural infrastructure to address-in place of or in conjunction with grey infrastructure-many of the challenges that we face and the financing tools that could be utilized to accelerate and take to scale its adoption. The course will draw heavily from ""real-world"" examples in cities, corporations, financial institutions, and national and subnational governments that have utilized natural infrastructure and/or innovative financing mechanisms to meet their needs. Through a mix of lectures, case studies, problem sets, and guest lectures, students will gain the skills needed to quantify the value of ecosystem services and understand how private investment and financial mechanisms could accelerate the use of natural infrastructure.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,62279,Morningside,K4380-20152-001,FINANCING NATURAL INFASTRUCTUR,School of Professional Studies,SUMA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212030528/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K4380-20152-001/,405 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

WRIT S4308,SHORT PROSE FORMS,"How short can a story be? Can we create the beauty and richness of a novel in a piece that is as short as a sentence, at the most only a page or two? In this course, we'll explore what we can (and can't ) do in work that is under 2,000 words as we look at the increasingly popular and innovative form of the ""short short""-prose poems, flash fiction and brief (very brief) personal essays under 2,000 words. The form offers the writer the chance to hone in on and focus on their craft, by paying close attention to detail, language, character, voice and tone, while also creating work that is immediate, urgent and often extraordinarily innovative. Students will write and discuss short pieces that may be fragments, moments or lists, surreal or dreamlike, traditional or experimental, but are always, as the author Jayne Anne Phillips says, ""Fast, precise, over. And not over. The one-page fiction should hang in the air of the mind like an image made of smoke."" This course is primarily a workshop, so students will write 3-4 pieces (in and out of class), and we'll also read and discuss short pieces by Samuel Beckett, Jorge Luis Borges, Mavis Gallant, Dave Eggers, Christine Schutt, Jamaica Kincaid, Michael Ondaatje, and Lydia Davis.",Rebecca Godfrey,3:00pm,5:10pm,12250,Morningside,S4308-20152-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212031550/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4308-20152-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4313,WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS,"There are many misconceptions as to what makes an appealing story for children and how to get a story published. Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",Peter Catalanotto,5:30pm,7:40pm,72198,Morningside,S4313-20152-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Catalanotto,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212031551/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4313-20152-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer?  What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia?   In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed.   From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",David Farley,5:30pm,7:40pm,28857,Morningside,S4320-20152-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212031552/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4320-20152-001/,511 Kent Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4323,Writing the Young Adult Novel,"Young adult fiction is a popular and still-growing  category in book publishing that encompasses all  genres—fantasy, paranormal, romance, historical,  science fiction, dystopian, coming-of-age realism,  literary fiction, and more. YA books are written for a  core audience of teenagers, but their reach often  crosses over to adult readers. In this class, students  will embark on writing their own YA novels. Each  student’s work will be critiqued in weekly writing  workshops, with the discussion focusing on guiding  each writer to find the best way to tell his or her  story. With an eye always on our own work, we will  discuss craft issues including voice, POV, character,  style, plotting, and more.  There also will be weekly  discussions of the work of current YA novelists  including Laurie Halse Anderson, Libba Bray, David  Levithan, and more. The emphasis, however, will be  on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will  write up to three chapters of an original YA novel  along with a partial outline for their book in progress.  The class will include a visit from published YA  authors who will speak about craft, audience, and  getting published.",Nova Ren Suma,11:00am,1:10pm,13196,Morningside,S4323-20152-001,Writing Young Adult Novel,Writing,WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Ren_Suma,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212031554/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20152-001/,522D Kent Hall,,"Columbia College

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Adam Z Wilson,2:00pm,4:10pm,19946,Morningside,S4810-20152-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160212031557/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4810-20152-001/,405 Kent Hall,,"Barnard
