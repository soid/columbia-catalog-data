ADVR PS0101,Digital Media and Advertising,"Digital media has surpassed television to become the most important way for marketers to reach and influence consumers. While television advertising represents just one method of affecting consumer sentiment (video ads), digital is far more complex, offering video, search, social, email, and more.  In this introductory course, students will learn how marketers leverage digital media to promote and sell products. Students will come to understand the inner workings of multiple digital media platforms (e.g., search, video, display, gaming, et al.) and the strategies and tactics marketers employ to influence consumers. In addition, students will explore the ethics of big data and privacy, as well as develop an understanding of how marketers use digital media to influence consumers.  The course culminates with a final project presentation which allow students to put into practice topics and theories about digital media and advertising covered during the course.  This course has no prerequisites and is appropriate for anyone interested in the fields of marketing and media, as well as those interested in the topic of persuasion and how corporations influence consumer behavior.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,10651,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Digital Media and Adverti,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ADVR,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ADVR/K0101-20222-001/,644 Seeley W.

AHIS OC3431,CONTEMPORARY ART AT THE BIENNALE,"Prerequisites: None  Instructor: Alexander Alberro  This course introduces the relationship between contemporary artistic practices and the 2019 Venice Biennale. The Biennale has become one of the most important international contemporary art fairs. This course will expose students to the historical, political, and cultural developments linked to the biennale from its inception in 1895 to present day. In addition to regular class meetings with slide lectures and seminar-style discussion in the classroom, students will visit exhibition spaces located in the historical pavilions of the giardini (fair gardens), the arsenale (a 16th century warehouse space now used to host sections of this contemporary art installations), and other temporary venues located throughout the city as we investigate not only the art, but also the unique spaces in which we encounter it. Beyond a focus on the history of the Venice Biennale, the course will introduce some of the key concepts of contemporary art as they have developed in the past three or so decades.

AHIS S2314,MASTERS OF THE BAROQUE,"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art—Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Velázquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)—artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",Lindsey P Schneider,1:00pm,4:10pm,10224,Morningside,S2314-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S2314-20222-001/,832 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20222AHIS2314S001,LECTURE

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

AHIS S3441,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MUSEUM,"This course will introduce students to the history of museums and display practices through New York collections. The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts.

AMPO PS0101,Wealth and Democracy in the United State,"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.  Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and/or national level.  Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.  In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",Geoffrey C Upton,3:10pm,5:00pm,10652,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Wealth and Democracy in t,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),AMPO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMPO/K0101-20222-001/,307 Uris Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222AMPO0101K001,LECTURE

Due to the nature of the content in this course, it is recommended for mature students who are willing to examine these questions with an open and reflective approach that requires a respectful attitude towards different opinions and their instructor and classmates.",Alba I Lamar,3:10pm,5:00pm,11007,Morningside,K0202-20222-001,Confronting American-isms,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),AMST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMST/K0202-20222-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222AMST0202K001,LECTURE

ANTH S3921,ANTI-COLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, Aimé Cesairé’s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi’s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,1:00pm,4:10pm,10177,Morningside,S3921-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3921-20222-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,TR,20222ANTH3921S001,SEMINAR

We will focus on textual and visual material, primarily ethnographies and films, to provide a critique of normative representations of the 'South Asian woman'. These readings will be used to reveal the complex social and historical configurations that institute and obscure gendered experiences and representations within the colonial imagination and their colonized others. A significant motif of this course will be to develop alternative ways of knowing and understanding gender construction, sexual relations, and community formation in South Asia.",Sonia Ahsan,1:00pm,4:10pm,11439,Morningside,S4187-20222-001,WOMEN & GENDER IN SOUTH A,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S4187-20222-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,MW,20222ANTH4187S001,LECTURE
ANTH UN3751,Personhood,"This seminar seeks to engage with materials that question personhood. Drawing on both fictional and non-fictional accounts, we will be involved with textual and visual documents as well institutional contexts in order to revisit such notion under contemporary capitalism. We will cover topics like rites of passage and life cycle, the role of the nation state and local communities in defining a person, the relation between self and non-self, between the living and the dead. We will likewise address vicarious forms of personhood through the prosthetic, the avatar or the heteronomous. But we will also look into forms of dissipation and/or enhancement of personhood through bodybuilding, guinea-piging and pharmo-toxicities. As a whole, the course will bring to light how the question of personhood cross-culturally relates to language, performativity, religion, technology, law, gender, race, class, care, life and death.",Maria Jose de Abreu,12:00pm,4:00pm,10370,Morningside,W3751-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/W3751-20222-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,4,,MW,20222ANTH3751W001,SEMINAR

 This course introduces students to cloud computing concepts and practices ranging from infrastructure and administration to services and applications. The course is primarily focused on the development of practical skills in utilizing cloud services to build distributed and scalable analytics applications. Students will have hands-on exposure to VMs (Virtual Machines), databases, storage, microservices, and AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) services through Google Cloud Platform, et al.  Cost and performance characteristics of alternative approaches will also be studied. Topics include: overview of cloud computing, cloud systems, parallel processing in the cloud, distributed storage systems, virtualization, security in the cloud, and multicore operating systems. Throughout, students will study state-of-the-art solutions for cloud computing developed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.
 
 The course modules provide a blend of lecture and reading materials along with class exercises and programming assignments. While extensive programming experience is not required, students taking the course are expected to possess basic Python 3 programming skills.

APAR PS0102,Understanding the Arts: Art History and,"A two-course curricular option for students wishing to develop their appreciation of art and architecture. Both courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis, skills that will be valuable to students in whatever fields they choose to pursue in college and beyond. Numerous field trips to museums and architectural landmarks throughout the city enable students to take advantage of New York’s vast cultural resources.  
What is Art History?
 
 This course introduces students to selected monuments of painting, sculpture, and architecture and to basic trends and concepts in the history of art. Examples are drawn from a wide range of periods and cultures. Students are introduced to aspects of visual analysis, historical context, and problems of interpretation. Participants engage in discussions centered around slide presentations, videos, and, most importantly, field trips.  One of the objectives of the course is to consider how the way art is displayed can enhance or detract from its power. To this end the class visits sites such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hispanic Society, the Cloisters, the Frick Collection, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art.  
What is Architecture?
 
 An introduction to ways of understanding architecture framed around four topics: Concept, Context, Form, and Materials. Students are challenged to examine and understand the effect of physical environment on human experience, the factors that influence architectural forms, and the role that architecture plays in shaping our behaviors and civic cultures.  Students will gain an understanding of architecture through slide presentations, discussions, readings, visits to museum exhibits, and on-site observations and analyses of architecture and public spaces in New York City, both iconic and lesser-known. Past field trip destinations have included the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Lincoln Center, Times Square, and the Highline, a public park built on a former elevated railway.",,1:10pm,4:00pm,10653,Morningside,K0102-20222-001,Understanding the Arts,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),APAR,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/APAR/K0102-20222-001/,401 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222APAR0102K001,LECTURE

APRW PS0101,"Core Skills Fundamentals: Reading, Writi","This course is designed for rising freshmen and sophomores who are interested in honing skills that are at the core of advanced study in high school and college. Classroom environments are intimate and collaborative, and students learn by engaging actively with the subject matter, the instructors, and their peers. The focus throughout is on learning to think clearly, critically, and creatively.  
Expository Writing
  The process of writing is emphasized as students learn to write through a ""building block approach"" which concentrates on how relatively simple-meaning relationships and rhetorical strategies within an essay combine to yield intricate and sophisticated results. Attention is paid to developing skills in grammar, diction, usage, syntax, and punctuation.  
Critical Reading
  Analyzing fiction and nonfiction trains students to identify and critically respond to the messages conveyed by different kinds of writing. Emphasis is placed on understanding how formal characteristics such as rhetorical strategy, point of view, and diction condition the reader's perception of content.  
Academic Skills
  In conjunction with writing and reading exercises, students also acquire techniques for effective study and research. Study skill sessions and tutorials teach practical skills such as note-taking, outlining, summarizing, managing time, and using research tools. Toward the end of the session, each student delivers an oral presentation, thereby honing public speaking and presentation skills.",Anne E Summers,1:10pm,3:00pm,11004,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Core Skills Fundamentals,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),APRW,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/APRW/K0101-20222-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

ARAR PS0101,Looking at Architecture: A Primer on Sty,"This course introduces students to the major historical styles of architecture in the Western hemisphere, with a consideration of notable examples from the East. Stylistic models from both the recent and ancient past have influenced how buildings look today. Likewise, social changes have shaped the way we inhabit the built environment. Understanding architecture in a historic context can enrich our experience of traveling, or of merely walking down the street where we live. It helps us connect our personal spaces and neighborhoods to places and cultures from different times, geographies, and cultures.  Participants learn to recognize and describe the formal characteristics of architecture broadly described as Classical, Medieval, Victorian, Modernist, and Postmodernist, while recognizing that few buildings are designed in a “pure” or exclusive idiom. We analyze historic and modern images of buildings which exemplify the most recognizable styles of each era, both in the United States and abroad. When possible, we visit New York city sites whose architecture represents or evokes one or more styles under discussion.",Nenette Arroyo,3:10pm,5:00pm,10654,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Architecture: Primer on S,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ARAR,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ARAR/K0101-20222-001/,316 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222ARAR0101K001,LECTURE

Does making art out of trauma lead to exploitation of the self? Does exploitation of the self lead to empowerment? How have feminist artists navigated systems meant to oppress them, and can they operate within these systems successfully? We will explore how the trauma informed personal story can be utilized for art making, fame building, accumulation of resources and healing, and how this can be both beneficial and compromised.

Next we take up the nature of light, the structure of matter, the emission and absorption of light by matter, and nuclear physics. We apply this knowledge to describe the properties of our sun and of the planets of our solar system, the properties and fate of stars in general, and the discovery of planets around other stars. Further topics include galaxies and the dark matter and black holes they contain, supernovae and the creation of chemical elements, and the expansion of the universe. We end with Einsteinian cosmology, the cosmic microwave background, dark energy, and the fate of the universe.",James H Applegate,9:10am,11:00am,11000,Morningside,N0102-20222-001,Astronomy and Astrophysic,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ASTO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ASTO/N0102-20222-001/,329 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222ASTO0102N001,LECTURE

BCAB PS0101,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, AI, and Be","This course is designed for students who have an interest in the future of finance, technology, blockchain, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and work. Beginning with an exploration of Fintech (financial technology), we explore technology’s impact on everything from banking to real estate to Wall Street. Additionally, we look at how artificial intelligence (AI) will automate and reduce the need for human workers, as AI, Fintech, and other technologies are combined to automate many tasks.  After gaining a solid understanding of the real-world use cases of Fintech and the everyday ways it impacts the economy, social justice, and our lives, students take a journey of discovery into the world of AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, cryptocurrency and decentralized ledger technology, aka blockchain, have emerged as an economic force majeure, disrupting the fundamentals of how people interact and how they perceive money. In addition to pushing the evolution of money, blockchain technology is now poised to disrupt how we organize businesses and the future of work. Course participants explore the organizational impacts and transformations caused by blockchain and cryptocurrencies and examine what this will mean to them as future CEOs and global business and thought leaders.  The course concludes by exploring the perspective of entrepreneurs and innovators, further examining how technologies come together to form the businesses, disruptions, and methodologies of the 21st Century. Participants walk away with a fundamental understanding of what tokens and cryptocurrencies are; how businesses leverage blockchain technology, AI, and other Fintech applications; and how digital transformation impacts social interactions and the future of work.  
Please note: This course is not a computer programming course and requires no prior knowledge or experience, but rather looks at these emerging technologies more broadly from business, social, political, and cultural perspectives.",Lindsley Medlin,1:10pm,3:00pm,10966,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,"Blockchain, Crypto, AI &",Pre-College Programs (SHSP),BCAB,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BCAB/N0101-20222-001/,141 Uris Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222BCAB0101N001,LECTURE

In this course, through formal lectures and hands-on wet lab activities students gain an appreciation for the role of engineering in performing biological research.  We focus on how biomedical engineering modeling systems are used to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms through which cells in the human body respond to physical stimuli (chemical, electrical, mechanical). This information can then be directed toward the development of cell-based therapies and regenerative medicine strategies, such as functional tissue engineering, for tissue and organ repair.  Intensive lab sessions, making up half of the course, take place in the Department of Biomedical Engineering’s undergraduate laboratory, which contains facilities for cell and tissue culture, microscopy, and data and image analysis.

BIET PS5360,CHALLENGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL BIOETHICS,"The environment affects human health and well-being, and current health-care technology can impact the environment. Thus, questions about how humans ought to relate both to their own environment and to other living beings on this planet fall squarely within the field of bioethics. While some observers may see bioethics as concerning only the health of human beings defined narrowly, bioethics in fact has many implications for the larger biosphere and vice versa.   This course discusses important issues at the nexus of bioethics and the environment, including climate change, ozone shield depletion, soil erosion, ocean pollution, diminishing biodiversity-all among the environmental factors with adverse consequences for the health of both human and non-human beings. Even the technologies employed in health-
care 
have environmental impact harmful 
to 
health.  Among the challenges to be addressed: How can healthcare be made “green”?  What do present generations “owe” to future generations? What is environmental justice in the relations between developed and developing societies?

BLOK PS0101,"Understanding Blockchain, AI, and Machin","This course provides an overview of the world of blockchain, AI, and machine learning. We explore artificial intelligence and machine learning and seek to understand the philosophical and ethical issues, relationship with consciousness and self-awareness, the categories and applications of the different families of AI algorithms, and what challenges and opportunities lie in the future. We then open the hood and look inside blockchain to see what it is, how it has evolved, and where it is headed, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We examine how these technologies will impact the future of work.

BUFE PS0303,The Future of the Space Economy,"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other leading investment firms have predicted that the space economy will be worth trillions of dollars within the next few decades. In this course we explore a number of key issues having to do with the space industry and the emerging space economy with the intention of preparing participants to be leaders in those fields.  Potential topics to be covered include:  
  
How private businesses are changing the new space race
  
Why space commercialization will lead to a Fifth Industrial Revolution
  
What old and new financial models are enabling the growth of space technology
  
The role of NASA, the Space Force, NOAA, and other government agencies
  
Should we be investing in space when there are so many challenges facing humanity on Earth?
  
How do businesses profit from working within the space economy?
  
What does the work of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin tell us about opportunities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the moon, and Mars?
  
What steps a business must go through to be part of the new space race
  
How new private and national programs will add to the complexity and vibrancy of the economy
  
What is the role of space in human rights?
  
How does the improvement of communities in space lead to social and technology improvements?
  
What environmental problems can be solved using space technology?
  
What is the role of traditional financial institutions such as banks and mutual funds, and how does that compare to the role of family private offices, VCs, and hedge funds in disruptive industries like the space economy?
 
  The course draws on fundamental concepts in business, economics, and finance and applies new concepts from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, risk management, and social impact measurements. Participants gain a foundational understanding of business development, the importance of intellectual property, and the value of community building as part of any business strategy - how solving for space is really about solving for problems on Earth. Guest speakers represent the private sector as well as groups such as NASA, the Space Force, and international space organizations.  Students leave with the tools to place an economic lens on the business, technology, and financing of spaceports, the aerospace industry, space adjacent technology, and the space economy as a whole.

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

CINT PS0101,Cyber-Threat Intelligence,"Each year cybercriminals steal hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of information from major companies and vital national security secrets from governments, while terrorist organizations leverage cyber-networks for distributing their media and recruiting. It is imperative to nurture the next generation of intelligence professionals to understand the cyber-threat landscape given its ubiquitous impact on our daily lives.  In this course participants are exposed to cyber-threat intelligence as a discipline and its function in providing decision-makers with the support they need to stay abreast of evolving security challenges. Case studies on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and large cybercrime networks are examined so as to better understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); their successes; and their shortcomings. Further, we look at technology’s evolution and how it is integrated into our lives along with the likely future threat landscape that accompanies these technologies.  Threat intelligence encompasses more than the government, considering all private companies are reliant on technology and have their own threat intelligence teams, so this course focuses on both the public and private sectors.  Course readings cover the topics of intelligence, analysis, advanced persistent threat groups, cybercriminals, terrorist organizations, and the different methods these actors use to conduct their attacks and operations. We discuss these topics in greater depth in class lectures and with guest speakers. Students produce short white papers and work on group presentations in which they represent threat intel teams focusing on particular entities.

CLCV UN3059,WORLDS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT,"This seminar looks at the narrative and the historical context for an extraordinary event: the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander III of Macedonia, conventionally known as “Alexander the Great”. We will explore the different worlds Alexander grew out of, confronted, and affected: the old Greek world, the Persian empire, the ancient near-east (Egypt, Levant, Babylonia, Iran), and the worlds beyond, namely pre-Islamic (and pre-Silk Road) Central Asia, the Afghan borderlands, and the Indus valley. The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",Lien Van Geel,9:00am,12:10pm,10065,Morningside,W3059-20222-001,WORLDS OF ALEXANDER THE G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLCV/W3059-20222-001/,613 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222CLCV3059W001,SEMINAR
CLEN S3682,Human Rights in World Literature and Vis,"This course explores contemporary human rights issues in fiction, nonfiction, and film from Africa, Latin America, South Asia, the Caribbean, and the U.S., as well as humanitarian-inspired art, documentaries, television, and music circulated around the world. When decolonial and indigenous writers and cultural workers decide to represent violence in their countries, they risk reproducing racist stereotypes that permeate international media. And yet, human rights violations tied to war, slavery, sexual violence, religious fundamentalism, and ethnic strife are central features of turbulent national histories—including our own in America. How can twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers from the Global South and beyond undermine the harmful stereotypes and dominant narratives that predetermine their stories in the international public sphere without reproducing stereotypes? To better understand strife abroad, we will take an interdisciplinary feminist approach to the politics of representing human rights. Our readings, paired with options for extracurricular events like film screenings in New York City, will prompt us to reflect critically on the ambivalences surrounding human rights in global culture. We will engage literary representations of historical events ranging from the Holocaust to the Vietnam War and the Rwandan genocide, all the way up to extremism in our present moment. Final projects invite students to reflect on methods for representing human rights through creative writing. This course, which fulfills the University Global Core requirement, as well as English major requirements for prose fiction/narrative and comparative/global literature, will appeal to students of not only literature but also in human rights, history, political science, African studies, law, and gender and sexuality studies.",Nicole M Gervasio,1:00pm,4:10pm,12074,Morningside,S3682-20222-001,Human Rights in World Lit,Summer Session (SUMM),CLEN,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/S3682-20222-001/,317 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222CLEN3682S001,SEMINAR
CLFR OC3821,CITY DIPLOMACY,"Prerequisites: 
None.  
Eligibility: 
This course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students.  Based on a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, the city diplomacy course is designed to offer a general introduction to the international role of cities.  With its century-old history, city diplomacy represents a relatively recent dynamics in international relations. City diplomacy is generally considered to start in 1913 with the creation, at the Universal Exposition in the Belgian city of Ghent, of the first global city network, the Union Internationale des Villes.  Since its beginning, city diplomacy emerged as a field where cities’ values and idealism are implemented through a pragmatic and cooperative approach that progressively expanded its scope. The rise of such practice was driven by the desire to foster reconciliation among former enemies of the Second World War through direct interaction between residents in the framework of twinning agreements. A few years later, city diplomacy accompanied the process of decolonization by creating a solid bond of friendship between cities in former colonizing and colonized countries. In the 90s, city diplomacy widened its scope to include enhancing the city’s positioning in the global economy. Today, city diplomacy is best known for its impact in addressing the main transnational challenges (including climate change, migration, violent extremism, and urbanization) through a methodology featuring horizontal partnerships with cities from all over the world and a vertical, participatory approach engaging and empowering residents and local stakeholders.  Through an innovative approach cutting cuts across the boundaries of traditional disciplines (international relations, urban sociology, area studies, history, geography),  the course will combine the emerging scholarly literature with a comparative accent linked to the analysis of primary sources from cities and international actors from all regions of the world. As a result, students will learn to connect global and regional macro-dynamics with micro-transformations at the local level, while gaining an in-depth understanding of city diplomacy's core features, management, tangible impact, and evolution.

CLMS PS0100,Global Climate Change and Public Policy,"Climate change is one of the world’s most critical challenges, and though quite prominent in today’s news it remains a complex and multifaceted issue. What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?  Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.  Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).  Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers. Students are expected and encouraged to participate in class discussions, raise questions, and contribute to small group exercises and presentations.",Michael Bennett,1:10pm,3:00pm,10671,Morningside,K0100-20222-002,Global Climate Change & P,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),CLMS,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLMS/K0100-20222-002/,601B Sherman Fairchild Life Sciences Building,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222CLMS0100K002,LECTURE

COLP PS0220,Core Skills for College and Beyond: Read,"Intended for students who are already strong academically, this curricular option enables rising juniors and seniors to hone the core skills necessary to thrive not only at top-caliber American universities but also in any intellectually demanding profession and in their personal life. Classroom environments are intimate and collaborative, and students learn by actively engaging with the subject matter, the instructor, and their peers. The emphasis throughout is on using reading, writing, and research as tools for thinking clearly and critically.  
Close Reading and Critical Thinking
  Students learn to identify and critically evaluate the intellectual content, both explicit and implied, of what they read and see. We read sophisticated texts and analyze them, identifying rhetorical strategies, unstated assumptions, and hidden subtexts. We examine a variety of literary genres such as essays, fiction, poetry, journalism, and speeches; time permitting, we branch out into visual forms such as painting, graphic novels, and film. Participants become not only more insightful readers but also more nuanced thinkers.  
Writing and Research Skills
  Students are provided an overview of the techniques essential for successful academic writing, with particular emphasis placed on argumentation and organization. While reviewing the basic components of strong writing through discussion of argument structure, essay organization, style, and mechanics, we also engage in creative activities and discussions aimed at strengthening analytic and rhetorical skills. Students also learn the fundamentals of scholarly research, with special attention given to library and online resources, source evaluation, and bibliographic format.

COMM PS5270,CONTENT STRATEGY,"Sitting at the intersection of business strategy, digital development, user experience, communication, and publishing, content strategy has emerged over the last few years as a discipline examining the purpose behind content (in all manifestations) and how it supports business, organizational, and user goals. While it originated in digital web design and user experience, content strategy now encompasses a much broader set of considerations and addresses content creation, distribution, and governance across multiple channels, especially the interplay among digital, social, and traditional media. Content strategy provides a holistic approach for unlocking the value behind content and for increasing its effectiveness in achieving business and organizational objectives. This course will present the fundamentals of content strategy and explore the discipline’s approaches, techniques, and tools that course participants can apply directly to the content situation in their own organization. It will draw parallels with – and highlight distinctions among – traditional communication strategy, publishing, and content strategy, and provide students with a framework to create a sustainable program grounded in meaningful, actionable content.",Jenny M Fernandez,6:10pm,8:00pm,10520,Morningside,K5270-20222-001,,Strategic Communication,COMM,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMM/K5270-20222-001/,303 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20222COMM5270K001,LECTURE

COMO PS0101,Geometric Topology: A Tool for Modeling,"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don’t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds — structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works — creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",Joseph Quinn,3:10pm,5:00pm,10687,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Geometric Topology: Unive,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),COMO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMO/K0101-20222-001/,407 Mathematics Building,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222COMO0101K001,LECTURE

Writing a personal essay is not only a process of self-discovery—it is also the work of becoming the person capable of writing the essay.  In this course, we learn to write true stories about ourselves, the cultural artifacts and places we care about, the identities we hold in relation to power, and the ways our experiences change us forever. With the goal of producing up to three compelling personal essays, we explore the process of personal writing, from generating ideas to revising drafts. To become captivating narrators, we practice drafting skills essential to all nonfiction writing, drawing from reporting, research, and our personal archives—be it text messages, photos, or journals—to enhance the emotional specificity and intellectual rigor of our personal narratives.

DEBA PS0101,Contemporary Debates in American Law and,"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the “front lines” of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.  A primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.  By the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders.

For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production participants learn how to work in a group to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production they work together to coordinate and shoot their script. And finally in post-production they edit and polish their projects. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.  The emphasis throughout the three weeks is on collaborative teamwork. Over the course of the various exercises, each student takes on a number of different roles within the production teams (director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor, sound). For the final projects, only a handful of proposals are selected for production, so not every participant directs or writes his or her own film, though everyone plays a crucial role in the production.  On the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants. The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",Yu Cheng,3:10pm,5:00pm,10691,Morningside,N0207-20222-001,Digital Filmmaking,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DIFI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DIFI/N0207-20222-001/,307 Uris Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222DIFI0207N001,LECTURE

DRAW PS0100,Drawing Intensive: Developing a Portfoli,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  This course is aimed at developing a series of foundational drawings for a fine arts college-application portfolio.  Students explore various approaches to drawing from both observation and imagination while focusing on conceptually creative assignments. Each session develops the students’ approach to various materials, composition, and personal narratives into completed works that can be used for a final portfolio. Students have prolonged time to study and sketch the human figure from live nude models in class. Ideas are explored through assigned writings and developed in a sketchbook throughout the course.  A visit to a museum or gallery is scheduled as part of the course so as to facilitate discussion of relevant art historical concepts as well as contemporary approaches to drawing.  Lastly, participants learn how to prepare and digitally document works into a final portfolio for college applications.",Ioana I Manolache,1:10pm,4:00pm,10704,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,Drawing:Developing a Port,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DRAW,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DRAW/K0100-20222-001/,501 Dodge Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222DRAW0100K001,STUDIO

Taemong
 (birth dreams) of Korea to the sofas of Freud and Jung to contemporary Yanomami shamans and Hollywood’s 
Dreamworks
, throughout a vast array of cultures and eras, dreams have been a source of inspiration, healing, and insight. In this course we aim to reconnect with the imaginative power of dreams primarily by writing and interpreting our own, while reading extensively in dream literature.  While composing and sharing our own dreams on a daily basis with foremost attention to dreams as a source for discovery and literary artistic production, we experiment with a variety of compositional, mnemonic, and lucid techniques. Readings and audio-visual texts from writers, theorists, and filmmakers such as Patricia Garfield, Jeremy Seligson, Robert Moss (especially his “six masters of the ‘three only things’”), Joan of Arc, Lucrecia de León, Harriet Tubman, Mark Twain, Wolfgang Pauli, Winston Churchill, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Richard Linklater provide guidance and inspiration.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,10705,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DREA,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DREA/N0101-20222-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

ECON GU4301,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOPMNT I,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213. Economic development is a complex and multifaceted process. Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 /day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",Palaash Bhargava,1:00pm,4:10pm,10048,Morningside,G4301-20222-001,ECONOMIC GROWTH & DEVELOP,Summer Session (SUMM),ECON,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/G4301-20222-001/,627 Seeley W.

EESC GR5415,An Introduction to Complex Climate Risks,"Extreme climate and weather events can lead to cascading failures that can spread within and across socio-environmental systems and sectors, often disproportionally affecting underserved communities. Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent, and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a  changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent,  synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies,  from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.   This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world events in which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year-long with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighborhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.   Guided by recent literature quantitative and qualitative frameworks that aim at assessing current and future climate risks to turn them into a",Kai Kornhuber,3:30pm,5:00pm,12314,Morningside,G5415-20222-001,Intro to Complex Climate,Summer Session (SUMM),EESC,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/G5415-20222-001/,417 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,1.5,,TR,20222EESC5415G001,LECTURE

EESC S5408,CAPSTONE WORKSHOP IN CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"In this course, students will work jointly with a client organization in the climate and society field. Under the guidance of the instructors, they will take a short request from the organization for a specific product (data analysis, program development, curricular and training material, or other related items), develop a work plan, implement the work plan, and present the final product to the client. This course gives students direct experience in the co-production of knowledge in the climate and society field, a valuable skill in the contemporary world. It extends the training in the integration of natural science and social science that is a hallmark of the Climate + Society program. It includes training in the construction of a boundary object--a final product--conducted jointly with the client organization; this training includes instruction in project design, implementation and evaluation, and in communication between organizations.",,,,10316,Morningside,S5408-20222-001,CAPSTONE WORKSHOP,Summer Session (SUMM),EESC,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/S5408-20222-001/,,In-Person,,6,,,20222EESC5408S001,WORKSHOP

EIPD PS0201,Entrepreneurship & Innovation: New Produ,"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.  With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University’s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.  Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.  Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another’s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",Michelle Greenwald,1:10pm,3:00pm,10934,Morningside,N0201-20222-001,Entrepreneurship & Innova,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),EIPD,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EIPD/N0201-20222-001/,702 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222EIPD0201N001,LECTURE

ELAW EL7041,Negotiations,"The Negotiation Workshop provides students with an experiential, simulation-based introduction to the theory and practice of negotiation. The course will consider such topics as integrative and distributive bargaining; barriers to agreement and ways to overcome them; negotiation skills such as listening, communication, and persuasion; the determinants of bargaining power; client relationships; negotiation ethics; and the role of culture, gender, and race in negotiation. Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in role plays, to keep a weekly journal in which they analyze their negotiation experiences, and to participate in a final project comprising a 60 to 90-minute one-on-one negotiation and a 10 page written analysis of that negotiation.   Because of the experiential and team-based nature of the coursework, class attendance is required. If you anticipate missing more than one class session, you should not take the course. Unanticipated absences due to illness or similar supervening circumstances will be accommodated as is reasonable; makeup activities may be required as part of the accommodation.

ENGL BC1902,GLOBAL QUEER CINEMAS,"In this class, we will focus on contemporary queer cinema from around the world to explore how filmmakers create new visual modes of representing queerness, and how these queer cinematic narratives are informed by various local, national, cultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do the particularities of various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers and artists create a visual aesthetic based on their local contexts that is distinct from westernized visual narratives of queerness? How do images of queerness circulate globally and how might queer visual cultures of the Global South push back against existing paradigms of queerness in the Global North? All films for the course are subject to change, but may include titles such as 
Rafiki, A Fantastic Woman, Happy Together, The Wound, Portrait of a Lady on Fire. 
Additionally, we will read critical and theoretical works that will urge us to consider these films from a range of perspectives, such as queer studies, feminist film studies, disability studies, and transgender studies.",Duygu Ula,1:00pm,4:10pm,00004,Barnard College,X1902-20222-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/X1902-20222-001/,502 Diana Center,,,3,,TR,20222ENGL1902X001,SEMINAR

On the other, her husband’s virginal, naive, and beautiful daughter – whose own mother is usually dead. The conflict between them is so familiar that it feels inevitable. Where, though, did these nearly universal figures come from? Why are they so ingrained in the imaginations of people around the world and across the millennia? In this course, we’ll explore the roots of the maternal in folk and fairy tales. We’ll analyze a variety of stories and films to investigate the “absent mother,” “virginal daughter,” and “wicked stepmother” from different critical perspectives, paying special attention to analytical psychology and feminist psychoanalytic theories, to try to figure out why these figures are so compelling, so ubiquitous, and so hard to shake.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,00005,Barnard College,X1903-20222-001,DEAD MOTHER-WICKED STEPMO,Pre-College Program (Barnard),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/X1903-20222-001/,306 Milbank Hall (Barnard),,,3,,TR,20222ENGL1903X001,SEMINAR

You will write three types of essays in this class, all of which will center personal experience as valuable evidence of larger phenomena or patterns. Your essays will build in complexity, as you introduce more types of sources into conversation about your topics as the semester goes on. You will hone your skills of observing, describing, questioning, analyzing, and persuading. You will be challenged to confront complications and to craft nuanced explorations of your topics. We will also regularly read and discuss the work of contemporary published essayists, identifying key writerly moves that you may adapt as you attempt your own essays.  You will have many opportunities throughout the semester to brainstorm ideas, receive feedback from me and your peers, and develop and revise your drafts.

ENGL S3233,SHAKESPEARE,"This course provides an introduction to Shakespeare through a combination of reading his plays and viewing them in performance. On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",,1:00pm,4:10pm,10275,Morningside,S3233-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3233-20222-001/,330 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222ENGL3233S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,10276,Morningside,S3273-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3273-20222-001/,303 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3376,REVOLUTIONS IN TEXT AND TECHNOLOGY,"New media is nothing new. New media historians trace rich record of the moments when some new textual technology entered the public sphere and provoked responses ranging from widespread anxiety and to revolutionary fervor. We will examine the cultural anxieties that attend new media, stretching from Plato’s 
Phaedrus
—where Socrates warns that the advent of writing will destroy people’s memories—to today, when Nicholas Carr asks “Is Google making us stupid?” The clay tablet, the codex, the printing press, the chalkboard, the telegraph, the typewriter, the pdf, computer coding, and the smart phone have each promised to revolutionize the reading and writing publics, access to power, and even how people think.  This course examines those promises within their historical contexts, through critical study, and using hands-on experiences. For instance, we will study the role of clay tablets in upholding ancient empires at the same time that we craft our own clay tablet texts. We will take notes with ink pens while we study the role of Medieval scribes in spreading Christianity and Islam. We will create ‘zines while studying the Riot Grrl movement. And we will create our own html hypertexts (no prior coding experience required) as we read the earliest hypertext fiction. These hands-on experiences move arguments about the dangers and revelations of writing technologies out of the realm of the hypothetical and into the realm of the experiential.  The class will visit Columbia’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library (RBML) and Barnard’s Zine Archive, where we will look at textual artifacts, from ancient papyri to early print and digital texts. Our approach will prepare you to situate the contemporary textual technologies you take for granted (IMs, Twitter, Google Docs, and so on) within the long history of new media. And it will teach those pursuing literary studies, new media studies, and computer science research methods required to examine a text as a technology.",Susan Mendelsohn,9:00am,12:10pm,10299,Morningside,S3376-20222-001,REVOLUTIONS IN TEXT AND T,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3376-20222-001/,306 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222ENGL3376S001,SEMINAR

We will talk about the pleasures of those texts, as well as their formal and generic features, their language and their relation to literary history.  But we will also discuss the idea and institution named “Sally Rooney,” considering it as what Michel Foucault called an “author function,” or what Pierre Bourdieu dubbed a “space of possibilities” within the literary field.  Our inquiry into “Sally Rooney” will, therefore, also be an inquiry into the meaning of literary authorship in the twenty-first century. Through secondary readings in criticism and theory, we will engage longstanding arguments about the relation between critical interpretation and authorial intention, as well as between social and historical “context” and authorial and aesthetic autonomy. We will examine how patterns of social exclusion — in this case, race — define the digitally-mediated literary field of the present. And we will ask how the rise of social media and online retail have altered ideas and institutions of authorship, audience, and literariness.",Matthew Hart,1:00pm,4:10pm,10298,Morningside,S3693-20222-001,SALLY ROONEY,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3693-20222-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222ENGL3693S001,SEMINAR
ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order):

In addition to the explicit echoes between these books, each work is interested in the relationship between the natural world and human beings; gender difference, relations between the sexes, and the reproduction of human life; and the bases of, and threats to, an ideal society. By reading these three works of art in sequence, we will thus look at how authors engage similar issues in different ways, paying particular attention to the role of of history, nation, genre, politics, literary tradition, and authorial identity. Finally, we will consider the ways in which authors’ revising, refuting, and re-envisioning of “source” texts affects our readings of the “source” texts as much as the new.",Julie Crawford,9:00am,12:10pm,10272,Morningside,S3851-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3851-20222-001/,613 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222ENGL3851S001,LECTURE

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy.

ENGL UN3743,HARLEM CROSSROADS,"Focusing on the politics of literary and performative cultural production while exploring the fashioning of New Negro identity, Harlem Crossroads analyzes Harlem Renaissance-era fiction, poetry, essays, artwork, and music in a cross-cultural, transnational context. Beginning with an exploration of the aesthetic debates and cultural contexts that animated Harlem in 1920s to 1930s, the course will also take up the legacy of Harlem as a location important in creating a “racial” art in/for a diverse, global community comprised of differences in gender, class, sexuality, geographic and national origin.  In summer of 2022, the course will place relations between African American and New Negro cultural production in dialogue with Black European conceptions and experiences of race and belonging by exploring the work and lives of two AfroScandinavian artists in particular: African American and Danish writer Nella Larsen and AfroSwedish hip-hop artist, writer, and activist Jason Diakité. Author of the Harlem Renaissance novels Passing and Quicksand, Larsen dramatized the complexities of belonging in places with stark racial regimes that are inflected by gender, sexuality, and geography. Born in the 1970s to interracial American parents in Sweden (his father hails from Harlem) Diakité also grew up between worlds, riding a delicate cultural and racial divide. Diakité and Larsen share the task of unifying a complex system of family roots across continents, ethnicities, classes, colors, and eras; they both yearn for and problematize what it means to come home to Harlem. In June of 2022, Diakité will perform the stage version of his memoir, A Drop of Midnight at Harlem Stage— Diakité will visit the course to discuss his personal and artistic journey and we will also study and see a performance of A Drop of Midnight, in collaboration with Harlem Stage.",Monica L Miller,1:00pm,4:10pm,10302,Morningside,S3743-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3743-20222-001/,205 Barnard Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222ENGL3743S001,SEMINAR

In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century – country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.  Why does the novel appear?  What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society?  Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?  To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.  Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen. Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,

Studying the elements of the city’s well-known, and not so well-known crimes, can open a lens into the race, class, and gender structures at work in our metropolis, and reveal whom they benefit, and whom they harm. The current explosion in True Crime books, podcasts, blogs, and documentaries, and the fact that women are taking control of more of these narratives cannot be ignored. Students will choose an actual criminal case from New York’s recent or not so recent history (e.g. Typhoid Mary), and write a nonfiction story driven by their point of view, which will emerge from shorter pieces and research done during the class. The coursework will cover best writing practices, such as learning the skills of legally sound, ethical reporting, interviewing people on sensitive matters, and using public records—all in the interest of uncovering and shaping the raw material into a story that needs to be told, for victims who may not always have the tools to tell them. Readings will include Michelle McNamara’s I’ll Be Gone in The Dark, Becky Cooper’s We Keep the Dead Close, James Polchin’s Indecent Advances, and excerpts from Christopher Payne’s photography book, North Brother Island, the Last Unknown Place in New York City. We will take virtual tours of public archives, the Museum of the City of New York, Central Park, and The East River, listen to Laci Mosley’s Scam Goddess, and view documentaries and films such as Strong Island, The Witness (about Kitty Genovese), and Summer of Sam.

This workshop will be process-focused rather than outcome-focused. As your teacher, my concern is not perfection— I care about pulse. Everyone will be bringing in new, unfinished work that is a little raw and uncomfortable. No one knows what they’re doing, we’re all in the same boat! My goal for you is not to get stuck when you get lost (because if I do my job right you will get lost), but instead I hope to give you tools that help you find your way in the dark, take bold risks, and above all keep going. Every play is different and has its own rules. In order to fashion those rules autonomously we have to learn to listen deeply, follow an inarticulate hunch, and above all, be willing to fail. Be brave, playwright! This is where the wildness lives, where all the scary fun is to be had. And in the end… it’s just words on a page, ink on paper— you can always tear it up and start over.

Students acquire practical knowledge and tools focusing on the development, testing, and validation of new products that solve real customer problems and needs, from idea to early product development.  Students can expect to learn how to:  
  
identify and articulate customer problems in an accurate way, reflecting how individuals truly experience the problem and its challenges
  
create effective customer surveys to help validate your assumptions on customer problems (pain points), solutions, and benefits (expected outcomes)
  
assess current solutions provided in the marketplace in order to build on best practices as well as identify gap areas
  
develop a minimal viable product in order to gain additional feedback on specific solution features
  
measure and validate customer needs fulfillment or social impact assumptions

Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format. For each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.  Students work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class, they refine their venture’s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.

ENLW PS0101,Law at the Cutting Edge of Technology,"This class explores the application of legal principles to advancements in technology, including social media, drones, video games, cryptocurrency, and smartphone apps. In learning about these particular topics, students gain a more general understanding of some of the most important concepts underlying much of U.S. law.
 
 We analyze the law of nuisance and trespass through the lens of Pokemon Go, and we look at the legal concept of negligence by examining product liability issues arising from injuries related to autonomous vehicles and SnapChat filters. The class then explores how the right to privacy is impacted in the physical world by drone technology, and how privacy interests are impacted in the digital world by data gathering platforms such as Facebook. We look at legal issues having to do with the future of money, gaining a basic understanding of blockchain and its role in cryptocurrency and fractional asset ownership through tokenization. Finally, through a study of “influencer” marketing, we explore advertising, marketing, and contract law through a case study of the infamous Fyre Festival.
 
 Students learn through a combination of lecture, discussion, debate, and group work. Content and learning examples are presented in various forms, including PowerPoints, short videos, images, in-class demonstrations, and a guest speaker. Students complete a culminating project involving an oral small group presentation.
 
 Through this immersive learning experience, participants gain a broad understanding of the law as well as enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills. They learn how to approach complex, dynamic legal problems and methodically analyze all relevant factors so as to arrive at logical, evidence-based results. Further, they practice collaborative co-creation and public speaking as they work in small groups on their culminating oral presentations.",Mrinali Menon,3:10pm,5:00pm,10716,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Law at Cutting Edge of Te,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ENLW,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENLW/K0101-20222-001/,511 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222ENLW0101K001,LECTURE
ENVH PS0101,Environmental Justice: From the South Br,"Climate change and inequitable urban planning have damaging effects on people living in certain communities. Often these communities are people of color, indigenous, or living in poverty. From the city planner Robert Moses to the waste transfer stations disproportionately located in the Bronx, the rate of asthma for that area is one of the highest in the country. As our country plans to drill for oil and gas and create pipelines, who is impacted and what is the cost? What is the impact of deforestation? With global climate change, poorer countries are already facing life-threatening consequences. This course will examine the disproportionately damaging impacts of climate change and other environmental justice issues in the United States and abroad, and discuss viable proposals for resolving these issues.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,11005,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Environmental Justice: Fr,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ENVH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENVH/K0101-20222-001/,227 Seeley W.

ETHI PS0201,Introduction to Philosophical Enquiry: E,"Most broadly, ethics is concerned with how it is best for us, as human individuals and communities, to live – how we understand and relate to ourselves, each other, and beyond. What goals or values should we pursue? What kinds of lives are good and worthy of choice (for anyone)? What moral duties do we have – are there individual actions or social policies which are (morally) required or forbidden? And to whom or what do we owe them – in virtue of what do entities have moral standing? Is acting morally good for us and, if so, would this compromise the ethical worth of so acting? What is the source of our knowledge, if any, about these matters, and how do we resolve conflicting answers to these questions?   While attending some to ‘meta-ethics’, the course focuses on normative ethics and its application. After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics – consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly ‘Kantianism’ and ‘contractualism’), and some of the traditions of ‘virtue ethics’. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech.   Our authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois.   The course has three main goals for students: 
1
) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives – historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western – on ethics; 
2
) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct (logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; 
3
) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly.   There are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10717,Morningside,N0201-20222-001,Philosophy: Ethics,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ETHI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ETHI/N0201-20222-001/,717 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222ETHI0201N001,LECTURE
ETPH PS0100,The Ethics of Tech,"This course probes the evolving ethical, political, and social questions that have begun to emerge as a result of rapid technological transformations in the 21st Century.  Students are introduced to selections of classical moral and political philosophy, which provides a critical vocabulary for discussing a broad range of concerns that have animated the emerging field of tech and ethics. We discuss issues associated with AI, algorithmic bias, data and privacy, free speech and content regulation, and antitrust claims against tech giants, among other topics. Participants debate specific issues and write sample policy reports based on case studies.",Aygenc Berfu,3:10pm,5:00pm,10958,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ETPH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ETPH/K0100-20222-001/,313 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222ETPH0100K001,LECTURE

FASH PS0101,Fashion Design: Focus on New York City S,"In this course students explore fashion with a particular focus on style and culture in New York City and then develop their own designs.  Participants get a first-hand look at the field through discussion with active figures in the fashion industry such as designers, marketing directors, and stylists. They take virtual field trips to locations such as the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Readings on the history, theory, and culture of fashion include works by icons, artists, writers, editors, philosopher, and activists such as Diana Vreeland, Susan Sontag, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Rudofsky, and Marilyn Bender. As a springboard for inspiration and discussion, we view the works of a variety of designers through film clips and videos. Through our explorations into fashion as art we encounter individuals who live and enact fashion through performative dress, at times challenging social and gender expectations  Having gained a firm grounding in the field, participants research and formulate their own original fashion concepts. Based on these concepts, they design their own unique collections. Concepts may center on a particular motif (e.g., technology as an extension of the human body), period or style (e.g., British monarchy, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt, imagined future, underwater or deep space), or material inspiration (e.g., mylar, fiber optics, recyclables, etc.). While sharing sources of inspiration and research discoveries with attention to both craft and theory, in addition to producing our individual collections, we engage in a collaborative design project.",Eva Goodman,3:10pm,5:00pm,10987,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Fashion Design: NYC Style,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),FASH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FASH/K0101-20222-001/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222FASH0101K001,LECTURE

Instructor:
 Richard Pena  
​
Taught in English.
  
This course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. 
  In the early 1960s, a number of new film movements emerged in national cinemas around the world. Called “new waves” or “new cinemas,” these movements, made up of young filmmakers, would challenge the cinematic industrial structures in each of their respective nations, as well propose both radically different approaches to filmmaking and to cinematic storytelling. Perhaps inevitably, these films and filmmakers would also be drawn into larger political discussions about the futures of their respective nations. This course will explore three important examples of this development—the French New Wave, the Japanese New Wave and the Brazilian Cinema Novo—detailing both the commonalities among these movements (aesthetic, social, technological, political) as well those factors which made each unique. Among the filmmakers included will be Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Nagisa Oshima, and Glauber Rocha. The relationship of these respective “new waves” to simultaneous radical experiments in visual arts, theater, literature and music will be a special focus of the course. A watershed moment in film history that would forever change the way films were made, financed, seen and discussed.  To enroll in this course, you must apply to the

FILM PS0100,Understanding Cinema: Analyzing Film Lan,"This course introduces students to the art and analysis of cinema through examination of works by filmmakers ranging from Orson Welles to Martin Scorsese. Readings, screenings, the analysis of clips and full-length movies, as well as hands-on exercises such as storyboarding, blocking, shooting, and editing a scene all combine to convey the excitement and artistry of film.
 
 Week One:
 
 Students learn how motion pictures developed their own language—their own, universally understood visual system of representation—by studying the masters of early and contemporary cinema: the edge-of-your-seat last minute rescue scenes of D.W. Griffith; the bravura long takes of Jean Renoir; the nail-biting tension created by Quentin Tarantino; and the nerve-tingling suspense that is the hallmark of Alfred Hitchcock. Beginning with a storyboard, students will try their hand at conceptualizing a scene from start to finish in the style of classical Hollywood cinema.
 
 Week Two:
 
 Having learned Hollywood’s tricks of the trade, we branch out into international cinema, where other nations developed different systems of representation—their own languages—that challenged but also inspired the American film industry. Meet the Soviet style of filmmaking that revolutionized cinema in every sense of the word; the Gothic excess of German Expressionism, whose use of lighting, setting, and costume echoes in all contemporary horror flicks; and the bold surrealism of Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dali, and Maya Deren, whose cinematic experiments impact on dream sequences to the present day. Each student writes a review of one contemporary American film that owes a debt to foreign cinema—or vice versa.
 
 Week Three:
 
 Putting it all together, Week Three culminates in group analyses of some of the masterworks of classical and contemporary cinema such as Citizen Kane, Run, Lola, Run and La La Land. We examine and discuss the ways in which sound and image, editing, and the elements of mise-en-scène combine to create transporting cinematic experiences that have the ability to make audiences cry, experience fear, feel empathy and joy and, above all, marvel at the magic of movies.
 
 Daily readings include film reviews and essays on film analysis, technique and history. Students are also responsible for an oral presentation on a specific scene, film, or director of their choice.

In the first three days of this course an introduction to the major avenues of expression in the cinema—cinematography, editing, mise-en-scène, sound and narrative—will be provided.

We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe.

FINC PS0202,Introduction to Socially Responsible Inv,"There is no denying the significant growth in the focus on Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) Investing that has taken place over the past few years, with trends around climate change leading the charge. What was once deemed a public value focal point has blossomed into a prudent investment strategy as research has indicated that companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainable business practices, in the long-run, outperform those that do not. The result has been a mass migration towards ESG and Impact investing.  This course is an introduction to socially responsible investing and an overview of the differences between ESG and Impact Investing. We investigate the relationships between ESG investing, outperforming market returns, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  The materials presented in class as well as class discussions empower students to answer questions such as:  
  
How can investing be reconciled with sustainability and achieving the sustainable development goals?
  
Will ESG investing become the norm rather than the exception?
  
What are the links between green finance and ESG investing?

FOVA PS0101,Critical Focus on the Visual Arts: Art a,"A two-course curricular option that provides a concentrated study of aesthetic concepts for students interested in the visual arts. Both courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis, skills that will be valuable to students in whatever fields they choose to pursue in college and beyond. Numerous field trips to museums and architectural landmarks throughout the city enable students to take advantage of New York’s vast cultural resources.  
Architecture and Society: New York’s Built Environment
  This course introduces students to the visual analysis of architecture. Instead of surveying the history of architecture, we look at specific New York landmarks to understand how great structures not only fulfill practical needs but also influence our relationship to the physical and social world around us. By studying some of New York’s notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. As students learn to “read” these sites closely, they become familiar with the basic vocabulary of architecture (including light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same basic elements to different ends.  Some of the sites we explore together typically include Columbia University’s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9/11 Memorial.  
Problems in the History of Art
  This course covers selected monuments of painting and sculpture from various eras and cultures as well as basic trends and concepts in the history of art. Students learn about art from both the artist’s perspective (focusing on materials and technique) and the art historian’s perspective (focusing on issues of patronage, context, and interpretation), with both ultimately impacting how we view these objects in the modern world.  The goal of this class is to examine specific objects and encourage students to think about formal analysis—understanding the choices artists make, as well as how these objects reflect upon their specific culture and era. Rather than addressing the subject of art history in the traditional survey fashion, this course will be topic-based, with particular emphasis on how curatorial decisions impact the way we view works of art.  Field trips typically include visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,",Thomas I Campbell,1:10pm,4:00pm,10721,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Critical Focus on Visual,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),FOVA,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FOVA/K0101-20222-001/,401 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222FOVA0101K001,SEMINAR

  The goal of 
FREN3405OC
 is to help students improve their grammar and perfect their writing and reading skills, especially as a preparation for taking literature or civilization courses, or spending a semester in a francophone country. Through the study of two full-length works of literature and a number of short texts representative of different genres, periods, and styles, they will become more aware of stylistic nuances, and will be introduced to the vocabulary and methods of literary analysis. Working on the advanced grammar points covered in this course will further strengthen their mastery of French syntax. They will also be practicing writing through a variety of exercises, including pastiches and creative pieces, as well as typically French forms of academic writing such as “résumé,” “explication de texte,” and “dissertation"".

 Séverine C. Martin-Hartenstein  
Taught in French.
  The main thread guiding this course will be an interrogation on the place of French literature in today’s global landscape. Drawing on the complex history of France’s colonial past, as well as on the rich debates that shaped French intellectual history in the aftermath of World War Two, this course will offer a variety of readings reflective of French geographic and cultural diversity (e.g.: African and Caribbean literature, works focusing on identity politics, multiculturalism, and migration issues). Through encounters with leading figures of today’s French literary scene (e.g.: authors, publishers, literary agents, guest speakers) students will also learn about the global pressures (e.g.: economic, social, political and ideological) that are placed on French literature today, and the ways in which global demands inform the conditions in which literature is being read and produced. A further objective of this course is to demonstrate the diversity of current literary practices and reception modes. A listing of excursions and guest speakers will be provided at the beginning of the course.  To enroll in this course, you must apply to the

Whether they were explicitly banned or censured, deemed too grotesque, pornographic, or violent, or quite simply panned or labeled unwatchable, the films in this course come up against received expectations of what a film could or should . We will begin with Louis Malle’s 
Les amants 
(1958), which was famously banned in the US, and sparked an important legal debate about the nature of the pornography in the US (Judge Potter Stewart’s famous claim: “I know it when I see it”). We will move into lesser-known examples of French New Wave of the 1960s and ‘70s, notably a concert-film by Jean-Luc Godard, 
Sympathy for the Devil

3 points.  
Taught in French.
  
Prerequisite: 4-5 semesters of French language study or the equivalent. 
  French cinema is characterized by its artistic richness, its vigor and, above all, its diversity. This film history course will function as a journey in which we explore contemporary French cinema. Our itinerary will take us from the 1990s, those of “young French cinema” and neoclassicism, to the end of the 2010s, those of directors like Julie Delpy and Christophe Honoré. Together, we will develop a panorama in which the works of Cédric Klapisch and Nicole Garcia will intersect, as well as those of Céline Sciamma and Arnaud Desplechin.  The objective of this course will be to introduce students to French cinema, its history and its diversity. We will also have the chance to correlate academic knowledge and practical experience, so as to give the students a significant idea of French film activity. The application process is competitive and will take place onsite in February.  To enroll in this course through the 
Columbia Summer in Paris

The course enables students to understand, speak, read, and write in German about a range of subjects (such as: family activities, studies, work and home life, as well as travel, economics, and current events) and helps them develop an understanding of German speaking cultures. Classes are conducted in German and supplemented with written homework and audiovisual materials. Assignments and activities are diversified to integrate undergraduate and graduate students’ academic and personal interests. The program draws on the German heritage of New York City (museums, Goethe Institut, restaurants, etc.). Students are encouraged to attend German-language films and musical performances. Students have many opportunities for informal conversation. Upon successful completion of the course (with a minimum grade of B), students should achieve novice high to intermediate low proficiency (ACTFL scale). Final grades are based on frequent oral and written tests, writing assignments, a project on German culture in New York, and a final examination (written and oral). Students are advised that this course constitutes a full-time commitment. The workload of this course is very intense and students will be expected to spend 4-6 hours studying every day outside of class and additional time on weekends.

GOPO PS0101,Introduction to International Relations,"The course begins by introducing international relations theory and practice, evolves into the evolution of the international order and concludes by discussing great power competition and economic statecraft.  The first half of the course presents theoretical and practical frameworks for understanding international politics and the policy decisions that shape global outcomes. It considers major international trends, such as the rise and fall of great powers, cooperation and conflict between states, and the influence of non-state actors on security, economics, and politics. With an emphasis on contemporary world affairs, it also explores the institutions, interests, ideas, and personalities behind international events. Foundational knowledge will be conveyed by looking at key historical events and the evolution of theoretical concepts that frame our understanding of international relations and informs policy. Each class meeting will use illustrative historical/contemporary cases to link theory to real world policy formation and execution.  The second half of the course, which builds on the material covered in part I, examines challenges to the current global order in a world of growing political, economic and military competition. We will examine the rise of great power competition among the United States, China and Russia and use of economic statecraft as a principle tool to advance each country’s interest. This part of the course examines each of these actors from an economic viewpoint, proceeding from the premise that a national economic base provides the resources from which these nations provide for domestic living standards while at the same time resourcing their national security objectives. The course provides an overview of each nation in context to its regional and the world economy. The course will examine contemporary and projected trends for each nation and relate these to security and strategy.  This is designed as an economics course for those who are interested in international relations but who do not have a deep knowledge of macro-economics. The instructor will familiarize students with basic macroeconomic concepts and provide a framework for inquiry which the course will apply to each of the actors.

SNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece
, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).  The second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.  Throughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).  
Course Objectives
: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia. 
The 
Stavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative

HCM_ K5360,HCM in the Nonprofit Sector,"Research shows that employment growth in the nonprofit sector has outpaced that of for-profit organizations, increasing at a rate three times greater over a recent ten-year period. At the same time, nonprofit entities frequently face human capital management (HCM) challenges distinct from their for-profit counterparts. In this elective course, students will explore theoretical and practical approaches to nonprofit HCM intended to help them acquire competencies in developing solutions to shifting internal expectations and external demands. The course will cover topics ranging from recruitment and engagement, compensation and benefits, and volunteer management, to diversity and inclusion, rewards and recognition, separation and severance, and board governance.

Disruptions, while often obvious and yet sometimes more below the surface, appear to be accelerating and continuous. Recent events have fundamentally affected organizational operations, employer/employee expectations and relationships, perceptions of social justice  and the perceived role and value of organizations within society.  Human Capital Management professionals are charged with stewarding their organizations to adapt to these changes and to anticipate and prepare for others. Managing Human Capital in organizations will require new ways of thinking, experimenting, and developing methods to creatively facilitate an environment that will produce high performance from employees.

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10060,Morningside,S3116-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3116-20222-001/,302 Fayerweather,In-Person,,4,,TR,20222HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the 
Global Core
 requirement, which is reflected on the Columbia online registry.  The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits. Finally, the course is regularly 
cross-listed 
with both the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and the Institute for the Study of Human Rights as well as with American Studies.",Darius V Echeverria,12:30pm,3:40pm,10056,Morningside,S3596-20222-001,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3596-20222-001/,318 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222HIST3596S001,LECTURE

The course will explore the idea of revolutionary ethics as conceived by Western and non-Western political philosophers and militants. The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties. Students will be exposed to different discourses of political militancy and radical politics and to reflect on the ethical implications of the history of radical thought and action in comparative perspective.",Alheli Alvarado-Diaz,1:00pm,5:00pm,10057,Morningside,S4981-20222-001,REVOL/RAD POLITICS-MARX-M,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S4981-20222-001/,301M Fayerweather,In-Person,,4,,TR,20222HIST4981S001,SEMINAR
HIST UN2176,"REVOLUTION & EMPIRE: HAITI & FRANCE, 178","Few periods in history have stirred imaginations and been debated as much as the so-called “Age of Revolution” at the turn of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Long seen through a self-righteous North-Atlantic lens, this era of (democratic) revolutions has today been decentered both spatially and conceptually to encompass other revolutionary upheavals around the globe and their twin other: empire. This course takes stock of these developments to explore how revolution and empire developed in tandem in France and Haiti, with ramifications across the Caribbean, Europe and beyond from 1789 to 1820. Topics covered include: the end of an “old” regime and birth of several new ones; the largest and most successful slave revolt in history; revolutionary politics and social transformation; the terror; Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture, and charismatic leadership; the first “total war” and new forms of empire-building; the legacies, memory, and forgetting of these events. Throughout, the course considers revolutionary upheaval and imperialism as intertwined processes driven both by determinate logics and by unintended consequences.  This course is lecture-based although students are expected to engage in short document-based discussions in class. All classes and readings will be English, and no prior knowledge of the period is required.",Thomas Dodman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10296,Morningside,W2176-20222-001,REVOL & EMPIRE: HAITI & F,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/W2176-20222-001/,603 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222HIST2176W001,LECTURE
HIST UN2497,"Colonial America, Imperial America: 1776","Since independence, Americans have fiercely debated the United States’ place in the world. Was the U.S. a nascent empire or an anti-colonial state? Caught between Western Europe, its remaining colonies, and the young nations of Central and South America, the United States struck a tense balance between imperial and anti-imperial tendencies. This course examines the transformation of the United States from an insular conglomeration of states to an imperial power. Alongside political debates in Washington and diplomatic wrangling in North America, South America, and Europe this course centers western expansion as a defining feature of the United States’ internal and international identity, placing the U.S.’s violent dispossession of indigenous peoples and commitment to slavery in conversation with other formative events like the Mexican-American and Spanish-American Wars.",Joshua S Morrison,9:00am,12:10pm,10297,Morningside,S2497-20222-001,"Colonial America, Imperia",Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S2497-20222-001/,333 Uris Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222HIST2497S001,LECTURE

This seminar will introduce students to different structures of global governance for development, trade, labor, finance, the environment, migration, and intellectual property and investigate their relationship with human rights. Students will learn about public, private, and mixed forms of governance, analyze the ethical and strategic perspectives of the various stakeholders and relate them to existing human rights norms. The course will examine the work of multilateral organizations such as the United Nations and the International Financial Institutions, as well as international corporate and non-governmental initiatives.",Rainer Braun,5:30pm,8:40pm,10228,Morningside,S4185-20222-001,HUM RIGHTS/GLOBAL ECON JU,Summer Session (SUMM),HRTS,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4185-20222-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222HRTS4185S001,SEMINAR
HRTS S4215,NGOS&THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT,"The human rights movement is one of the most successful social justice movements of our time, establishing universal principles that govern how states should treat citizens and non-citizens. The movement strengthens, and is strengthened by, a complex web of institutions, laws, and norms that constitute a functioning global system that builds on itself progressively, animated by strong NGOs. The course will address the evolution of the international human rights movement and on the NGOs that drive the movement on the international, regional and domestic levels. Sessions will highlight the experiences of major human rights NGOs and will address topics including strategy development, institutional representation, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement, campaigning, fundraising and, perhaps most importantly, the fraught and complex debates about adaptation to changing global circumstances.",Louis Bickford,5:30pm,8:40pm,10227,Morningside,S4215-20222-001,NGOS&THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOV,Summer Session (SUMM),HRTS,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4215-20222-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222HRTS4215S001,SEMINAR

 The focus of Music Humanities is the masterpieces of Western art music in their historical and cultural contexts. The specific goals of the course are to awaken and encourage an appreciation of Western music, to help the student learn to respond intelligently to a variety of musical idioms, and to engage the student in the issues of various debates about the character and purposes of music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since ancient times. Students become actively involved in the process of critical listening both in the classroom and in the live performances that are as central to the course in Berlin and in Paris as in New York. Using a “great works” approach, the course will look at the changing genres and styles of music, examining composers’ choices and assumptions, as well as those of their patrons and audiences, as it moves chronologically from the Middle Ages to the present.

Its specific goals are to awaken and encourage in students an appreciation of music in the Western world, to help them learn to respond intelligently to a variety of musical idioms, and to engage them in the various debates about the character and purposes of music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since ancient times. The course attempts to involve students actively in the process of critical listening, both in the classroom and in concerts that the students attend and write about. The extraordinary richness of musical life in New York is thus an integral part of the course. Although not a history of Western music, the course is taught in a chronological format and includes masterpieces by Josquin des Prez, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, among others.

HUMN PS0101,Human Rights in the 21st Century: Challe,"Are human rights still relevant in promoting social justice and freedom in the 21st Century? Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II. However, recent rises in authoritarianism and anti-liberal regimes have raised new questions on whether the human rights framework is still capable of addressing injustices in the modern world. This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.
 
 In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.
 
 In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.
 
 Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities. The primary assignment for this course is participation in an international moot court activity, which challenges students to research and give oral arguments on a fictitious human rights case.

IDRA PS0201,DRAWING: EYE & IDEA,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  In this beginner-level class, students explore various modes of looking at and interpreting the world through drawing. The course emphasizes drawing from both observation and imagination as ways to learn traditional drawing techniques and foster creativity and personal interpretation. Course assignments stress observation while focusing on experiments with materials so as to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition, use of charcoal and pencil, graphic drawing techniques, wet media, color theory, and optical illusions.  The course combines studio work, including the study of the human figure using live nude models, with outdoor drawing, individual and group critiques, and visits to major museums and art galleries. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week in the form of a short seminar, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.  Participants also learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications, and the session concludes with a group show to which parents, friends, and other program participants are invited.",Ioana I Manolache,1:10pm,4:00pm,10741,Morningside,N0201-20222-002,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),IDRA,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IDRA/N0201-20222-002/,501 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222IDRA0201N002,LABORATORY
IENT PS0101,Introduction to Entrepreneurship & Innov,"This course is intended for students interested in learning the fundamentals of the innovation and development process that gives rise to ventures in both the commercial and social worlds. Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today’s venture success stories.  Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching “shark tank” style in front of a group of experts.  Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.

IEOR E4734,FOR EXCH/RELATD DERIVATVS INST,"Foreign exchange market and its related derivative instruments—the latter being forward contracts, futures, options, and exotic options. What is unusual about foreign exchange is that although it can rightfully claim to be the largest of all financial markets, it remains an area where very few have any meaningful experience. Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives—given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most of that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least comparatively speaking, a fact that makes the foreign exchange market an ideal platform for derivatives. The emphasis is on familiarizing the student with the nature of the foreign exchange market and those factors that make it special among financial markets, enabling the student to gain a deeper understanding of the related market for derivatives on foreign exchange.",David Derosa,6:00pm,8:30pm,11879,Morningside,E4734-20222-001,FOREIGN EXCH/RELTD DERIVATIVES,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IEOR/E4734-20222-001/,303 Seeley W.

IFLM PS0101,Filmmaking with iPhone & iPad,"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker’s Sundance feature film, 
Tangerine
, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary, 
Searching for Sugar Man
, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.  Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.  In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, sound – so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.  In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools/career paths.  On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.  Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",Yu Cheng,1:10pm,4:00pm,10742,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Filmmaking with iPhone &,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),IFLM,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IFLM/N0101-20222-001/,607 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222IFLM0101N001,LECTURE

The need for expertise goes far beyond having the best idea. It is knowing how to create an idea using a process that builds collaborative relationships and ensures successful adoption of your expertise.     Drawing on examples from a variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies and tactics for designing services and products for organizations or institutions. The entire course and assignments will focus on working with a client to assess the environment, create a prioritized business case, and conclude with an implementation plan. Topics will include whole systems development, strategies for engagement, diagnosis to discovery, ethics and managing your consulting relationship, change management, and establishing yourself as a trusted advisor.     This is a hands-on course where students are expected to identify an existing consulting assignment (internal or external) that we will work throughout the class to help their client improve its effectiveness and competitiveness.

IKNS PS5305,The Science of Communities and Networks,"For-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike, are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, foster pluralism, and innovate. For example, realtor COMPASS, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and electric cooperatives are all leveraging networks. The ideas of “open” and “collective” are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.     “Networked Work” presents the structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:     
  
social networks
  
communities of practice (or knowledge-networks),
  
open source,
  
open data, and
  
open innovation.

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy?

In this final project, students collaborate and work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools/career paths.  On the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants. The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",Yu Cheng,3:10pm,5:00pm,10746,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Intro to Digital Filmmaki,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),INDI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INDI/N0101-20222-001/,140 Uris Hall,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

INMK PS0140,Introduction to Marketing Communications,"What is marketing communications? Is it buying and selling, advertising and promotion, surveys and telemarketing, or looking at how consumers buy? Do you want the same stuff your friends have; do you want to be part of the “in” crowd; and what do your clothes say about you?  In this course students examine multiple ads and promotional programs, read about how companies try to reach consumers, and discuss consumers’ responses to companies’ programs. They explore how companies advertise and promote their products to the consumer.  The morning session is devoted to lecture and class discussion. In the afternoon, students are often divided into small teams to do hands-on and group work and present their findings to the class for Q&A. As a final project, they work in teams to create, brand, and develop a comprehensive written marketing and communications plan for a new product, which they also present to the class.",Wesley Stroud,3:10pm,5:00pm,10748,Morningside,N0140-20222-002,Intro Marketing Communica,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),INMK,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INMK/N0140-20222-002/,313 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222INMK0140N002,LECTURE
INMM PS0260,Thinking & Problem Solving: A New Look a,"In this curricular option, which is intended for students who enjoy math and logical reasoning, participants develop a deeper appreciation for the richness of mathematics while further developing their thinking and problem-solving skills. The combination of subjects and methods enables participants to experience math in a way high schools are often unable to present it, approaching problems as open-ended opportunities for creativity, independent thinking, and intellectual excitement.  The course is divided into three units:  
  
Logic: An exploration of logic builds the groundwork for further mathematical reasoning. What is mathematical logic? How does one structure a proof? How can this framework be applied to philosophical thought? One topic covered is game theory (how mathematicians study decision-making), which has applications in fields such as economics, biology, and psychology.
  
Counting and Probability: Abstract counting, in the form of combinatorics, serves as an introduction to set theory, which in turn sets the stage for probability theory. As an application, the class delves into cryptography, looking at how math can be used to create and read secret messages.
  
Advanced Topics: In the final week, building on what we have done already and depending one students’ interests, we look at a few advanced topics. Potential topics include planetary orbits, symmetry, topology, common statistical fallacies, and Markov chains.

KNOW PS0101,"Knowledge, Reality, and Truth","Is it possible that how things “really” or “truly” are is very different from how they appear to us? Could it be, for example, that the “real world” in which we believe ourselves to live is actually a computer program, á la 
The Matrix
? If not, then how can we know that this is not the case – what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge – what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference – would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways – if we actually are living in the Matrix?  In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato’s 
Republic
 and René Descartes’ 
Meditations
, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.  This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students’ abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.  Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10756,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,"Knowledge, Reality, and T",Pre-College Programs (SHSP),KNOW,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/KNOW/N0101-20222-001/,304 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222KNOW0101N001,LECTURE

LANI PS0213,Language & Identity: A Linguistic Explor,"In this course students examine language as a vital part of culture and social structure while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We first tackle assumptions and myths we hold about language. For example, can animals learn to use language? Do Eskimo languages really have 17 separate words for snow? Is English the hardest language to learn? Then we explore the components of language (phonemes, morphemes, words, and sentences) and how each plays a role in what we hear as an “accent” or dialect. Thus, students investigate both the structural and cultural functions of human language.  The course employs a multi-disciplinary approach to investigating language behavior and variation in different cultures. This occurs mainly through the term project, which provides each student with the opportunity to conduct fieldwork as a means to research a culture and its use of language. Participants come to better understand themselves as members of their own cultures and language as a shaper of our self-identities in human society.  In the morning sessions we examine material in a seminar format. Afternoons are devoted to research, analysis of case studies, and other hands-on applications including probing popular culture, literature, and film for evidence of language used as a way to define cultural and social identities.  Students develop the skills of data collection and cross-linguistic and cross-cultural analysis and come away with a perspective of multiple viewpoints related to language correctness and relativity.",Allison Shapp,3:10pm,5:00pm,10757,Morningside,N0213-20222-001,LANGUAGE AND IDENTITY,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LANI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LANI/N0213-20222-001/,302 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222LANI0213N001,LECTURE

Whether a lawyer or a layperson, there is opportunity for individuals to engage in advocacy, whether on behalf of a single battered woman or in support of displaced refugees. In this course, which focuses primarily on the legal system in the United States, we:  
  
Survey the fundamentals of substantive law, such as criminal law, constitutional law, property law, contract law, and torts.
  
Explore legal procedure as a means to enhance – or frustrate – justice.
  
Look closely at successful litigation and political movements as means of bringing about social change.
  
Meet legal practitioners in a variety of advocacy areas who share how they use the law to achieve the ends of justice.
  
Visit pertinent sites such as the New York County Criminal Court and District Attorney’s Office (inspiration for 
Law and Order
) and the United Nations Headquarters.
 
  Case studies come from areas such as civil rights, environmental protection, criminal justice, immigration policy, international human rights, family law, and animal rights.  Participants should be willing to dedicate several hours per week on case law readings, drafting of briefs, and related mock trial/moot court preparation.

LAW_ PS0101,Introduction to Criminal Law,"This course is designed to give students an opportunity to explore substantive criminal law and its attendant legal issues. Beginning with an introduction to the courts, legal system, and Constitution of the United States, the course provides students with a foundation for a detailed examination of the structure, policies, interpretation, and application of criminal law.  We delve into a variety of topics, from the basic elements of crimes such as homicide, robbery, and assault, to inchoate crimes like attempt and conspiracy, to crimes against property. Students evaluate the fairness and morality of punishments, including the death penalty, and analyze and apply legal defenses.

In the process, they gain insight into whether a career in law would be fulfilling to them.  At the heart of the course is exposure to the real world of legal practice. Through presentations by attorneys representing a broad range of practice areas and through visits to law firms, courts (including Manhattan’s Criminal Court, inspiration for television’s 
Law and Order
), and public interest legal organizations, participants learn first-hand about law as it is practiced in the corporate, government, and non-profit sectors.  The course teacher provides substantive instruction related to first-year law school courses as well as LSAT test prep information and gives students a clear view of the requirements for law school and attorney licensing in the United States.  Participants gain public speaking experience through debate, mock trial, and moot court exercises and engage in fundamental legal research and writing assignments, thereby developing skills which are transferable across academic disciplines.

LING PS0100,Exploring Topics in Linguistics,"This course offers an overview of the field of linguistics, the scientific study of human communication. It will cover the major components of language, including phonology (sound patterns), morphology (word formation), semantics (meaning), and syntax (sentence formation).  Students will examine the essential role communication plays in daily life, and the ways languages can vary by culture and evolve over time. They will explore topics such as dialects, slang, stereotypes associated with different accents, MRI research on language processing in the brain, differences between human and animal communication, taboo words, figurative statements, and the Internet’s impact on “proper” English. The course will also include talks by guest speakers, professionals in their fields who will share their valuable expertise.  Students will act as language scientists for the week, analyzing linguistic phenomena and working with texts, lectures, fieldwork, and videos that demonstrate how language permeates life.

LITR PS0101,Explorations in Modern Literature,"In this course we explore modern literature from early pioneers such as Dostoyevsky, Emily Dickinson, and Rimbaud through to the full-fledged modernism of Kafka, Woolf, and Hemingway, and beyond to writers including Ralph Ellison, Philip Roth, and Toni Morrison and movements such as the Confessional poets, the Beats, and magical realism. We focus mainly on shorter fiction and poetry, but may also look at excerpts from some longer works.  We consider not only the meanings of the works but also what it is about how they are written and constructed that gives them their power. While the focus is largely on close reading and formal analysis, we also look at historical context and pay attention to how literature sounds and makes us feel.  Modern literature has had close ties to trends in visual art, music, theater, and film and so we may consider works from these other art forms and how they reflect back on written texts. We will likely visit the Museum of Modern Art and perhaps another major museum.  Course participants are expected to contribute actively to class discussion, write a number of informal reaction pieces, engage in a few short creative projects, and prepare oral presentations on works of their own choosing. Students learn how to read actively, think analytically, present their ideas coherently (in both written and spoken form), and collaborate with their peers—all skills that will be invaluable to them in college and in their personal and professional lives.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:10pm,10256,Morningside,W1001-20222-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Dabashi,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/W1001-20222-001/,333 Uris Hall,In-Person,,4,,TR,20222MDES1001W001,LECTURE

Taught in English. 
  
This course is approved as a Global Core at Columbia. 
  This course examines the social, political and cultural history of migration in the Mediterranean,
 with a particular focus on France and Africa. We examine the forces that have underpinned
 migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions
 in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an
 object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a ‘total social fact’ involving political,
 social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres
 and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with
 questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between
 politics and the arts.  To enroll in this course through the 
Columbia Summer in Paris
 program, you must apply to the through the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).

MEPO PS0104,The Media and Politics in the United Sta,"This course explores a broad range of questions concerning the relationship between the media and politics, with a focus on historical and contemporary issues presented in the American context: Do the news media educate or manipulate the citizenry? What is the role of the press in a democracy and how does the First Amendment protect the press in the United States? What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing “weaponization” of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America’s system of democratic government.  Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10785,Morningside,N0104-20222-001,The Media and Politics in,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MEPO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MEPO/N0104-20222-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222MEPO0104N001,LECTURE
MGLO PS0101,The Media and Politics in Global Perspec,"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.  We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.  Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10786,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Media and Politics: Globa,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MGLO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MGLO/N0101-20222-001/,412 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222MGLO0101N001,LECTURE
MIGR PS0101,Global Migration & Personal Identity,"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one’s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.  This course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?  Participants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies—and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.  We approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.

MIGR PS0101,Global Migration & Personal Identity,"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one’s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.  This course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?  Participants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies—and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.  We approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.  Outside of class, students read articles on migration theory as well as various case studies, including life stories of young migrants in Europe, accounts of the border crisis in the US, and testimonies from DACA recipients.

MOCH PS0208,Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry,"Chemistry, the central science, is the science of molecules and bonds. Its signature is change in all its manifestations, from events that happen on a geological time scale to those that happen instantaneously, from the cosmological to the subatomic scale. Chemistry provides powerful scientific tools that extend our ability to sense the magnitudes of change by stretching the limits of what we know of our universe.  Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry is designed for highly motivated students who want to strengthen their understanding of chemistry and current research methods. The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a presentation by senior faculty members and researchers that is expanded upon through small group discussions and laboratory experiences.  Topics have been selected because they stand out as essential themes of current research, illustrate the methods of science, lend themselves to historical development, and highlight the role of chemistry as the central science. Through integrative experiments and collaborative projects, students discover the synthetic and analytic dimensions of chemistry in forensic, environmental, and materials problems. Experiments emphasize the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills.  Formal training includes instrumental methods in spectroscopy, chromatography, magnetic resonance, and computer simulations with state-of-the-art equipment in the department’s modern laboratories. Guest lecturers and field trips to area research facilities round out the program. Students are expected to complete a small research project, prepare a scientific paper, and participate regularly in class discussions.",Luis A Avila,3:10pm,5:00pm,10789,Morningside,N0208-20222-001,Modern Chemistry,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MOCH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MOCH/N0208-20222-001/,711 Havemeyer Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222MOCH0208N001,SEMINAR

NANO PS0226,Introduction to Material Science & Nanot,"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials—the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today’s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures—bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures—light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.  In this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.  Students investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia’s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",Luis A Avila,3:10pm,5:00pm,10790,Morningside,N0226-20222-001,Material Science & Nanote,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NANO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NANO/N0226-20222-001/,711 Havemeyer Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222NANO0226N001,LECTURE
NATU PS0101,"Natural Resources, Global Markets,  and","How has the US–China trade war affected the growth of world economies? Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?  This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.  Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers – i.e. export (supply/origin) and import (demand/destination) hubs – along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.  Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources – including those that are sustainable – and their effect in the global landscape.  Students gain an understanding of – and think critically about – various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",Wanda J Bell,1:10pm,3:00pm,10791,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Natrl Resource & Social I,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NATU,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NATU/N0101-20222-001/,633 Seeley W.

NECR PS5202,ADVANCED CONFLICT RESOLUTION,"This course explores the intersection of theory and practice in conflict resolution, giving students the opportunity to apply the models, frameworks, and theories they have studied in the NECR program to real-world scenarios. Students will analyze case studies, review current events, and bring to bear their own experiences in international, organizational, community, and interpersonal conflicts in an interactive setting as they continue to develop and hone their critical thinking skills.  Drawing from the disciplines of social psychology and clinical psychology, political science, international relations, and the latest advances in neuroscience, conflict resolution practitioners have at their disposal a wealth of research that can inform their analysis of how to assist parties to mitigate, de-escalate, and prevent conflict.    Building especially on the material covered in Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (PS5101), the participants in this class will engage with the course readings, instructors, and each other to critically analyze and deconstruct complex conflicts in a variety of contexts. A focus on the actors, issues, structures, strategies, and processes inherent in a conflict will be used in the effort to identify opportunities to change conflict dynamics. Multiculturalism, negotiation and mediation frameworks, accounting for bias, interdependency, intergroup conflict, social identity, peacebuilding, and power dynamics are among the key learnings integrated into the course.  The competencies advanced in this class are intended to be applicable beyond the program into other areas of life.

NOPM PS5170,PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS,"No one organization or sector has the full suite of capabilities, relationships or assets to tackle persistent and escalating social problems such as poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, equitable access to education and health care, among others. As public resources dedicated to societal benefit become scarcer and calls for accountability become more urgent, the public sector increasingly is turning to public-private partnership (P3) models. Consequently, these models and approaches are becoming as multi-faceted, systemic and global as the challenges they aim to address, with increased opportunities for philanthropy and the non-profit sector.     The term “public-private partnership” is often misused to identify mostly a shifting of risk from government to a private partner in exchange for an up-front payment. A true or “authentic” P3s generates collective benefits that exceed what individual partners could achieve on their own. This course will examine, through readings and case histories, P3 partnerships that involve the sharing of risks and rewards between public, private and nonprofit partners, where the sector-specific expertise and assets of multiple stakeholders are tapped and valued for innovation in the design, delivery and management of cross-sector projects and services. The emphasis will be on the role of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector as equal partners in all aspects of these shared-value partnerships. Students will consider questions about entrepreneurship, nonprofit leadership, and service: How should core public services be financed? What is the most effective way to manage day-to-day operations of public services? What does it mean to be accountable to the public? Examples are drawn from public health, education, international development, urban renewal, and others.      This is an elective that builds on the Nonprofit Management Program’s core curriculum and is designed for all Nonprofit Management Program students and, space permitting, is open to cross-registrants from other fields and/or Columbia University programs (other SPS programs; Teachers College; Business School; Mailman School of Public Health; SIPA). Students should have a strong understanding of the nonprofit development sector in the US; familiarity with international fundraising practices also is welcome.",Richard T Feiner,4:10pm,8:30pm,10550,Morningside,K5170-20222-H01,PUB/PRIV PARTNERSHIPS,Non Profit Management,NOPM,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NOPM/K5170-20222-H01/,318 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,W,20222NOPM5170KH01,LECTURE

NOPM PS5240,MAJOR & LEADERSHIP GIFTS & CAMPAIGN FUND,"This course provides a rigorous analysis for the design and management of a major, leadership and campaign fundraising program in the majority of nonprofit organizations. This class will examine the strategic skills to incorporate these initiatives into a balanced philanthropic program. From donor acquisition in an Annual Giving Campaign to The Ask for a Leadership Gift in a Capital Campaign, there will be an emphasis on understanding the donor and developing relationships. Students will learn how to identify major gift prospects from a strong annual giving program, build a major gift program, organize fundraising campaigns, establish a timeline, introduce explicit leadership expectations, and develop strategies to maximize the collective resources of volunteer leaders, donors and colleagues. Students will also explore how to position special gift opportunities within the context of a long-range strategic planning process.  Fundamental to a well-rounded fundraising curriculum, this course examines integrating, positioning and administering a major, leadership and campaign fundraising program within the context of a strong and robust development operation. The course explores such necessary and interrelated elements as: the identification of new prospects at every gift level, an understanding of what to look for in prospect research examination, various ways to cultivate donors of all levels to find those who can make the highest level gifts, a range of solicitation strategies with an emphasis on face-to-face asks, retention and stewardship of donors; the utilization of mission-driven or individual-driven major gift cases for support; the diverse psychological and emotional motivations of contributors; the development of meaningful working relationships with volunteer leaders; campaign strategy and preparation; and targeted solicitation strategies for responding to the unique personalities, interests, and needs of high capacity donors.  Critical thinking will be encouraged and ethical concepts central to the performance of philanthropic practices will be explored throughout the semester. Finally, the course examines qualities and skillsets of successful major gift officers and campaign fundraising, helping students become familiar and comfortable with the process of working with all development staff to build a strong major gift program, facilitating and managing the leadership ask, and participating in a comprehensive fundraising campaign.",Leah E Heister,6:10pm,8:00pm,10552,Morningside,K5240-20222-H01,MAJOR & LEADERSHIP GIVING,Non Profit Management,NOPM,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NOPM/K5240-20222-H01/,707 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,T,20222NOPM5240KH01,LECTURE

NSCI PS0100,Neuroscience and the Law,"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.  The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.  Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?  Some of the topics that may be addressed include the 
Frye and Daubert
 standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.  The course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",Florina Altshiler,3:10pm,5:00pm,10804,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NSCI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NSCI/K0100-20222-001/,517 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222NSCI0100K001,LECTURE

NYCS PS0215,New York Experienced: An Urban Case Stud,"An experiential, immersive course designed for students interested in the urban environment, culture, literature, history, and public policy. The course comprises four interconnected modules (see below). Two days each week are reserved for fieldwork in New York City with city policymakers, philanthropists, and artists.
 
 
New York City: A History of People, Politics, and Place
 What is New York City’s relationship to the American Dream? How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the other aspects in the course. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.
 
 
Writing the City
 How is our experience of New York – the city’s projected image and self-image – shaped by literature about the city? Using short stories, poems, popular song, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon. Beyond this examination, writing in the field enables students to reflect upon their experiences in the city and acts to tie the various threads of the course together while remaining true to the singular experience of each course participant.
 
 
Urban Place Design
 What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city? We study various answers to this question – public/private partnerships (e.g. Bryant Park), the NYC Department of Transportation Plaza Program, public parks (e.g. Central Park), privately-owned public spaces, and business improvement districts – in order to learn the fundamental dynamics of public space in New York City. Armed with that knowledge, we select a location and design our own proposals for public spaces. We also examine how previous urban designers, such as Robert Moses, sought to overcome the challenges faced in constructing (and reconstructing) the city – and how those solutions often have ramifications for today’s NYC. Fieldwork: visiting and evaluating public plazas, meeting with designers and policymakers at the NY Department of Transportation, Neighborhood Plaza Partnership, and Times Square Alliance.

PENQ PS0201,"Intro to Philosophical Enquiry: Love, Hu","This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.  We begin by reading and discussing Plato's 
Symposium
 and Aristotle's 
Nicomachean Ethics
, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom—a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia?    Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of existential freedom found in 
Being and Nothingness
 and Soren Kierkegaard’s religious freedom from 
Fear and Trembling
, which Donald Palmer introduces in 
Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy
. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work 
The Myth of Sisyphus
. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.  In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",Alec U Milton,3:10pm,5:00pm,10816,Morningside,N0201-20222-001,Intro to Philosophical En,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PENQ,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PENQ/N0201-20222-001/,702 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222PENQ0201N001,LECTURE

PHIL PS0101,"Radical Skepticism, Reliability & Eviden","This course introduces students to fundamental issues in the theory of knowledge. In this course we will critically address questions such as: (a) ""What are the unique kinds of knowledge and what is the relationship between these kinds of knowledge?” (b)""Does knowledge require justification and if so, what does such justification consist in?” and (c) “What propositions can we know in light of powerful skeptical arguments?” We will investigate such questions by looking closely at how a number of epistemologists from a wide range of traditions have answered them. As we progress through issues directly related to epistemology, we will also see that these issues connect up with important issues in other areas of philosophy as well (e.g., metaphysics and moral philosophy).  We engage with such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own positions concerning these issues. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  
  
To acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.
  
To develop an understanding of how issues concerning epistemology are of relevance to not only other areas of philosophy, but disciplines besides philosophy as well.
  
To accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers’ works on fundamental issues in epistemology, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.
  
To critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.",Jared Peterson,1:00pm,3:00pm,10817,Morningside,K0101-20222-D01,Introduction to Epistemol,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHIL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHIL/K0101-20222-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222PHIL0101KD01,LECTURE

Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds.

PHMN PS0100,"Minds, Brains, and the Nature of Conscio","How is the mind related to the brain? Are sensations, beliefs, and desires immaterial or physical states? What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?
 
 We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.
 
 Course readings include such influential works as René Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's ""Sensations and Brain Processes,” Hilary Putnam’s “The Nature of Mental States,” and Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.
 
 The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students’ analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",Jared Peterson,1:10pm,3:00pm,10819,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,Intro to Philosophy of Mi,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHMN,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHMN/K0100-20222-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222PHMN0100K001,LECTURE
PHOT PS0202,The Art of Cell Phone Photography,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  This class is an introduction to the tools and techniques of digital photography and the language of photo criticism. Using their own cell phone cameras students work to understand the functions and potentials of the cameras we carry with us every day while exploring the medium's context within contemporary photography.  Each day students undertake assignments designed to explore the distinct qualities of taking photos with a cell phone while engaging with the language and context of the photographic medium. We focus on storytelling, with assignments considering traditional formats of portraiture, still life, and landscape, as well as editing and sequencing. The class culminates in a project combining moving and still images.  We also look at digital platforms for sharing and publishing work and undertake projects which both finesse the cellphone camera’s abilities and embrace its glitches and limitations. This intensive program enables photographers to take full advantage of a tool already at their side and to fine-tune it into an art practice.",Rachel L Stern,1:10pm,4:00pm,10820,Morningside,K0202-20222-001,Art of Cell Phone Photogr,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHOT,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHOT/K0202-20222-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

PHPO PS0101,Understanding Modern Ideologies,"At the end of the Cold War, many in the West celebrated what they perceived as not only a political victory over the Soviet Union but also the intellectual and ideological ascendency of liberal democracy. And yet three decades later many liberal democracies are facing numerous challenges, if not outright crises.  This course explores the key political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world that seek to challenge, improve, and even threaten liberal democracy. We begin by asking what an ideology is, before delving into the various -isms including liberalism itself, capitalism, socialism, communism, populism, and nationalism. We investigate how these ideologies shape societies and mold social behavior, exploring their origins and principles. We ask how these ideologies intersect with democratic governance and offer different understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship. Our goal is not to determine which ideology is best but rather to understand and critique the many different ways of thinking about politics and society. We draft initial ideology statements, to be revised during the course as students reflect on and question their own assumptions and beliefs through engagement with different perspectives. Participants also engage in debates with their peers in order to practice articulating arguments in a persuasive manner.  Morning sessions are normally dedicated to reviewing and clarifying the assigned material, which includes classic and contemporary works in political theory as well as news and magazine articles and film clips. In the afternoon, students apply their understanding in group activities including debates, and engage with guest speakers from various ideological positions.  By the end of the course, participants not only better understand the key ideologies of the modern world but are also equipped with the analytical tools to critique and revise them in a forward-thinking way.",Ki Young Kim,3:10pm,5:00pm,10821,Morningside,K0101-20222-001,Understanding Modern Ideo,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHPO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHPO/K0101-20222-001/,601B Sherman Fairchild Life Sciences Building,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

It addresses questions such as: Why do some countries promote globalization while others resist it? What do IOs do in international politics? Who runs our system of global governance? We will explore these questions and others by focusing on topics such as international trade, foreign aid, investment, and the environment. For each topic, we will use a variety of theoretical lenses and then investigate the evidence in favor of each. More generally, the course will consider the challenges of drawing casual inferences in the field of international political economy. There are no prerequisites for this course but an introductory economy course would be helpful. Students will write a short reading response each week and produce a research proposal for studying a topic related to international political economy, though they do not need to actually conduct this research.",Davit Sahakyan,1:00pm,4:00pm,10305,Morningside,S3628-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/S3628-20222-001/,503 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,4,,TR,20222POLS3628S001,LECTURE

PPEC PS0100,Political and Economic Ideologies of the,"This course explores the central political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world, including capitalism, socialism, communism, liberalism, populism, and nationalism. We ask what principles define these ideologies, how these ideologies intersect with democracy, and how they produce and require different meanings and understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship.  Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.  By the end of the three weeks, students are equipped with not only a deeper understanding of the competing political and economic ideologies that shape the modern world, but also with the tools to make, understand, and critically evaluate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their future studies and as future citizens and leaders.",Geoffrey C Upton,1:10pm,3:00pm,10828,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,Political & Economic Ideo,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PPEC,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PPEC/K0100-20222-001/,327 Seeley W.

Instructor: Alfredo Spagna, Department of Psychology
  Modern theories attempt to characterize the human mind in terms of information processing. But machines that process information do not seem to 
feel 
anything; a computer may for instance receive inputs from a video camera, yet it would be hard to imagine that it 
sees 
or experiences the vividness of colors like we do. This course explores behaviors by understanding the influences of biological processes. What does a prototypical neuron look like? How do neurons talk to each other? How does neuronal communication produce behavior? Then we will move into asking deeper questions like: what happens in the brain when you want to move? why do we dream? How do we form memories? Nobody has yet provided a convincing theory as to how to explain the subjective nature of our mental lives in objective physical terms. Over four weeks, 
CSP23
 attempts to provide a strong introductory foundation to the field of human neuroscience.  Each week we will review a neuroscientific field, by following the four main components of the scientific method:  
  
Observation and formulation of scientific questions
  
Data collection and analysis
  
Accurate and transparent communication of results
  
High-level discussion of the findings and future directions and societal relevance

RELI S2305,ISLAM,"This course is designed as an introduction to the Islamic religion, both in its pre-modern and modern manifestations. The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ).

RLPH PS0101,"Divine Beings, Miracles, and the Afterli","This course introduces students to fundamental issues in philosophy of religion. We critically address questions such as the following: (a) Given the diverse range of religions in the world, what is it that makes them all religions? (b) Is it possible for miracles to occur? (c) What is the relationship between science and religion? (d) Is it reasonable to believe in an afterlife for beings like us?  We broach such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own views. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  
  
To acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.
  
To develop an understanding of the different branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy.
  
To accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers’ works on fundamental issues in philosophy of religion, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.
  
To critically assess, in a careful, charitable, and sophisticated manner, a number of challenging positions and arguments in philosophy of religion, and in doing so develop and refine our critical reasoning skills.",Jared Peterson,8:00am,11:00am,10844,Morningside,K0101-20222-D01,Philosophy of Religion,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),RLPH,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RLPH/K0101-20222-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222RLPH0101KD01,LECTURE
ROBO PS0101,Introduction to Robotics,"Participants in this course develop a foundation in robotics covering design, construction, and computer programing. They build robots using VEX robotics parts and programmed in ROBOTC, a C based language. Lectures on topics drawn from physics, engineering, and computer science are combined with hands-on group projects.  Lecture topics include kinematics, torque, motors, gear ratios, sensors, and control loop feedback mechanisms. In the hands-on projects, students observe, for example, that their robots are not able to drive in a straight line without sensors. This leads to an exploration of gyroscopes and encoders so as to correct the problem and eventually to a lecture on PID control and a gentle introduction to the concept, from calculus, of integration.  In the final week of the course, the students form into teams and build robots that compete against each other to perform a task taken from a prior robotics competition.",,3:10pm,5:00pm,10964,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ROBO,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ROBO/N0101-20222-001/,141 Uris Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222ROBO0101N001,LECTURE

SCIP BC0127,The Exploration of Space,"For millennia, humans have gazed in wonder at the stars.  Every culture developed its own mythology to make sense of the patterns in the night sky.  Then, in the last century, something amazing happened.  Our technology caught up to our wonder and we learned how to “slip the surly bonds of Earth.”  For the past six decades, some of our most cleverly designed machines and daring explorers have helped us dip our toes into the vast cosmic ocean that surrounds our little blue marble of a home.  In this course, we will study the people, science, and technology that have brought humanity some of its most captivating and unifying moments, from Isaac Newton to Neil Armstrong, from 
Sputnik
 to the James Webb Telescope.  At the same time, we will examine the social and political reasons why nations devote talent and resources to sending those machines and people into space in the first place.  We will also study the technical and human causes of noted disasters, such as 
Challenger
 and 
Columbia.  
Finally, we will consider whether, if we are careful enough, humanity may one day evolve into a truly spacefaring civilization.",Faculty,2:00pm,4:30pm,00036,Barnard College,S0127-20222-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),SCIP,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SCIP/S0127-20222-001/,302 Barnard Hall,,,0,,TR,20222SCIP0127S001,SEMINAR

Less well understood are the dynamics that arise from the interactions among different land ownership categories: federal, state, and private. Working landscapes are essential pieces of the cultural heartbeat of the region. This course will focus on: 1) the history of western settlement, highlighting the ways in which early Westerners divided up the land base and allocated resources; 2) the agencies in charge of managing federal public land including the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Park Service; and 3) state and private land, with a particular interest in the State Land Board. We will explore the legal and regulatory framework that guides land-use decisions, and study enduring resource access conflicts. Pulling from both academic scholarship and the gray literature in political science, environmental sciences, law, and organizational behavior, this course provides an interdisciplinary overview of governance challenges in the American West.  
Academic Schedule
  The course will start on Tuesday, May 31st and meet on Tuesdays/Wednesdays/Thursdays on Zoom (likely from 2-5 pm EST each day). The week of June 12th-19th the course will take place in the field in Colorado. The final week will be on Zoom on Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, again likely from 2-5 pm EST each day.

SNET PS0100,The Networked Self: Identity in the Digi,"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.  Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the “commodified self” and “self-branding.” 2) “Digital surveillance” and the “managed self.” 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically “marginalized” identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10845,Morningside,K0100-20222-001,The Networked Self,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SNET,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SNET/K0100-20222-001/,327 Seeley W.

SOCI PS0101,"Global Cities, Food, and Transnational C","As cities rapidly change, food and culture become centers of connection, influence, and transformation. This interdisciplinary course is an introduction to food and urban cultural studies. It serves as an opportunity to analyze discourses around food, transnational cultures, and urban space, and to apply critical thinking skills to understand the connection between these themes within broader questions. In this course, we will examine the transformation of global cities, culture, food, and capital, and how these are portrayed in different artistic and media productions.  We will employ a multidisciplinary approach to understand and analyze the commodification of food and cultures in connection with urban regeneration to enhance the symbolic economy of different cities. We explore how globalization has had an impact on the urban fabric. We will also emphasize inequality and how neoliberal practices have affected food accessibility and have contributed to gentrification. Additionally, students will examine cities virtually by exploring and comparing their neighborhoods, food stores and markets, gourmet restaurants, galleries and museums, other significant landmarks and cultural venues. The course will also touch on our own relationship to food, what factors do we take into consideration when we consume food? Does food play a key role when we define our identity? Is our heritage and culture relevant when we make food choices? How has our life changed when it comes to food and the way we experience the city after COVID-19? Are residents and our neighbors aware of these rapid changes?  Students explore different cultural and artistic productions to understand how the aforementioned processes are portrayed in visual culture. Topics that will be discussed include commodification of cultures, transnationalism, touristification, gentrification, neoliberalism, media, food and urban cultural studies, and consumer culture in different parts of the world.",Laura Vazquez Blazquez,5:00pm,8:00pm,10846,Morningside,K0101-20222-D01,"Global Cities, Food, & Cu",Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SOCI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/K0101-20222-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20222SOCI0101KD01,LECTURE

SOCW T7601,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment that was originally developed for chronically suicidal individuals and is now the gold standard treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder.  The treatment and its adaptations have since been proven through research to be effective across a wide range of disorders and behavioral problems which have at their core the issue of Pervasive Emotion Dysregulation.   Students will be introduced to key theoretical concepts that inform the “spirit” of DBT, along with an overview of core treatment strategies as used within a DBT skills group. This course is focused on DBT skills, and will provide students with a basic understanding of the four DBT skills modules (Core Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance). The focus will be on the revised and expanded DBT Skills Manual released in late 2014.  Through course assignments and in-class activities, students will have an opportunity to learn the content of the skills, as well as how to structure and conduct a DBT skills group.   Students will develop a beginning understanding of standard comprehensive DBT, the particular function of each treatment component, (e.g., individual, group, consultation team, coaching) and how DBT skills relate to the other program components. The basic format of this course will include the Instructor's presentation of concepts and principles, group discussion, modeling, role-plays, and technique coaching.  As a practice elective, the major focus is on skill development.  As such, students are expected participate fully in in-class practice exercises and be receptive to feedback from their classmates.",Kitama S Cahill-Jackson,6:15pm,8:45pm,11567,Morningside,T7601-20222-001,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILL,Social Work,SOCW,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCW/T7601-20222-001/,406 School of Social Work,In-Person,Social Work,3,,T,20222SOCW7601T001,SEMINAR
SOCW T7602,DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY PRACTICE,"This class is the first required course in the Columbia University DBT Training Program and only open to students admitted to that program. It is designed to prepare students for intensive DBT training and for their DBT internships in the community and for ensuring that program interns are prepared for beginning DBT practice with client populations exhibiting a range of behavioral dysfunctions.

Students will learn to translate this knowledge and understanding of human behavior to real world applications in clinical settings. Heavy emphasis will be placed on learning behavioral assessment techniques and developing treatment strategies based on behavioral conceptualizations. Specific techniques for putting this knowledge into practice will include instruction in functional analysis, behavioral assessment, behavioral change strategies, case conceptualization and treatment planning. Students will also gain knowledge of recent “third wave” behavioral treatments. Evidence and outcomes for behavioral treatments will be reviewed.

SOSC P8910,INTRODUCTION TO RACE AND HEALTH,"It is widely acknowledged that as a variable, 'race' often explains a significant portion of the variation we observe in patterns of morbidity and mortality. But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct ‘race’ to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",,,,12144,Morningside,P8910-20222-D01,INTRODUCTION TO RACE & HE,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOSC/P8910-20222-D01/,,In-Person,Public Health,1,,,20222SOSC8910PD01,LECTURE
SPAN BC3305,Sustainable Communities in Ecuador: What,"Indigenous people in Ecuador, which represent about 7% of the Ecuadorian population (United Nations, 2015), are disproportionately poor compared with the rest of the population. In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution. Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis.   The proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.  It aims to:  1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.  2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.  3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.  4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.  5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",Maria E Lozano,9:00am,10:15am,00022,Barnard College,X3305-20222-001,SUSTAINABLE COMMUN.

An intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. Prerequisite: SPAN UN 2101 or equivalent (as designated by the Department’s Placement Examination). In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. *This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences –including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

SREL PS0101,Explorations in Physics: Special Relativ,"This course offers an intensive exploration of one of the fundamental principle of physics –relativity. Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.  Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein’s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe.  In the process of exploring these challenging topics, course participants expand their capacity for creative problem solving and their ability to think critically and independently.",Anton Kananovich,1:10pm,3:00pm,10847,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Physics: Special Relativi,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SREL,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SREL/N0101-20222-001/,313 Pupin Laboratories,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20222SREL0101N001,LECTURE

While learning how to use the software, students are also introduced to several broad concepts in science and technology, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, signal processing, electrical circuit models, biological models, and mechanical models. Participants learn to apply these concepts by writing code and building models in MATLAB.  In the process of building those models, students learn how to legitimately carry on scientific inquiry. They apply this learning to create their own experimental paradigms in MATLAB. They formulate scientific questions and design hypotheses to test those questions. To test the hypotheses, they create experiments and collect the necessary data by building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with MATLAB. They further analyze data from the experiments using the MATLAB software and form conclusions regarding their scientific inquiry.

Nothing – whether a living creature or a settlement – can have a metabolic rate of zero.

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.  Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked “experts only.”  The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.  Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",Lucius J Riccio,6:10pm,8:00pm,10618,Morningside,K5033-20222-D01,DECISION MODELS & MANAGEM,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K5033-20222-D01/,304 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222SUMA5033KD01,LECTURE
SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.  Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.  This course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",Jonathan C Dickinson,6:10pm,8:00pm,10619,Morningside,K5035-20222-D01,GHG EMISSIONS CARBON FOOT,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K5035-20222-D01/,407 Mathematics Building,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222SUMA5035KD01,LECTURE

The purpose of this course is to establish a core energy skill set for energy students and prepare them for more advanced energy courses by providing a basic language and toolset for understanding energy issues.  Using theoretical and practical understanding of the process by which energy technologies are developed, financed, and deployed, this course seeks to highlight the root drivers for change in the energy industry, the technologies that are emerging, and the factors that will determine success in their commercialization. Understanding these market dynamics also informs good policy design and implementation to meet a broad range of social welfare goals.

As you leave the school and become leaders of organizations financial literacy will be a skill set that will be vital to success no matter what career path you go down. It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.  To understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm.

SUMA PS5770,SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT,"The course intends to give an overview of forests – how they function, and how they can be managed sustainably. The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.  The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.  For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival.

TCOL PS0101,"Creating Original Theater: Playwriting,","Designed for students with experience in drama who are interested in developing original theatrical productions, the course emphasizes the working relationship between actor, director, and playwright, and the unique dynamic that exists between them when working on untried material.  Workshops and lectures during the first week introduce students to the demands of play development. Students then elect to specialize in one of three areas: acting, directing, or playwriting. The remainder of the course is given over to the development of short plays to be written, directed, and acted by the students under the supervision of theatrical professionals. In small, autonomous groups of actors, each with its own director and playwright, students create a production to be mounted at the end of the program.  Workshops are interactive, with the evolving pieces of each play periodically shown to the entire group for feedback in a safe, supportive environment. The course affords students a unique opportunity to experience the nuances of professional theatrical collaboration.  In the last two days of each session, several of the completed plays are performed for an audience of peers, friends, and family members.

TELE PS0101,"Creating Television: Pitching, Writing,","Students learn how to develop their own TV shows in this hands-on course. The focus is on writing for television, which is at the heart of the creative process, but we also look at the history of the medium, how to pitch a show, and production. Ultimately participants film mini-pilots or key scenes from the shows they have developed.
 
 We begin with a brief history of television in the United States – its creation and how it has grown over the past seven decades. Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or “reality”) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.
 
 While learning about the “TV greats,” students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers’ medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.
 
 The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",Mark A Christopher,3:10pm,5:00pm,10855,Morningside,N0101-20222-001,Creating Television,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),TELE,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/TELE/N0101-20222-001/,311 Fayerweather,In-Person,"Pre-College Programs

Following an introduction to the United States legal system, students acquire a solid understanding of the trial process, including jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses and experts, introduction of exhibits, closing arguments, and theory building. Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.  Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.  The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.  Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently.

Root causes and effectiveness:
 What are the root causes of terrorism? When, if ever, is terrorism an effective strategy?
   
  
War and crime:
 Is counterterrorism generally best approached on the model of law enforcement? When, if ever, is counterterrorism best approached on the model of war? What are the pros and cons of each approach? This unit will focus on the debate about targeted killings in the United States and Israel.
   
  
Torture:
 Is the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” ever justified? Do the exigencies of counterterrorism require that certain techniques be brought within the bounds of the law? This unit will focus on debates in the United States and more recently in Israel.
   
  
Surveillance:
 How should counterterrorism policy strike a balance between security and privacy? This unit will focus on recent debates about surveillance programs in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.  In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.  In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.  Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film.

Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own.

WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",Emily K Austin,1:00pm,4:10pm,10193,Morningside,S4323-20222-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20222-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,TR,20222WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,5:30pm,8:40pm,10194,Morningside,S4810-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4810-20222-001/,413 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,ART WRITING FOR WRITERS,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required.   In this course, we will look at some of the most dynamic examples of ""visual writing."" To begin, we will look at writers writing about art, from the Romantic period through the present. The modes of this art writing we will consider include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which address or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, John Ashbery, and Eileen Myles, who for periods of their lives worked as art critics; writers such as Etel Adnan and Alexander Kulge, who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure; as well as numerous collaborations between writers and visual artists. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers, like artists Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, David Wojnarowicz, Moyra Davey, Paul Chan, and Hannah Black, as well as professional critics whose work has been elevated to the status of literature, such as Hilton Als, Janet Malcolm, and Susan Sontag. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of sonic and visual artists, such as those associated with Dada, the Harlem Renaissance, the New York School, and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course, students will also be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. They will produce original works in various of the modes described above and complete a final writing project that incorporates what they have learned.",Thomas A Donovan,5:30pm,8:40pm,10192,Morningside,W3215-20222-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3215-20222-001/,411 Dodge Hall,In-Person,,3,,MW,20222WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR

WRTI PS0100,Creative Writing: Introductory Workshop,"A course designed for students who have not had extensive experience in creative writing. Through frequent writing exercises, participants develop such writing resources as voice, imagery, characterization, dialogue, and narration. Experimentation is encouraged.  Daily workshops and seminars expose students to many aspects of the writing process, including generating ideas, writing and revising drafts, and editing. Participants practice their literary craft with an attentive group of their peers, under the guidance of an experienced instructor. They write extensively, read and respond to excerpts from outstanding works of literature, and participate in candid, helpful critiques of their own work and that of their peers. Students are expected to come to the workshops with an openness to various approaches toward literature and writing. Classes are supplemented by weekly one-on-one conferences with instructors as well as optional electives.  
Courses in creative writing are offered in conjunction with the Writing Program at Columbia University’s School of the Arts. Overseen by Chair of Creative Writing Lis Harris, Professor Alan Ziegler, and Director of Creative Writing for Pre-College Programs Christina Rumpf, the creative writing courses are designed to challenge and engage students interested in literary creation, providing them with a substantial foundation for further exploration of their creative work.",,,,10762,Morningside,K0100-20222-002,Creative Writing: Introdu,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),WRTI,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRTI/K0100-20222-002/,,In-Person,Pre-College Programs,0,,,20222WRTI0100K002,REGISTRATION

ZOO_ PS0100,Inside the Animal Mind: What Animals Thi,"Do rats laugh? Do dogs pretend? Can birds use tools? While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.  This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology—the study of animal minds—and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin’s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the “father of cognitive ethology,” whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.  In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson. These pioneering researchers fundamentally changed our understanding of the animal mind, shedding new light on the extraordinary and diverse abilities of our fellow species to learn, problem-solve, use tools, express emotions, and even mourn their dead. What’s more, we are learning that animals communicate complex information in ways we could never have imagined.  Field excursions to locations such as the Central Park Zoo, the Wild Bird Fund, and the Wolf Conservation Center offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behaviors up close, emulate observation techniques used by scientists in the field, and speak to experts about their research. These first-hand experiences provide context for the material covered in class, and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions. Students also have an opportunity to explore the broad array of academic and career paths that relate to cognitive ethology, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, conservation biology, psychology, philosophy and ethics, co",Michelle A Ashkin,3:10pm,5:00pm,10760,Morningside,K0100-20222-002,Inside the Animal Mind,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ZOO_,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ZOO_/K0100-20222-002/,607 Hamilton Hall,In-Person,,0,,MTWRF,20222ZOO_0100K002,LECTURE
