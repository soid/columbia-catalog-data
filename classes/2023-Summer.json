    "course_descr":"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?\nThe course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models \u2013 models that use\nfinancial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements \u2013 but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models \u2013 but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that\nyou have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private\nequity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",

The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.\nManaging any modern firm requires information about the firm\u2019s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.\nThe focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization\u2019s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors\u2019 internal-reporting mistakes.\nTo attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.\nWe will examine the following key topics:\nDesigning managerial information systems to support an organization\u2019s strategy.\nDetermining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.\nEvaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.\nThe capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.\nThe limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.\nActivity-based costing and activity-based management.\nEstimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.\nRelevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.\nThe information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.\nThe incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",

By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.\nCourse content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm\u2019s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:\n1. Understand the firm\u2019s strategy. We will assess the firm\u2019s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.\n2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.\n3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.\n4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.\n5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm\u2019s current value. \nIn the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",

Klein\n  \nThis undergraduate seminar will explore the ducal chapel and state state church of San Marco in Venice in the context of the city\u2019s medieval art and architecture. Built to house the body of the Evangelist St. Mark within the precinct of the ducal palace shortly after its translation from Alexandria in 828\/29, the church of San Marco replaced an earlier ducal chapel dedicated to St. Theodore as the primary site of state ceremonies and soon developed into the most prominent shrine dedicated to the evangalist in Italy. Rebuilt and expanded several times between the first half of the ninth and the mid-eleventh centuries, the architecture of the church of San Marco was heavily indebted not only to Byzantine art and architectural traditions, but also to ceremonial traditions rooted in the Byzantine empire. Accordingly, this seminar will focus on Venetian perceptions of Byzantine art and culture from the time of the foundation of San Marco through the collapse of the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1261 and beyond with a particular emphasis on the role of Venice as a cultural and artistic mediator between Byzantium and the medieval West. Emphasis will be placed on the function of Late Roman and Byzantine architectural spolia and saintly relics as markers of cultural and religious identity, the invention and visual manifestation of cult traditions, and changes in the sacred topography of San Marco as a result of Venice\u2019s expansions on the mainland and in the Eastern Mediterranean following the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 and its struggles against rival city states, Genoa first among them.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n\u00a0\nColumbia in Venice\n\u00a0\nprogram through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n\u00a0\nGlobal Learning Scholarships\u00a0\navailable.\u00a0\nTuition\n\u00a0charges apply.\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates.",

Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context.

This course will revisit historic and contemporary design methods, artifacts, and visions to better see the ways we conceive of, represent, and mobilize design to act on the world. Design will be presented across multiple scales--from the molecular to the bodily to the planetary--as both a normalizing and potentially subversive tool. We will question its limitations and push its capacity to address existing inequities through activist and interdisciplinary approaches. Guest speakers and field trips will supplement lectures and readings. Students will apply concepts presented in class to exercises conducted in design workshops.",

An aim of this course is to enable students to identify and ultimately enter into\n focused, art-historical conversations and to understand their positioning within the broader\n discourse.

    "course_descr":"The ethics of medicine, biology, and psychology deeply influence our ideas about gender and sexuality and how we establish what is \u201cnormal\u201d about our sexed bodies. Even the most basic questions about gender identity, for example, or how we distinguish male from female (or that we distinguish at all), have been shaped by the culture of science and medicine.\n  \nIn this class, we will examine traditional gender and sex binaries, including how they have been prescribed and enforced throughout American medical history, up to the present day. For example, people have always been born with intersex traits, and yet only in recent times have physicians intervened to manage such births. Before the 1840s, in the U.S. those born with intersex traits lived their lives the best they could, despite their physical differences, largely without medical interference. Since the 19th century, however, physicians have tried to surgically \u201ccorrect\u201d people (adults) with atypical genitals, even if that surgical management was medically unnecessary and conflicted with the person\u2019s gender identity. Since the 1950s, providers have sought to \u201cfix\u201d those born with intersex conditions in infancy, before their gender identities had a chance to develop. Though physicians thought they were helping their patients live better lives, the principles we now associate with bioethics (autonomy and informed consent, for example) were too often neglected and took a backseat to physicians\u2019 assumptions about what \u201cbetter lives\u201d might entail.",

Thus, questions about how humans ought to relate both to their own environment and to other living beings on this planet fall squarely within the field of bioethics. While some observers may see bioethics as concerning only the health of human beings defined narrowly, bioethics in fact has many implications for the larger biosphere and vice versa.\u00a0\n  \nThis course discusses important issues at the nexus of bioethics and the\u00a0environment, including climate change, ozone shield depletion, soil erosion, ocean pollution, diminishing biodiversity-all among the\u00a0environmental\u00a0factors with adverse consequences for the health of both human and non-human beings.\u00a0Even\u00a0the technologies employed in health-\ncare\u00a0\nhave\u00a0environmental\u00a0impact harmful\u00a0\nto\u00a0\nhealth.\n  \nAmong the challenges to be addressed: How can healthcare be made \u201cgreen\u201d?\u00a0 What do present generations \u201cowe\u201d to future generations? What is\u00a0environmental\u00a0justice in the relations between developed and developing societies? How should humans relate to the other inhabitants of this planet?",

    "course_descr":"Given the impact of technological tools and advancements in todays modern economy, it has become increasingly imperative for business professionals and professional graduate students to have a top-down understanding of some of the most relevant, applicable, and highly technical topics such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and digital tokens (among others). This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters. Please note absence from the first day of class will result in automatic forfeiture of students' registration. Auditing is not permitted (no exceptions).",

The study tour may well be the EMBA class with the strongest impact on your career.\nThe week in Tel Aviv will expose you to one of the world\u2019s most vibrant tech communities which thrives although it is geographically distant from its main markets and funding sources.  \nAt the end of the week you will be able to form your own views about the drivers of Israel\u2019s tech success and its likely future curse.   You will establish familiarity with that unusual culture with which you may find yourself doing business in the future.  Moreover, you\u2019ll take away invaluable general insights to guide you in your own career.\nCompeting for your attention will be Tel Aviv itself.  The town\u2019s sidewalks are lined with crowded cafes.  It has a lively night scene with pubs, bars and clubs that keep their doors open until the early morning hours.   It stretches along the Mediterranean\u2019s sandy beaches where the water is pleasantly warm, swimmable year round.  In short, Tel Aviv is a young person\u2019s heaven.",

Business leaders are expected to lead diverse teams and support DEI, yet little formal education is provided to leaders in the field on the subject. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundations addresses this gap by introducing the fundamental concepts, frameworks, and theories that inform how we as leaders make meaning of diversity, equity, and inclusion personally and professionally. This course is an excellent opportunity for those interested in developing their ability to; understand and engage in conversations about diversity and inclusion; develop the ability to speak to the role DEI will play in their professional career; explore how their own identities relate to various systems of power, inclusion, and exclusion and contribute to building a more equitable workplace. Engaging with DEI is no longer a choice -- it is imperative. By the end of this course, students will have a working knowledge of the fundamental aspects of DEI and the tools required to engage in this work.",

These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \\ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev\u2019s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of \u201ctruth\u201d in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.\n  \nAppropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

We will explore the different worlds Alexander grew out of, confronted, and affected: the old Greek world, the Persian empire, the ancient near-east (Egypt, Levant, Babylonia, Iran), and the worlds beyond, namely pre-Islamic (and pre-Silk Road) Central Asia, the Afghan borderlands, and the Indus valley. The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",

Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent, synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies, from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.\n \n This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world eventsin which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year long with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold-spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighbourhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.\n \n Guided by recent literature quantitative and qualitative frameworks that aim at assessing current and future climate risks to turn them into actionable informa",

    "course_descr":"In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the international community vowed to \u201creach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,\u201d and to achieve \u201crapid emissions reductions thereafter.\u201d Despite that, however, global emissions continue to increase. The lack of progress has spurred interest in the possibility of removing greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere. Modelling by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that atmospheric greenhouse gas removal (GHGR) could help to combat climate change in three ways. First, GHGR could be used to reduce net emissions in the short-term, while countries are in the process of decarbonizing. Second, GHGR could be used to offset residual emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors (e.g., aviation) and thus achieve net-zero emissions. Third, in the longer-term, GHGR could be used to achieve net-negative emissions if deployed at levels exceeding residual emissions.\n \n Scientists have proposed a variety of GHGR techniques, but questions remain about their efficacy, benefits, and risks. Technical feasibility is not the only consideration as large-scale deployment of GHGR could raise a host of social, ethical, and governance issues. For example, some climate activists have argued GHGR may discourage action to reduce emissions, and further entrench fossil fuel use. Others have expressed concern about the equity and justice implications of deploying GHGR, arguing\n that it could exacerbate existing inequalities and place the most vulnerable at greater risk. Existing governance frameworks may not be effective in preventing these negative outcomes nor maximizing the benefits of GHGR.\n \n This course will explore possible technique for large-scale GHGR. We will discuss the feasibility of deploying different techniques, with a particular focus on the ethical, social, and governance issues that large-scale deployment could raise. We will also consider strategies for advancing just and equitable deployment and explore the role of different actors (e.g., governments, the private sector, and civil society) in ensuring that occurs.",

    "course_descr":"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional\n effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a \u201cwhole of community\u201d approach to disaster management.\n \n The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management.

    "course_descr":"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted\n qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi\n Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the\n many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless\n forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the\n contributions of the Jews to their so called \u201chost cultures\u201d by way of diverse media\u2014literary and non-fictional\n works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end\n of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been\n intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.\n \n All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages\n is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to\n consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request. This course will be of interest to those\n majoring in Slavic and\/or Jewish Studies, as well as anyone interested in Comparative Literature, History, Art\n History, and Film and Visual Studies.",

Content strategy provides a holistic approach for unlocking the value behind content and for increasing its effectiveness in achieving business and organizational objectives. This course will present the fundamentals of content strategy and explore the discipline\u2019s approaches, techniques, and tools that course participants can apply directly to the content situation in their own organization. It will draw parallels with \u2013 and highlight distinctions among \u2013 traditional communication strategy, publishing, and content strategy, and provide students with a framework to create a sustainable program grounded in meaningful, actionable content.",

    "course_descr":"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don\u2019t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds \u2014 structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works \u2014 creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",

    "course_title":"THE THEATER OF THE ABSURD",
    "course_descr":"The theater of the absurd was a theatrical movement that emerged in Paris in the 1950s. Plays such as Samuel Beckett\u2019s \nWaiting for Godot\n and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s \nThe Bald Soprano\n challenged the conventions of traditional theater, staging a darkly humorous, \u201cabsurd\u201d vision of human existence. In this course, we will conduct close readings of some of the major plays of the movement, and explore its links to the Existentialist philosophy of post-WWII France (especially the philosophy of Albert Camus). We will pay particular attention to the social and political context of the movement\u2019s emergence; the challenge to conventions of bourgeois drama; popular and critical reception of the plays.  After brief contextualization of the period to be studied and some indications as to how to read dramatic texts, we will proceed to a close analysis of the text, performance and reception of some of the key works of the theater of the absurd, beginning with Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco\u2019s \nThe Bald Soprano \nand T\nhe Lesson\n, followed by Samuel Beckett's\u00a0Waiting for \nGodot\n\u00a0(1953). Analysis of these plays will allow us to identify the primary characteristics and themes of absurdist drama (purposelessness and hopelessness of human existence; godlessness of the modern world; futility of action; collapse of logic; impossibility of communication etc) as well as the hallmarks of the absurdist theatrical style (its debt to mime, vaudeville, and the circus; the use of humor, ritual, and violence; theater within theater; absence of action\/plot etc). With a good grasp of what constitutes absurd theater we will then familiarize ourselves with some of its literary and intellectual origins: the existentialist philosophy of J.-P. Sartre and especially Albert Camus (\u201cThe Myth of Sisyphus\u201d); parallels to absurdism in the writings of Franz Kafka; Antonin Artaud\u2019s \"theater of cruelty\u201d; Alfred Jarry\u2019s\u00a0\nUbu Roi\n\u00a0(1896); the manifestos of the Italian Futurist F.T. Marinetti; the \"static drama\" of the Belgian Symbolist Maurice Maeterlinck.",

    "course_descr":"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing\/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.\n  \nA primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.\n  \nBy the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.\n  \nNote:\n\u00a0While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",

    "course_descr":"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology\/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,\" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, \"Firm Boundaries,\" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, \"Internal Operations,\" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, \"New Challenges,\" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.\"",

    "course_title":"Sports Analytics",
    "course_descr":"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. \nStudents are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the \"laboratory\" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",

Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 \/day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",

Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in role plays, to keep a weekly journal in which they analyze their negotiation experiences, and to participate in a final project comprising a 60 to 90-minute one-on-one negotiation and a 10 page written analysis of that negotiation.\u00a0\n  \nBecause of the experiential and team-based nature of the coursework, class attendance is required. If you anticipate missing more than one class session, you should not take the course. Unanticipated absences due to illness or similar supervening circumstances will be accommodated as is reasonable; makeup activities may be required as part of the accommodation. \"",

We will understand how it has inspired and been applied to business and impact models, and, even mindsets to improve the creation of public value in areas such as health, human services, workforce and small business development. We will also consider the challenges and limitations that have been experienced as social enterprise has been deployed through for-profit and nonprofit entities. Finally, we will explore how the public and private sectors at-large could better support social enterprises to launch, scale and generate greater positive impacts.",

    "course_title":"FEMINIST LIFE WRITING",
    "course_descr":"Feminists have famously claimed that \"the personal is political.\" Accordingly, life writing--in various genres--has been an important form for feminists across generations. In this class, we will explore the different ways in which feminists have used these modes to create visions of the self, to challenge the roles and self-images given to them, and to imagine new narratives. In particular, we'll explore questions of genre: so many of these writers have developed hybrid genres or challenged the boundaries of genre in order to write their lives. Looking at examples of life writing including letters, diaries and journals, graphic memoirs, and \"traditional\" autobiographies, we will examine these forms through the lens of gender, race, sexuality, class, and disability. Readings are subject to change, but may include: Audre Lorde, \nZami\n; Alison Bechdel, \nFun Home\n; Cherrie Moraga,\n Loving in the War Years\n; Maggie Nelson, \nThe Argonauts\n; Maxine Hong Kingston, \nWoman Warrior\n; poems by Adrienne Rich; Carmen Maria Machado, \nIn the Dream House\n; \nThis Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color\n; Janet Mock, \nRedefining Realness\n, and selected shorter pieces. Additionally, we will read critical and theoretical works that will urge us to consider our primary texts from various critical approaches: including sexuality studies, critical race studies, disability studies, and transgender studies.",

Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into account the particularities of each author\u2019s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious or political contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and represented in literature? How do these authors represent the intersections of queerness with race, class, ethnicity, disability and citizenship? How have queer narratives developed over time and across cultures in conversation with local and global modes of conceptualizing gender and sexuality? How do queer authors utilize the particularities of each genre to create new forms of self-expression?\n  \nTexts will span various genres such as short stories, poems, memoirs, graphic novels, novels and personal essays by authors such as James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Sappho, Carmen Maria Machado, Alison Bechdel, Adrienne Rich, Casey Plett and Imogen Binnie. Additionally, we will read critical and theoretical works that will urge us to consider these works from a range of perspectives, such as queer studies, feminist studies, disability studies, and transgender studies.",

On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester\u2019s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare\u2019s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages. We read 8 plays in all, including Titus Andronicus, Midsummer Night's Dream, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Merchant of Venice, and Hamlet.",

By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.

    "course_descr":"New media is nothing new. New media historians trace rich record of the moments when some new textual technology entered the public sphere and provoked responses ranging from widespread anxiety and to revolutionary fervor. We will examine the cultural anxieties that attend new media, stretching from Plato\u2019s \nPhaedrus\n\u2014where Socrates warns that the advent of writing will destroy people\u2019s memories\u2014to today, when Nicholas Carr asks \u201cIs Google making us stupid?\u201d The clay tablet, the codex, the printing press, the chalkboard, the telegraph, the typewriter, the pdf, computer coding, and the smart phone have each promised to revolutionize the reading and writing publics, access to power, and even how people think.\n  \nThis course examines those promises within their historical contexts, through critical study, and using hands-on experiences. For instance, we will study the role of clay tablets in upholding ancient empires at the same time that we craft our own clay tablet texts. We will take notes with ink pens while we study the role of Medieval scribes in spreading Christianity and Islam. We will create \u2018zines while studying the Riot Grrl movement. And we will create our own html hypertexts (no prior coding experience required) as we read the earliest hypertext fiction. These hands-on experiences move arguments about the dangers and revelations of writing technologies out of the realm of the hypothetical and into the realm of the experiential.\n  \nThe class will visit Columbia\u2019s Rare Book and Manuscript Library (RBML) and Barnard\u2019s Zine Archive, where we will look at textual artifacts, from ancient papyri to early print and digital texts. Our approach will prepare you to situate the contemporary textual technologies you take for granted (IMs, Twitter, Google Docs, and so on) within the long history of new media. And it will teach those pursuing literary studies, new media studies, and computer science research methods required to examine a text as a technology.",

Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as \u201cnew television.\u201d That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: \u201cI\u2019d been thinking: it\u2019s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.\u00a0 But lately I\u2019m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.\u00a0 That the best is over,\u201d Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.\u00a0 Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order): \nThe Sopranos\n; \nThe Wire\n; \nDeadwood\n; \nMadmen\n; and \nBreaking Bad.",

It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.\u201d Annie Dillard, The Writing Life \u201cFind a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, \u201cWhat do I know?,\u201d and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",

    "course_descr":"In this course, we\u2019ll explore the use of violence in short stories and fiction. We\u2019ll look\n at how violence, be it emotional, political, or physical, can serve to develop conflict\n and character in fiction. How does fictional violence serve to disrupt and unsettle\n not only the narrative, but the reader as well? To explore this, we\u2019ll move from the\n philosophical exploration of violence in works by Dostoyevsky and Moravia to the\n more raucous display in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Westerns and Highsmith and\n Thompson\u2019s noirs, from the repressed, lurking violence in short stories by writers\n Such as Carver and Gaitskill to the textual violence found in postmodern writers like\n Acker. Along the way, we\u2019ll meet assassins, prisoners, skinheads, schoolgirls, and\n gangsters. How and why do these characters excite or repel us? How far can we\n push the characters in our own fiction, and how far should we? How can violence\n illuminate the larger political or societal forces that exist in specific moments of\n history? How does violence in fiction create an often unexpected, yet deeply\n significant, catharsis and consequence?",

As a hybrid of creative writing and performance workshops, students will spend half the semester focusing on the written word. Students will perform weekly exercises to practice and explore traditional forms, discuss predecessors of American performance poetry, and offer critical exegesis on each other\u2019s work. The second half of the class will be spent in performance. We will study current spoken word performances, voice training techniques, and intersections between acting and poetic theories. Students will critique each other\u2019s individual deliveries, collaborate on group performances, and ultimately construct an hour long performance synthesizing a semester\u2019s worth of work. Readings will include such authors as Sonia Sanchez, Bushra Rehman, Franny Choi, Morgan Parker, and Ntosake Shange.",

    "course_descr":"In The Arguments in Your Head: Playwriting Workshop, we\u2019ll explore and develop the foundational skills, techniques, and instincts that you\u2019ll need to write a full-length play. The goal of this class is not to write a perfect play (doesn\u2019t exist!) Rather, the goal is to let go of what you think you should be writing to impress others and instead learn to become the stewards of your own urgent questions and aesthetics principles. This workshop will be process-focused rather than outcome-focused. As your teacher, my concern is not perfection\u2014 I care about pulse. Everyone will be bringing in new, unfinished work that is a little raw and uncomfortable. No one knows what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019re all in the same boat! My goal for you is not to get stuck when you get lost (because if I do my job right you will get lost), but instead I hope to give you tools that help you find your way in the dark, take bold risks, and above all keep going. Every play is different and has its own rules. In order to fashion those rules autonomously we have to learn to listen deeply, follow an inarticulate hunch, and above all, be willing to fail. Be brave, playwright! This is where the wildness lives, where all the scary fun is to be had. And in the end\u2026 it\u2019s just words on a page, ink on paper\u2014 you can always tear it up and start over. By the end of this class, you will have written a draft of a full-length play, learned how to give thoughtful feedback on the plays of your classmates, and developed a more critical eye to the plays that you read.",

While Black Harlem forms the focal point of our investigation, the wide varieties of identities that found a home in uptown Manhattan, from the Native American, Dutch, and British periods, to the early American era, to the rise of German, Italian, Jewish, and Latinx Harlem, to the \"New Renaissance\" currently underway uptown, are also covered. Of particular interest is the role of women in Harlem, as farmers and traders in the Native American, Colonial, and early American periods, to writers, musicians, and sculptors during the Harlem Renaissance, to the current generation of uptown politicians, artists, and educators. A special bonus will be twice-weekly walking tours, including the opportunity to conduct oral histories with contemporary Harlemites.",

The course will take place over five 4-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will cover multiple analysis topics and will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods including descriptions of their relationship to causal inference and a discussion with examples of the types of study designs and data the methods can be used with. Following the lecture will be a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises to give them hands on experience implementing the anlytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis ans present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset).",

After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics \u2013 consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly \u2018Kantianism\u2019 and \u2018contractualism\u2019), and some of the traditions of \u2018virtue ethics\u2019. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech.\u00a0\n  \nOur authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois.\u00a0\n  \nThe course has three main goals for students: \n1\n) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives \u2013 historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western \u2013 on ethics; \n2\n) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct\u00a0(logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; \n3\n) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly.\u00a0\n  \nThere are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",

    "course_descr":"Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood\u2019s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as \u201cmarginal\u201d or \u201cperipheral\u201d cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet\u2026 are these motion pictures really \u201csecondary\u201d? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called \u201calternative women\u2019s cinema\u201d at the core of film history.\u00a0Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women\u2019s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, V\u011bra Chytilov\u00e1, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertm\u00fcller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler.

Called \u201cnew waves\u201d or \u201cnew cinemas,\u201d these movements, made up of young filmmakers, would challenge the cinematic industrial structures in each of their respective nations, as well propose both radically different approaches to filmmaking and to cinematic storytelling. Perhaps inevitably, these films and filmmakers would also be drawn into larger political discussions about the futures of their respective nations. This course will explore three important examples of this development\u2014the French New Wave, the Japanese New Wave and the Brazilian Cinema Novo\u2014detailing both the commonalities among these movements (aesthetic, social, technological, political) as well those factors which made each unique. Among the filmmakers included will be Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Nagisa Oshima, and Glauber Rocha. The relationship of these respective \u201cnew waves\u201d to simultaneous radical experiments in visual arts, theater, literature and music will be a special focus of the course. A watershed moment in film history that would forever change the way films were made, financed, seen and discussed.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\n \nColumbia Summer in \nParis\n program through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\u00a0).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply\n \n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates.",

Yet this \u00abNuevo cine mexicano\u00bb cannot be understood without knowing the traditions of Mexico\u2019s intricate film history. This course explores the numerous tendencies of Mexican cinema through the analysis of its most representative genres, features, and directors since the so called Golden Age (1938-1957). An in-depth analysis of films such as Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s\u00a0\nLa perla\n\u00a0(1947), Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s\u00a0\nLos olvidados\u00a0\n(1950), Jomi Garc\u00eda Ascot\u2019s and Mar\u00eda Luisa El\u00edo's\u00a0\nEn el balc\u00f3n vac\u00edo\n\u00a0(1962), Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s\u00a0\nLa monta\u00f1a sagrada\n\u00a0(1973), and Arturo Ripstein's\u00a0\nProfundo carmes\u00ed\n\u00a0(1996) will contribute to define the characteristics of the most relevant \u00abnational\u00bb genres \u2013 from 1940s melodramas to 1970s psychedelic movies and 1990s crime films. The study of the New Mexican Cinema of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\nAmores perros\n, 2000), Cuar\u00f3n (\nY tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\n, 2001), and del Toro (\nEl laberinto del fauno\n, 2006) will comprise an examination of the complex relationship between the US and Mexican film industries, as well as a critique of the very notion of \u00abnational identity\u00bb in today\u2019s globalized world. We will also analyze new tendencies in commercial, experimental, and documentary Mexican films \u2013 including Carlos Reygadas'\u00a0\nLuz silenciosa\n\u00a0(2007) and Pedro Gonz\u00e1lez\u00a0\nRubio's Alamar\u00a0\n(2009).",

In this seminar we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary production, including projects created within the media industries of Mexico, Peru, India, China, Cambodia, and Israel. We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR\/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda. This course fulfills the Global Core requirement.",

The student should expect at the conclusion of this course to have gained a level of competency in M&A commensurate with an entry-level investment banking associate in M&A. Whether or not the student \"practices\" M&A, the course will afford the student with an insider's look into what is an undeniable major force on today's corporate landscape.

Classes are conducted in German and supplemented with written homework and audiovisual materials. Assignments and activities are diversified to integrate undergraduate and graduate students\u2019 academic and personal interests. The program draws on the German heritage of New York City (museums, Goethe Institut, restaurants, etc.). Students are encouraged to attend German-language films and musical performances. Students have many opportunities for informal conversation. Upon successful completion of the course (with a minimum grade of B), students should achieve novice high to intermediate low proficiency (ACTFL scale). Final grades are based on frequent oral and written tests, writing assignments, a project on German culture in New York, and a final examination (written and oral). Students are advised that this course constitutes a full-time commitment. The workload of this course is very intense and students will be expected to spend 4-6 hours studying every day outside of class and additional time on weekends.

This course consists of three parts.The first part (weeks 1 and 2) introduces students to public humanities and Greek history and culture, is structured around an examination of\u00a0\nSNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece\n, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).\n  \nThe second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.\n  \nThroughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).\n  \nCourse Objectives\n: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia. \nThe \nStavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative\n (SNFPHI) is sponsoring the program and will cover the cost of the\nVergil",

It is intended to provide students with competencies to understand why workers seek union representation, understand the legal and regulatory framework surrounding labor relations, and develop critical thinking skills to address changing expectations around DEIA, business ethics, and generational pressures. Grounded in a review of the labor movement\u2019s historical underpinnings in the U.S. and globally (ex. China, Japan, Korea, EU, Great Britain), the course will provide a comprehensive examination of labor relations topics ranging from union organizing, collective bargaining and contract administration, to incipient issues such as unionization in new industries and work groups, the impact of shareholder and customer pressures, and potential contradictions between a company\u2019s stated ethical principles and its day-to-day labor relations decisions.\n  \nThe course is designed for current or aspiring HCM and other professionals seeking to develop their capabilities to provide strategic labor relations guidance within their organizations. The objective is to impart a sophisticated understanding of why workers unionize, examine effective management responses to unionization, and master the legal and ethical framework in which these activities take place. Students will acquire skills to address existing and emerging labor relations issues facing organizations, competencies in foundational legal and compliance issues, and the ability to address strategic and practical challenges that impact the labor-management relationship.

Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",

This course aims to place Latina\/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:\u00a0 Who are Latinas\/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?\u00a0 Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?\u00a0 The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.\u00a0 Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.\u00a0 The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups\u2014Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration.

    "course_descr":"Few periods in history have stirred imaginations and been debated as much as the so-called \u201cAge of Revolution\u201d at the turn of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Long seen through a self-righteous North-Atlantic lens, this era of (democratic) revolutions has today been decentered both spatially and conceptually to encompass other revolutionary upheavals around the globe and their twin other: empire. This course takes stock of these developments to explore how revolution and empire developed in tandem in France and Haiti, with ramifications across the Caribbean, Europe and beyond from 1789 to 1820. Topics covered include: the end of an \u201cold\u201d regime and birth of several new ones; the largest and most successful slave revolt in history; revolutionary politics and social transformation; the terror; Napoleon, Toussaint Louverture, and charismatic leadership; the first \u201ctotal war\u201d and new forms of empire-building; the legacies, memory, and forgetting of these events. Throughout, the course considers revolutionary upheaval and imperialism as intertwined processes driven both by determinate logics and by unintended consequences.\n  \nThis course is lecture-based although students are expected to engage in short document-based discussions in class. All classes and readings will be English, and no prior knowledge of the period is required.",

    "course_descr":"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current \u2018memory wars\u2019 in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa. Group(s): B, C Field(s): AFR, MEU",

In the US gun violence against children has increased, as part of a broader nationwide rise in crime. School shootings have also risen: The Washington Post counted 42 last year in the U.S., the most on record and up from 27 in 2019.\u00a0 In addition to exploring its underlying causes, the prevalence, and solutions to gun violence in homes, schools, and communities in the United States, young peoples\u2019 participation in legislation and other efforts to address physical insecurity. In the second half of the course, students examine the ways in which US foreign policy\u2013 including in the areas of small arms waivers, direct gun sales, and migration, have shaped the lives of young people in other nations. The focus of this part of the course will be on Central America where armed violence has had a dramatic impact on young people and has resulted in forced displacement and loss of education for young people. Throughout the course, students will explore the gun-related human rights issues affecting young people through the study of cases, reports, documentaries, and other visual images including satellites and aerial images. Students will examine the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 2250 and 2419-- the Youth Peace and Security Agenda (YPS), the Arms Trade Treaty, and the Optional Protocol on the Child Soldier, as well as the U.S. Youth Peace and Security Act of 2021 (HR 4838), national legislation that prioritizes the inclusion of youth in conflict resolution and recognizes that youth participation is a key component of U.S. peace and security strategy. An ongoing and significant consideration in the course will be the role of international education efforts and youth-led advocacy and legislative efforts around gun control legislation.\u00a0\n  \nIn addition to the topics mentioned above, students will acquire and deepen their understandings\n  \n  \nthe framing of gun violence and violence caused by small weapons as human rights issues for young people, including but not limited to the international and national human rights laws that protect the right to life, development, survival, and protection\n  \nthe impacts that race, ethnicity, gender, age, life experience all have on the realization of young people\u2019s human rights\u00a0 \u00a0\n  \nthe debates surroun",

The extraordinary richness of musical life in New York is thus an integral part of the course. Although not a history of Western music, the course is taught in a chronological format and includes masterpieces by Josquin des Prez, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, among others. No previous knowledge of music required. Columbia University undergraduates who need this course for graduation are encouraged to register during early registration.",

What is unusual about foreign exchange is that although it can rightfully claim to be the largest of all financial markets, it remains an area where very few have any meaningful experience. Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives\u2014given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most of that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least comparatively speaking, a fact that makes the foreign exchange market an ideal platform for derivatives. The emphasis is on familiarizing the student with the nature of the foreign exchange\u00a0market and those factors that make it special among financial markets, enabling the student to gain a deeper understanding of the related market for derivatives on foreign exchange.",

    "course_descr":"The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with the typical phases of an internal or external consulting project. The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,\u00a0 phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A\u00a0 typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor\/client\u00a0 relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a\u00a0 variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or\u00a0 product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and\u00a0 the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and\u00a0 proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.\u00a0\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0 Successful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the\u00a0 client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on\u00a0 the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to\u00a0 work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual\u00a0 and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing\u00a0 expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability\u00a0 to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.\u00a0 During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,\u00a0 processes, and social factors that promote successful change.\u00a0\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0\n  \n\u00a0 This course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external\u00a0 organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives.

There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:\n  \n\u00a0\n  \n  \nsocial networks\n  \ncommunities of practice (or knowledge-networks),\n  \nopen source,\n  \nopen data, and\n  \nopen innovation.\n \n  \n\u00a0\n  \nStudents will envision, diagnose and design networks for \u201ccooperative advantage.\u201d We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, social influence, sustainability challenges, and technology advancement.",

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

We explore the role of American political culture, the presidency, Congress, and the foreign policy bureaucracy in helping to determine America's relationship with other states and international organizations. We pay particular attention to the recurring tensions that run through American foreign policy: isolationism v. internationalism, security v. prosperity, diplomacy v. military power, unilateralism v. multilateralism, and realism v. idealism. Each week we will explore a broad theoretical\/conceptual theme and then focus on a specific topic that exemplifies a practical application of the theme.",

From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example.\u00a0It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from\u00a0intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication. Major themes of study will be: national security fundamentals; concepts of war, conflict, and special operations; and the use of special operations forces over time.",

It provides historical perspectives on the development of today's Ukraine, analyzes the evolution of its politics since independence, and delves into its quest for Euro-Atlantic integration. While providing an assessment of political, social, and economic transformations, the course examines major causes of Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity. The current political situation in the country and the current war with Russia will be thoroughly investigated. The top priority of Ukraine's foreign policy is to ensure international support for its efforts to rebuff Russia\u2019s full-fledged aggression and to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Can diplomacy still play a role? What is to be done to solve existing internal problems? What is to be done to restore the country? Can Ukraine\u2019s president, its government, and parliament solve all these problems? Is there a future for UN peacekeeping operations in Ukraine? These and other issues, including international assistance to Ukraine, behind-the-scenes activities, power struggles, and diplomatic endeavors are analyzed in the course. The course delivers first-hand insight by a\n\u00a0\ncareer diplomat who has been actively involved in the implementation of Ukraine's foreign policy and closely connected with the upper echelons of the country's political establishment.",

There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war. The examination of risks to journalists on conflict beats will include detailed case studies of real kidnappings and battlefield deaths, and study examples of risk mitigation and best practices in the field. The course is intended for students with a deep interest in war, terrorism and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners.

If not, then how can we know that this is not the case \u2013 what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario?

And would it make any ethical difference \u2013 would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways \u2013 if we actually are living in the Matrix?\n  \nIn attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato\u2019s\u00a0\nRepublic\n\u00a0and Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019\u00a0\nMeditations\n, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.\n  \nThis course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students\u2019 abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.\n  \nBeyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",

The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a prior i background in the life sciences is assumed.\n  \nThis course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics. Math majors, joint majors, and math concentrators must take MATH UN2010 Linear Algebra, which focuses on linear algebra concepts\u00a0and foundations that are needed for upper-level math courses. MATH UN2015 (Linear Algebra and Probability) does NOT replace MATH UN2010 (Linear Algebra) as prerequisite requirements of math courses. Students may not receive full credit for both courses MATH UN2010 and MATH UN2015.",

The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the \u201cGlobal Core.\u201d The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world\u2014where the false binaries of \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe Rest\u201d no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",

We examine the forces that have underpinned\n migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions\n in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an\n object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a \u2018total social fact\u2019 involving political,\n social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres\n and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with\n questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between\n politics and the arts.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course through the \nColumbia Summer in Paris\n program, you must apply to the through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply.\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates",

    "course_descr":"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.\n  \nWe critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n  \nStudents engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",

    "course_descr":"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one\u2019s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.\n  \nThis course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?\n  \nParticipants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies\u2014and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.\n  \nWe approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines\/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.\n  \nOutside of class, students read articles on migration theory as well as various case studies, including life stories of young migrants in Europe, accounts of the border crisis in the US, and testimonies from DACA recipients.

    "course_descr":"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials\u2014the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today\u2019s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures\u2014bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures\u2014light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.\n  \nIn this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.\n  \nStudents investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia\u2019s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",

As the healthcare industry continues to rapidly evolve, it provides immense opportunities for learning and applying concepts, theories and research related to negotiation and conflict resolution in procurement of medical devices and difficult conversations such as advanced directives to name a few. This course is applicable not only to students pursuing careers in health care, but is also designed for students who are interested in applying negotiation skills that they have learned in an environment that can be emotionally charged and conceptually complex.\u00a0\n  \nThroughout this course students will be given the opportunity to apply the skills they have learned from previous classes as well as solidify key concepts including but not limited to negotiation preparation, quantitative\/qualitative analysis, influence, social cognition, asymmetrical information, and conflict resolution in a healthcare context. This course is designed to challenge each student to harness their critical thinking skills, uncover nuances and recognize the complexities associated with multiparty negotiations in healthcare. This course aims to enable students to develop and implement strategic processes that help bring parties together and promote new perspectives that will bridge the gap between the classroom and real-life scenarios.\u00a0\n  \nDuring the course, students will gain insight into the history of the US healthcare system as well as the changing dynamics associated with the Health Care Reform, and end of life discussions. This course will emphasize the role of negotiations from multiple perspectives and will utilize an expert panel videos of such subject matter experts as hospital administrators\/executives, physicians and medical device manufacturers in order to provide historical case studies as well as review real-life negotiations. Students will actively engage in negotiation planning and role plays, read case studies and other materials about negotiation and the healthcare field, as well as, use industry software to help them prepare for negotiations.",

    "course_descr":"This introductory core course examines the central role of marketing and communications in fulfilling the mission of nonprofit institutions of all types and at all stages of development. The programmatic objective of this course is to build a shared set of competencies and understandings around the power, practices, ethical applications, and desired outcomes of nonprofit marketing and communications.\n  \nDramatic changes across civil society in recent years, including the evolving role of nonprofits in democratic discourse and the rise of new forms of communications technologies, means that nonprofit leaders today must have a fundamental understanding of the principles of marketing and communications in order to ensure organizational success both internally and externally. While outreach technologies and trends change rapidly in our era, true excellence in the field is based upon a core group of basic skills that are hardly novel: strong writing and analysis, strategic planning, and the ability to connect disparate individuals across a wide range of disciplines and diverse backgrounds to build an inclusive community around shared goals.\n  \nThis course is designed to help students gain these skills through engaging with the strategic frameworks and tactical applications needed to create and leverage a range of communications and marketing activities. The course will introduce students to multiple communications and marketing practices designed to engage key stakeholders, including donors, the media, volunteers and advocates, and additional internal and external influencers and sector leaders. Throughout the semester, the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all forms of outreach (written and oral; digital and print) will be foregrounded.\n  \nNo prior marketing or communications experience is necessary.",

    "course_descr":"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.\n  \nThe course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.\n  \nDiscussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?\n  \nSome of the topics that may be addressed include the\u00a0\nFrye and Daubert\n\u00a0standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.\n  \nThe course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",

We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds. The section will conclude with problems about the metaphysics of socially constructed kinds such as race or gender.",

Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau. Third some attention is paid to relevant contexts of application of these concepts in political society, including such political movements as anarchism, international human rights, conservative, liberal, and Marxist economic policies as well as competing models of democracy.",

What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?\n \n We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.\n \n Course readings include such influential works as Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's \"Sensations and Brain Processes,\u201d Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Mental States,\u201d and Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cWhat is it Like to be a Bat?\u201d Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.\n \n The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",

Among other topics, students can expect to focus on urban political economy, political machines and urban reform, immigration, race and ethnicity in urban politics, regional efforts to contend with economic development and crisis, federal laws and policies that have shaped today\u2019s urban environment, the day to day administration of cities, and urban problems such as fiscal strain, poverty, the burden of growth and attracting economic investment, the costs and consequences of urban terror, disaster, extreme political lability, and the evolving global city.",

    "course_descr":"PSYC3226OC:\u00a0 Nueroscience in Paris: 4 points.\n  \nInstructor: Alfredo Spagna, Department of Psychology\n  \nModern theories attempt to characterize the human mind in terms of information processing. But machines that process information do not seem to\u00a0\nfeel\u00a0\nanything; a computer may for instance receive inputs from a video camera, yet it would be hard to imagine that it\u00a0\nsees\u00a0\nor experiences the vividness of colors like we do. This course explores behaviors by understanding the influences of biological processes. What does a prototypical neuron look like? How do neurons talk to each other? How does neuronal communication produce behavior? Then we will move into asking deeper questions like: what happens in the brain when you want to move? why do we dream? How do we form memories? Nobody has yet provided a convincing theory as to how to explain the subjective nature of our mental lives in objective physical terms. Over four weeks,\u00a0\nCSP23\n\u00a0attempts to provide a strong introductory foundation to the field of human neuroscience.\n  \nEach week we will review a neuroscientific field, by following the four main components of the scientific method:\n  \n  \nObservation and formulation of scientific questions\n  \nData collection and analysis\n  \nAccurate and transparent communication of results\n  \nHigh-level discussion of the findings and future directions and societal relevance\n \n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course, you must apply to the\u00a0\n\u00a0Columbia Summer Practicum: Neuroscience in Paris\n\u00a0program, through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply.",

Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed. The methods introduced in this course will provide a toolkit with which to help measure and estimate the relationships between the smaller pieces that comprise the complex and dynamic web of systems in public health.",

The semester begins with a survey of the central elements that unite a diverse community of Muslim peoples from a variety of geographical and cultural backgrounds. This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism\/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and\/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal\/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ). The class ends by examining the efforts of American and European Muslim communities to carve out distinct spheres of identity in the larger global Muslim community ( umma) through expressions of popular culture (e.g. Hip-Hop).",

    "course_descr":"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.\n  \nCentral to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the \u201ccommodified self\u201d and \u201cself-branding.\u201d 2) \u201cDigital surveillance\u201d and the \u201cmanaged self.\u201d 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically \u201cmarginalized\u201d identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.\n  \nThe central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",

But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct \u2018race\u2019 to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",

In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution.\u00a0Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis.\u00a0\n  \nThe proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.\u00a0 It aims to:\n  \n1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.\n  \n2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.\n  \n3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.\n  \n4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.\n  \n5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",

An important goal of the class is to have students work in groups to apply economic concepts to current public policy issues having to do with urban environmental and earth systems. The use of the worlds water bodies and the atmosphere as economic inputs to production are also examined. The economics of renewable resources is described and sustainable economic development models are discussed and analyzed. Some time will also be devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn economic concepts, but they will also learn how to explain them to decision-makers.

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.\u00a0 Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked \u201cexperts only.\u201d\u00a0 The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.\u00a0 Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",

    "course_descr":"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world\u2019s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world\u2019s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2\u00b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.\n  \nStudents in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries, \u00a0data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.\n  \nThis course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",

It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG\/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.\n  \nTo understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm. The course also provides a practical introduction to selected non-financial accounting topics including sustainability reporting standards, ESG corporate performance indicators and corporate social responsibility report (CSR Reporting).",

Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the\n  \noverextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast\n  \ntechnological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of\n  \nthe disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a \u201ctake-make\u2019-\n  \nwaste\u201d manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our\n  \nplanet\u2019s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological\n  \nadvancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;\n  \nwhich begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?\n  \nThe premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative\n  \neconomic future are available to us. By looking at resources\u2019 potential, we can shape alternative methods\n  \nof procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,\n  \nproducts and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into\n  \nboth the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and\n  \nrestoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications\n  \nrequired in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially\n  \ntransformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic\n  \nstructures, systems and processes.\n  \nThis is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability\n  \nleaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us\n  \n(as rapidly as we need) into a more sustaining future.

The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.\u00a0 The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.\u00a0 For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival. The course is going to emphasize the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contribution of deforestation to climate change.",

This course situates executive\n presence alongside diversity equity and inclusion issues that arise in the technology management workplace. Core\n topics in Executive Presence Today include: 1) establishing trust and credibility as an executive; 2) interpreting and\n disrupting racism, exclusion, and bias; 3) communicating authentically; 4) driving internal and external change; and\n 5) making sound decisions in ambiguous, complex, high-stakes contexts.\n Throughout the course, you will study executive presence through the lens of technology professionals, learning\n from case studies and executives in the field from varied technology industries in corporate, mission-driven or non-\n profit, and education contexts. You will explore how to lead with poise and confidence in a technology management\n context where constant digital innovation and disruption are the norm. You will examine issues of cyber security\n decision-making where establishing credibility among senior officials may present conflicts to your values,\n identities, and closely held relationships.

Furthermore, scholarship\u00a0in sociobiology and sustainable development will raise our consciousness\u00a0about how the destruction of the material world is intimately tied to increasing stratification in the social world. Finally, we will turn our attention to the culture wars: great disagreements, misunderstandings, and contests of expressive values that include inauthentic and well-intentioned ignorance and inconsistency regarding these social movements. In this context we will also consider the political economy of knowing and being to define our own praxes for living in and\u00a0making a more enduring and just social world.",

Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the relationships between city schools and their local contexts?\u00a0 What does it mean to be a \u201cneighborhood school\u201d?\u00a0 How are spaces inside of schools racialized?\u00a0 We will use ethnographies, narrative nonfiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives.\u00a0 You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.\n \n This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.",

Recent years have seen an upswing in labor activism, including organizing campaigns and strikes at major American employers like Amazon, Kellogg\u2019s, and John Deere, as well as by schoolteachers and other workers in the public sector. Students who are curious to explore such issues will find in this course valuable tools for understanding these and other related developments, and for situating them in the larger context of American labor history, the current framework of U.S. labor relations, and global movements for workers\u2019 rights.  Each day of class will feature both a lecture session and a small group activity designed to introduce practical aspects of labor studies, such as how social scientists use data to analyze the economic effects of unions or how labor and management bargaining teams approach the task of negotiating a contract. The course is designed for high school students who may never have taken a class in economics or related disciplines but who are eager to learn more about what labor unions are, how they work, what they do, and what their larger impact is on society and the economy.",

Aware that as Judith Butler says, \u201cthe process of securing greater freedom for women requires an ongoing rethinking of this category,\u201d we use the term \u201cwoman\u201d not as a fixed position but an entry point into discussing history \u2013 specifically to interrogate and challenge comedy\u2019s all-too-long and enduring history of making a punchline out of marginalized groups. We will explore laughter as a subversive act and how the identity of a \u201cfunny woman\u201d can be both dangerous and liberating. As Margo Jefferson writes, \u201cGiven the history of social restriction and sexual regulation, how many women have been in a position to -- or been willing to -- take these risks?\u201d We will explore how the tools of comedy can be used to make mischief, to transgress the bounds of genre and form and to contest popular ideas about difference and power. How can humor be illuminating? How can humor be feminist? How can humor be intersectional? How can humor help us tell the hard truths? Can we laugh at oppression without laughing it off? This course does exclusively focus on humorists and welcomes writers of all genres who want to get playful. Rather than \u201cfunny,\u201d we focus on \u201cfun,\u201d explore playfulness as it occurs in myriad ways across a diverse variety of texts. As we do, we will find models, key writerly moves, to adapt into our own writing whatever shape or form it takes. As we shift to sharing our own thoughts and work, we will do so from a place of generosity. As Charna Halpern, Del Close and Kim \u201cHoward\u201d Johnson put it: \u201cA truly funny scene is not the result of someone trying to steal laughs at the expense of his partner, but of generosity \u2013 of trying to make the other person (and his ideas) look as good as possible.\u201d Let\u2019s share and discuss from this place of generosity. Rather than prescriptive critiques, let\u2019s ask one another \u201cwhat\u2019s the fun of this story?\u201d Let\u2019s urge each other to see how can that fun remain, adhere, and grow through our time together.",

    "course_descr":"This course is a general overview of the methods and approaches to the histories written on slavery and resistance. In it, we will consider the expansive reach of the Transatlantic slave trade to the Americas, its relationship to modern-day capitalism, and the contemporary debates on reparations. Students will learn to interpret and read various sources that contemplate the political and socioeconomic realities of slave societies. We will mainly examine the experiences of enslaved African-descended people through Black feminist approaches and methods. Therefore, the course will mainly focus on the location of women in these societies and the construction of gendered and racialized identities within these frameworks. In effect, this course explores how Black people, particularly Black women, have organized resistance strategies during slavery and through the re-narration of slave histories in academic and public spaces.\n  \nIn the second half of the course, students will consider the relationship between studies on slavery and the collective public memory of slavery in Europe, coastal Africa, the Caribbean, and North and South America. To better understand activism and the construction of memory, students will visit various \u201cmemory spaces\u201d in New York City, including the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the African Burial Ground, and the Flatbush Burial Ground. As this course demonstrates, the history of slavery is often written and narrated outside of official institutions and academic spaces. From this perspective, we will also engage with alternative methods (i.e., the body\/corporeal forms) to narrate the slave past in theater, public protest, and \u201crest as activism\u201d through outlets like the \u201cUnheard Voices\u201d theater workshop and yoga\/ meditative practices. Overall, the course will unpack issues of gender and race by studying slavery and its narration throughout the transatlantic world and how the descendants of enslaved people have \u201crewrote\u201d these histories in their intellectual work, art, and political activism",

From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong \u201cnut graph,\u201d to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into \u201cthe field\u201d (of New York City) to craft their own.

We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a \u201cmilieu\u201d of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism.
