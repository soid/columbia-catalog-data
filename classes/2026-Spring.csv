AFAS UN3004,Introduction to Black Geographies,"This course will introduce students to 
Black geographies
 as a spatial expression of Black studies. Black scholars have long recognized the complex spatialities of Black life, developing theories of diaspora, racial capitalism, and anti-/post-colonialism that are inherently geographical. In this course, we will think about space, place, landscape, and ecology through a Black geographic framework, paying attention to how scholars, activists, and artists engage the poetics and materiality of Black life to explore ideas about repair, inequality, resistance, and liberation. The questions that animate this course are: what are Black geographies? What is the future of Black geographies outside of academia? How can centering a “Black sense of place” in turn transform the way we think about space, place, and power? How does Black Studies account for and understand Black spatial condition, experience, and imaginaries?
  
The course will begin with an engagement of key works on Black geographies. We will come to see institutional Black geographies as concerned with the Black spatial imaginaries formed in the aftermath of enslavement and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. As such, our readings will center experiences in the United States. We will cover such topics as Black method(s), racial capitalism, regional geographies, carceral geographies, and Black home and infrastructure.
  
Ultimately, students will be introduced to central themes, concepts and approaches that highlight the spatialization of race and the racialization of space through various technologies that signify places according to new rules of inclusion and exclusion. In this way, we will examine historical and contemporary macro-community and micro- sub-community (e.g., neighborhood) issues shaping the social, economic and political lives of Black people.",Brandi Summers,2:10pm,4:00pm,10496,,W3004-20261-001,Introto Black  Geographie,African American and African Diaspora,AFAS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFAS/W3004-20261-001/,758 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],In-Person,,3,,W,20261AFAS3004W001,SEMINAR

AFEN BC3135,Zora Neale Hurston: A Writing Life,"On her “Record of Freshman Interest” form, Zora Neale Hurston, Barnard class of 1928, wrote in response to the question of what vocation or profession she had in mind after graduation, “I have had some small success as a writer and wish above all to succeed at it. Either teaching or social work would be interesting, but consolation prizes.”  No consolation prize was necessary as Hurston became one of American and African American literature’s finest writers, America’s first Black anthropologist, and a Black feminist ancestor and icon. A deep dive into Hurston’s work and writing life, this course reads Hurston as a narrative stylist and theorist in multiple genres: as poet, essayist, writer of short stories, novelist, playwright, folklorist, and memorist. The goal of this class is to read Hurston closely and widely and to identify and examine her aesthetic philosophy and stylistic choices as one of the first African American women able to have a writing “career.” We will concentrate on her work from the 1920s through the 1930s, when she was at Barnard, and a leading figure in the Harlem/New Negro Renaissance.
  
In her time, Hurston was adamant about writing for and about people like herself; she saw ordinary black people as keepers of a rich culture that should be celebrated and shared.  In this spirit, the assignments for this course will lead to final digital projects that can be shared with the Barnard community in anticipation of the centennial of Hurston’s matriculation and graduation from Barnard (1925-1928).  We will partner with the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard, as well as Barnard Archives; we will engage resources at Barnard, such as Hurston-focused issues of 
The Scholar and Feminist Online
, and other institutions, such as Columbia’s Rare Book Collection, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the Library of Congress.

Apollo’s role is American entertainment and global influence. Early Apollo performers paved the way for some of today’s most popular entertainers. We look at the impact of performers over several decades and the ways in which performers and performances at the Apollo influenced American entertainment through music, dance, comedy and more.

AHIS BC3864,"Signals: Networks, Publics, and Performa","This visual arts seminar explores the pirating, transformation, and circulation of media from the 1960s to the present. It examines the ways that media artists question public participation, democratic commitment, and collective memory. During the 1960s in the United States and abroad, the promise of networked communication prompted a consideration of global connectivity that brought artists and artworks outside of the gallery into the public sphere. Artist, often activists, explored the dissemination of information, and they commandeered messaging. Many of these artists positioned their output against mainstream media, while other artists seized existing media streams with the aim, optimistically, to alter them. Case studies include Stan VanDerBeek, Dara Birnbaum, Black Audio Collective, Tiffany Sia, Sondra Perry, and CAMP.  This course brings together seminar discussions, the practice of making, and the hosting of practitioners; it is designed to offer students an introduction to various aspects of media as it is crafted and curated within and without museum environments.",,,,00069,,X3864-20261-001,"Signals: Networks, Public",Art History @Barnard,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/X3864-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261AHIS3864X001,SEMINAR
AHIS BC3867,Photo as Material: A Studio Lab in Inter,"Contemporary practitioners of photography often treat photos as not just images to look at but materials to manipulate. They create objects that echo the basic elements of the medium—light and lens—and use altered or expired photo paper. They assemble physical albums, fictional archives, and sculptural installations. They play with the circulation of images online, or share virtual experiences of spaces via printed images.
  
In this course, we will look projects from recent decades that examine and expand the parameters of photography, including works by Liz Deschenes, David Horvitz, Zoe Leonard, Allison Rossiter, Stephanie Syjuco, and Wolfgang Tillmans. Via writing exercises, material experiments, and generative prompts, students will create their own research-informed projects that push photography beyond the screen or frame and into the material world.",,,,00070,,X3867-20261-001,Photo as Material: A Stud,Art History @Barnard,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/X3867-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261AHIS3867X001,STUDIO

Throughout its history, photography has been an especially powerful medium for addressing the most challenging issues facing Japanese society. Among the topics under discussion will be: tourist photography and the representation of women within that genre in the late 19th century, the politics of propaganda photography, the construction of Japanese cultural identity through the representation of “tradition” in photography, and the interest in marginalized urban subcultures in the photography of the 1960s and 1970s.

The course also focuses on how we, as scholars, citizens, and activists can work to alter these current conditions in ways that foster social and ecological justice for all living beings. Although we will ground our scholarship in anthropology, to encourage interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary thought, weekly readings will be drawn from across scholarly and activist canons.

ANTH BC3223,Gender Archaeolxgy,"This seminar critically reexamines the ancient world from the perspective of gender archaeology. Though the seedlings of gender archaeology were first sown by of feminist archaeologists during the 70’s and 80’s, this approach involves far more than simply ‘womanizing’ androcentric narratives of past. Rather, gender archaeology criticizes interpretations of the past that transplant contemporary social roles onto the archaeological past, casting the divisions and inequalities of today as both timeless and natural. This class challenges the idea of a singular past, instead championing a turn towards multiple, rich, messy, intersectional pasts.

ANTH GR6067,LANGUAGE AND ITS LIMITS,"This course examines 
language and its limits
 from the perspective of practice and theory, drawing on linguistic and sociocultural anthropology, semiotics, and deaf and disability studies. The first weeks focus on foundational texts and frameworks for language, semiotics, and communication, paying attention to the placement, and theorization, of boundaries that separate language from not-language and to the work such boundaries (are intended to) do. The second part of the course explores materials where the subjects and objects of study approach or even cross those boundaries, asking what kinds of ethical, intellectual, and relational demands these materials make in both social and analytic contexts. Focal topics may include linguistic relativity; semiotics; modality (signed, spoken, written languages); disability; trauma and colonialism; human-nonhuman communication; and gender.

ANTH GR6227,Ethnographies at the End of the World,"What can we learn from anthropological and ethnographic research in and about a damaged world, a world confronted by the violence and effects of war, climate change, transnational migration, post-industrial abandonment, and the lives and afterlives of colonialism and slavery? What are the ethnographic debates that address the catastrophes produced by capitalism and the lifeforms that emerge out of its ruins? What types of anthropological critique emerge in times enunciated as ‘the end of the world’? And what comes after this end? Ethnographies at the End of the World addresses these questions by paying close attention to some of the most relevant debates in contemporary anthropological theory and anthropological critique. These debates include, among others, discussions on violence and trauma, the politics of life and death, the work of memory and oblivion, and the material entanglements between human and non-human forms of existence. The aim of this seminar is to generate a discussion around the multiple implications of these theoretical arrangements and how anthropologists deploy them in their ethnographic understandings of the world we live in. In doing so, this course provides students with a fundamental understanding and conceptual knowledge about how anthropologists use and produce theory, and how this theoretical production is mobilized as a social critique. This course is reading intensive and operates in the form of a seminar. It is intended, primarily, for MA students in the department of anthropology and graduate students in other departments.",Nicholas Glastonbury,2:10pm,4:00pm,10501,,G6227-20261-001,Ethnographies at the End,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G6227-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,R,20261ANTH6227G001,SEMINAR
ANTH GR6365,EXHIBITION CULTURES,"Laurel Kendall. This course is a continuation of Museum Anthropology G6352 (not a prerequisite). Through the study of museum exhibitions, this course explores a series of debates about the representation of culture in museums, the politics of identity, and the significance of objects. We will consider the museum as a contemporary and variable form, as a site for the expression of national, group, and individual identity and as a site of performance and consumption. We will consider how exhibits are developed, what they aim to convey, what makes them effective (or not), and how they sometimes become flashpoints of controversy. Because the work of museums is visual, enacted through the display of material forms, we will also consider the transformation of objects into artifacts and as part of exhibitions, addressing questions of meaning, ownership, value, and magic. We will look at this range of issues from the point of view of practitioners, critics, and audiences. G6365 works in tandem with the exhibition project that will be developed in “Exhibition Practice in Global Culture” to produce a small exhibit at AMNH.",Laurel Kendall,2:10pm,4:00pm,10500,,G6365-20261-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G6365-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,"G6352

The course begins with a consideration of how archaeologists deal with the remains of the past in the present: What are archaeological sites and how do we ‘discover’ them? How do archaeologists ‘read’ or analyze sites and artifacts? From there, we will turn to the question of how archaeologists interpret these materials traces, in order to create narratives about life in the past.

ANTH UN3665,The Politics of Care,"Semester:
  
What are the consequences of entrenched inequalities in the context of care? How might we (re)imagine associated practices as political projects? Wherein lie the origins of utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? How might we track associated promises and failures as they travel across social hierarchies, nationalities, and geographies of care? And what do we mean when we speak of “care”? These questions define the scaffolding for this course. Our primary goals throughout this semester are threefold.  First, we begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. Second, we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, including urban and rural America, an Amazonia borderland, South Africa, France, and Mexico. Third, we will address temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced in the here-and-now, historically, and in a futuristic world of science fiction. Finally, and most importantly, we will remain alert to the relevance of domains of difference relevant to care, most notably race, gender, class, and species.

Summer:
  
What do we mean when we speak of “care”? How might we (re)imagine practices of care as political and moral projects? What promises, paradoxes, or failures surface amid entrenched inequalities? And what hopes, desires, and fears inform associated utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? These questions will serve as a scaffolding of sorts for this course, and our primary goals are fourfold. 
First,
 we will begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. 
Second,
 we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, communities, and geographies of care. 
Third
, we will remain alert to the temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced historically, in the here-and-now, and in the futuristic world of science fiction. 
Finally,

Silence, noise, voice, chambers, reverberation, sound in its myriad manifestations and transmissions.  From the captured souls of Edison’s phonography, to everyday acoustical adventures, the course turns away from the screen and dominant epistemologies of the visual for an extended moment, and does so in pursuit of sonorous objects.  How is it that sound so moves us as we move within its world, and who or what then might the listening subject be?",John Pemberton,2:10pm,4:00pm,10499,,V3880-20261-001,LISTENING: AN ETHNOG OF SOUND,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3880-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

Domains of inquiry include: spirit possession, trance states, séance, ritual performance, and related realms of cinematic projection, musical form, shadow theater, performative objects, and (other) things that move on their own, compellingly. Key theoretical concerns are subjectivity - particularly, the conjuring up and displacement of self in the form of the first-person singular I - and the haunting power of repetition.

ANTH UN3999,SENIOR THESIS SEM IN ANTHROPOL,"Prerequisites: The instructors permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages). The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis/ capstone project.

ARCH UN3117,MOD ARCHITECTURE IN THE WORLD,"Prerequisites: Designed for but not limited to sophomores; enrollment beyond 60 at the discretion of the instructor. 
  
Modern Architecture in the World is an introduction to different arenas in which architecture’s modern condition has been disputed in the last two centuries across different geographies. The course will address significant transformations in the built environment as well as the forms of practice, epistemic frameworks, and ideologies that led them. It will also attend to the forms of labor and economies that engendered new structures and organizations of space, the material resources and industries mobilized in their construction, the identities and forms of power they represented and imposed, the manifold embodiments that they hosted and shaped, the diverse socialites and politics they supported, and the ecologies they negotiated.
  
The course is organized around a number of key themes, with each class covering episodes spanning the whole period under consideration, up until the present. In this way, it will question the existence of a single line of development, a master narrative, or a teleological line of progress and will highlight instead the multiple, simultaneous, conflicting, and branching genealogies unfolding throughout the period. Students will gain knowledge of key buildings, artifacts, trends, and schools as they relate to those genealogies.
  
Each lecture will emphasize contending and shifting positions across geographies within the arenas explored, understanding hegemonic trends as well as dissenting positions. While different locations around the world will be highlighted in each class, the course positions modern architecture in the world by privileging an exploration of the cultural and material networks and hierarchies characteristic of the period—with attention to colonialism, coloniality, migration, resource extraction, and war, among others.",Anooradha I Siddiqi,4:10pm,5:25pm,00588,,W3117-20261-001,MOD ARCHITECTURE IN THE W,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W3117-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20261ARCH3117W001,LECTURE

ASRL BC3115,WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?,"This course is an introduction to the field of inquiry called The Problem of Evil, or Theodicy – that is, the investigation of God in the face of evil and suffering in the world.  How do we justify God? How do we reconcile disaster, pain, and suffering with an all-good, all-knowing, all-compassionate God?   This question arises in all religious traditions, but here we will study only four: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, each of which proposes its own array of answers. Our emphasis will be on primary texts from each tradition, with introductory and interpretive secondary sources brought in as supplementary.  These primary sources will be discussed in class, but especially in required section meetings.  A sub-theme of the course is the “pastoral” dimension of answers to the Problem of Evil: to what extent are the answers we study comforting?  This course has been created with the many crises presently afflicting our world – COVID-19, climate change, and the injustice of racism, to name a few – in mind.",Rachel McDermott,10:10am,11:25am,00405,,X3115-20261-001,WHY BAD THINGS GOOD PEOPL,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,ASRL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ASRL/X3115-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261ASRL3115X001,LECTURE

This course will provide a comprehensive foundation in programming methodology for quantitative biology applications that can be readily applied to any programming language. It is recommended for students interested in establishing or expanding their computational biology skillset. After completing this course, students should be able to:
  
1. Understand and explain the role of numerical and statistical methods in biology
  
2. Execute numerical computations using a widely-used programming language
  
3. Recognize common programming motifs that can be readily applied to other widely used languages
  
4. Design and troubleshoot algorithms to analyze diverse biological data and implement them using functions and scripts
  
5. Apply statistical programming techniques to model biological systems
  
6. Generate and interpret diverse plots based on biological datasets
  
 
  
Course overview: 
  
Once a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.",Vincent D Fitzpatrick,1:10pm,4:00pm,00487,,X2500-20261-001,R for Scientists,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/X2500-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,F,20261BIOL2500X001,LECTURE

We will ask questions like: what did practitioners and advocates hope to achieve by building the field of sustainable investment? What kinds of work, in what kinds of institutions, made up the field? What are the political and ideological contexts in which the field emerged, and how have they changed over time? Why did something seen as so marginal back become so much more central to how we talk about finance and financial policy now?

CEEN IA7730,"Climate Finance, Policy, and Just Transi","The field of responsible investment has grown rapidly over the last twenty years, with the climate crisis serving as the paradigmatic ESG issue for investors. In the private sector, investors pledge to decarbonize their portfolios, ask for carbon reporting to manage that task, join together to engage corporations on their transition plans. As activity has grown, questions about the effectiveness and limitations of climate finance approaches to the climate crisis have grown along with them. A narrow focus on decarbonization has begun to give way to broader considerations of the transition and the risks and opportunities it poses for affected workers and communities, on the belief that social cohesion is a precondition for successful transition. Private sector initiatives have been complemented with public policy and public investment efforts to shape environmental, social, and economic outcomes. Climate finance is in a moment of reflection, change, and doubt.
  
This course will survey and analyze the ways that public and private investment are being or could be directed in support of a Just Transition (i.e., a low-carbon transition that does not worsen social inequalities), and various ways to think about how effective climate finance can be. We will look at investors’ approaches to the decarbonization of the economy in political and social context, asking: how do or should investors integrate concerns for workers, communities, and environment into climate finance? what kinds of public policies are needed to ensure that investment points towards a Just Transition? The result, we hope, will lead both to a better understanding of the roles public and private investment in a Just Transition, climate policy, and an expanded critical capacity to analyze how well it’s working.",David C Wood,,,10276,,U7730-20261-001,"Clim Fin, Policy, & Just","Climate, Energy, & Environment",CEEN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CEEN/U7730-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261CEEN7730U001,LECTURE

Course readings will cover a variety of societies but return repeatedly to Egypt and Nubia as a touchstone. Over the course of the semester, we will explore how Nubians and Egyptians viewed one another as well as how both Egyptians and Nubians experienced and were experienced by immigrants, colonizers, and travelers. Throughout the ancient Mediterranean, as we’ll see, self-definitions and cultural boundaries shifted radically according to changing power dynamics both within groups and between them.
  
 
  
In seminar discussions, we’ll pose the following questions: How and when did groups who saw themselves as distinct from one another cooperate and intermarry? Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ.

This seminar traces that shift through the generative tradition, which treats language as an innate “mental organ” whose universal grammar lets children build a full syntax from sparse input. We follow Minimalism’s bold reduction: a single operation called Merge, plus a finite lexicon and two interfaces, one to articulation and one to thought, yields the “digital infinity” of human expression. Framing this architecture in evolutionary terms, we confront Darwin’s problem: did language emerge gradually for communication or erupt suddenly from pre-existing cognitive parts? Evidence from birdsong, primate calls, and gesture helps separate general performance limits from the species-specific competence that remains uniquely human.

In part one, perceptual decision-making, we will focus on computational models that can capture and explain decisions in perception, such as categorizing an orientation, or discriminating the direction of moving dots, or estimating the magnitude of a stimulus (e.g., time). We will start by laying the foundations of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference under uncertainty and build to models that incorporate confidence ratings and reaction times. In part two, value-based decision-making, we will move on to decisions that incorporate our values (e.g., ‘Should I go out or stay in and study?’, ‘Should I eat a burger or a salad?’). We will learn the basics of a computational modeling framework that captures how we learn values from rewards and punishments, reinforcement learning, as well as about model-free and model-based learning.

CPLT BC3510,ADVANCED WORKSHOP TRANSLA,"Maurice Blanchot once described translators as the “hidden masters of culture.” Indeed, though our labor and craft often go unrecognized in the age of Google Translate, translators play an essential role as tastemakers, bridge-builders, advocates, and diplomats, not to mention the most intimate readers and re-writers of literature. In this workshop, we will explore translation as a praxis of writing, reading, and revision. Together, we will also interrogate translation's complex and often fraught role in cultural production. What ethical questions does translation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated? What is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation teach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will include selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary translations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and memoir. Students will workshop original translations into English and complete brief writing and translation exercises throughout.",Faculty,,,00300,,X3510-20261-001,,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3510-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261CPLT3510X001,WORKSHOP
CPLT BC3552,The Arabic Novel,"The novel in Arabic literature has often been the place where every attempt to look within ends up involving the need to contend with or measure the self against the European, the dominant culture. This took various forms. From early moments of easy-going and confident cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to later author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines between west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern phenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation, for bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq—the man credited with being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great translator—called ‘disjunction’. We will begin with his satirical, deeply inventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a book with an insatiable appetite for definitions and comparisons, with Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an abiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges) and with locating and often subverting moments of connection and disconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present, where we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic, from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine. We will read them chronologically, starting with Leg Over Leg (1855) and finishing with Minor Detail, a novel that was only published last year.  Obviously, this does not claim to be a comprehensive survey; for that we would need several years and even then, we would fall short. Instead, the hope is that it will be a thrilling journey through some of the most facinating fiction ever written.

It is also used to unite the community in times of crisis. West African dance is not as much a strict  technique as it is a movement coming from the spirit and the rhythm of the drum and the energy of the  people. While there are certain steps that go with specific rhythms, it leaves space for the individual  interpretation and improvisations which is an important element. Dancing is more about the communication  between dancer and drummer. The movement of West African dance tends to be energetic and big. It is very  expressive, and the energy is outward. 
  
Some African dance steps are taken directly from daily activities such as planting or hunting. Most, however,  are an expression of joy or release of the spirit. Dancing is done by communicating with a drummer to create  positive energy. It is a way to enjoy oneself and each other.

DSPC IA7500,Quantitative Methods in Program Evaluati,"Pre-req: SIPA IA6501 - Quant II. 
The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of how to perform some more advanced statistical methods useful in answering policy questions using observational or experimental data. It will also allow them to more critically review research published that claims to answer causal policy questions. The primary focus is on the challenge of answering causal questions that take the form “Did A cause B?” using data that do not conform to a perfectly controlled randomized study. Examples from real policy studies and quantitative program evaluations will be used throughout the course to illustrate key ideas and methods.
  
First, we will explore how best to design a study to answer causal questions given the logistical and ethical constraints that exist. We will consider both experimental and quasi-experimental (observational studies) research designs, and then discuss several approaches to drawing causal inferences from observational studies including propensity score matching, interrupted time series designs, instrumental variables, difference in differences, fixed effects models, and regression discontinuity designs.
  
As this course will focus on quantitative methods, a strong understanding of multivariate regression analysis is a prerequisite for the material covered. Students must have taken two semesters of statistics (IA6500 & IA6501 or the equivalent) and have a good working knowledge of STATA.",Alan S Yang,,,10287,,U7500-20261-001,Quant Methods-Program Eva,Data Science for Policy,DSPC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DSPC/U7500-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,"IA6500

(Note: macroeconomic topics and forecasting methods are not covered.)
  
The central objective is to train students to be effective analysts and policy researchers. Key questions include: Given the available data, what analysis best informs the policy question? How should we design research, prepare data, and implement statistical methods using R? How can we assess causal effects of policies rather than mere correlations? What ethical considerations arise when working with data on marginalized populations?
  
Students will learn through hands-on analysis of datasets tied to a range of policy issues, including: caste-based expenditure gaps in India, racial disparities in NYPD fare evasion enforcement, water shutoffs in Detroit, Village Fund grants in Indonesia, public health insurance and child mortality, and Stand Your Ground laws and gun violence.

DVGO IA7580,Managing Humanitarian Emergencies,"According to the 2025 Global Humanitarian Overview, humanitarian partners are appealing for over US$47 billion to assist nearly 190 million people facing life-threatening and urgent needs across 72 countries. These staggering numbers are fueled by drivers such as conflicts and political instability, climate change, disease outbreaks, poverty, and natural hazards. Together, these drivers have deepened pre-existing vulnerabilities, resulting in unprecedented need. They have also prompted humanitarians to address the accountability challenges and inequities deeply seated within the aid system.
  
Humanitarian agencies strive to meet rising needs, but the task that confronts them is immense. 
Funding
 for humanitarian responses is not keeping pace with requirements: although donors contribute more, the amounts are not commensurate with needs. Beyond financing, donor policies and politics challenge agencies' ability to deliver. The safety and security of aid workers is increasingly under threat.
  
This course focuses on the management of humanitarian operations and intends to provide students with the opportunity to explore critical issues in the humanitarian system. It helps students understand debates in the humanitarian system, develop a framework of analysis they can use in headquarters and the field, and acquire a toolkit to help them succeed as aid workers.

DVGO IA7845,"Gender, Politics, and Development","Gender equality, and the empowerment of women and girls, are now widely accepted as development goals in their own right and as essential to inclusive and sustainable development. Yet despite progress in many areas, gender gaps and discrimination persist. This course asks: How did gender equality move from the periphery to the center of development discourse, and what difference has this shift made? Is gender equality a human right, an essential dimension of human development, or “smart economics”? What are the implications of a gender equality agenda for men and boys, and for broader understandings of gender identities and sexualities? What policies, strategies, and practices have been effective—or ineffective—in narrowing gender gaps and improving outcomes for both women and men in different development settings? What are possible responses to the “gender backlash” emerging in some countries and institutions?
  
In this course, we approach gender, politics, and development through theory, policy, and practice. We explore multiple constructions of gender in development discourse; the intersection of gender with race, ethnicity, caste, class, sexual orientation, disability, and other social categories; and the influence of dominant economic and political trends. We examine how gender norms shape the approaches of governments, development agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.
  
A critical gender lens is applied to a wide range of development sectors and issues, including economic development, political participation, education and health, environment and climate change, and conflict and displacement. The course also considers current debates and approaches related to gender mainstreaming and gender metrics in development practice.

EDUC BC3032,EDUC POLICY: NYC & CLIMATE/COVID CRISIS,"This course is designed to provide students with a deeper understanding of the processes, players, and purposes of educational policy.  It asks us to consider and reconsider the ways that we generally conceptualize educational policy from idea to implementation. Rather than taking a content-specific approach where we might study different forms of educational policy, such as language policy, school choice, and special education, I have designed the course to think collectively and deeply about the long-arc of injustice, inequity, possibility, and resistance from historical redlining to the climate/covid crisis as well as the actors who create, revise, and sustain educational policy in formal and informal educational spaces. As we do this, we will be asking you to think about a particular content area and how we might reimagine the policies in this area as we face the multipronged crisis of a planet that is burning amidst a global pandemic. While much of the reading is centered in the United States, we encourage you to think broadly about the global impact that educational policy has on the lives of educators, families, and youth and how these policies have the power to both replicate and dismantle inequities in our world.
  
 
  
Learning Objectives
  
  
Students will understand how to critique and use both qualitative and quantitative methods in policy research and policy writing.
  
Students will be able to assess the strengths and limitations of different media sources, policy reports, academic scholarship, journalism articles, opinion pieces, documentary films, etc. and think critically about the media that they want to employ in their final project.
  
Students will generate a policy brief that outlines a policy problem and generates a research-based solution.",Maria S Rivera Maulucci,,,00506,,X3032-20261-001,ED POLICY:NYC & CLIMATE/C,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3032-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261EDUC3032X001,SEMINAR
EDUC BC3042,"GENDER, SEXUALITY, AND SCHOOL","Broadly, this course explores the relationship between gender, sexuality, and schooling across national contexts. We begin by considering theoretical perspectives, exploring the ways in which gender and sexuality have been studied and understood in the interdisciplinary field of education. Next, we consider the ways in which the subjective experience of gender and sexuality in schools is often overlooked or inadequately theorized. Exploring the ways that race, class, citizenship, religion and other categories of identity intersect with gender and sexuality, we give primacy to the contention that subjectivity is historically complex, and does not adhere to the analytically distinct identity categories we might try to impose on it.",Ileana Jimenez,,,00388,,X3042-20261-001,GENDER SEXUALITY AND SCHOOL,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3042-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261EDUC3042X001,SEMINAR

Throughout the semester, we will work to “complicate class”, reconsidering what class is, why class matters, and how we can best think about the relationship between social class and schooling. You will develop a language for talking about class, considering the affordances and constraints of various conceptions of class. You will also leave with critical questions about the possibilities and limitations of relying on schools as a solution to social problems. Recognizing restraints, we will conclude by reflecting on how we might work toward creating more equitable learning environments for poor and working-class students.",Rachel Throop,12:10pm,2:00pm,00389,,X3045-20261-001,EDUCATION & LIMITS EQUITY,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3045-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261EDUC3045X001,SEMINAR

EDUC BC3068,"Education, Crisis and Futures","Education is a social project of making futures. It is a field where people imagine selves and worlds to come
 while navigating current constraints and past legacies. Even in the face of various crises that disrupt
 educational systems globally, education is often understood as a crisis response and charged with the task of
 forging alternative futures and driving social and economic progress.
 In this course, we will interrogate the politics of crisis and futurity in education. First, we will explore how
 notions of crisis are mobilized to define problems and solutions in education research and policy. In this
 exploration, we will ask how histories and politics of domination along lines of race, class, gender, and other
 social categories are articulated or silenced in discourses of educational crisis. We will attend to how crises
 create both danger and opportunity by considering how they serve to justify violent, dispossessive restructuring
 and how they lay bare structures of inequality in ways that generate collective action and transformation.
 Next, we will Interrogate education’s futural orientations. We will probe familiar progress narratives and explore
 what roles education plays in shaping how marginalized communities imagine and enact futures beyond the
 status quo, attending to both its affordances and limitations. Throughout the course, we will draw on
 speculative fiction and on scholarship in anthropology, Black studies, and comparative education to investigate
 the politics of crisis and futurity in diverse educational contexts. We will engage study as speculative practice
 through collaborative and independent exercises that invite us to develop praxes for just futures of education.",Amelia S Herbert,,,00395,,X3068-20261-001,"Education, Crisis and Fut",Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3068-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261EDUC3068X001,SEMINAR

For the duration of this course, we will attempt to begin the work of extrapolating the function of Blackness within these various genres—interrogating which syntactical elements are required to label a piece of fiction “Black” and how Blackness informs genre. Through formal analysis of texts and the application of various theories presented in class, we’ll begin to understand how Blackness moves through genre to understand its relationship to the world and in some cases, to the artform itself. We will look at various texts: Film, Television, Prose, and Music. By looking across genres, we will be able to honor the inherent intertextuality of Black work and the constant inter-discursive work done across genre, text, and time. Whether a critique of structural anti-Blackness writ large, an expression of the complexity of the positionality of Black persons, or a statement of the function of Blackness, these texts make a case for the theoretical rigor and provocative discourses that lies at the heart of Black Speculative Fiction.",Danielle T Douge,,,00077,,X3001-20261-001,,Film @Barnard,ENFL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENFL/X3001-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261ENFL3001X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC1045,Ghost Stories,"What are ghosts? Why are we haunted by them? And why are we so drawn to telling stories about these hauntings? In this class, we will read ghost stories from the 17th century through the present day; in the process, we will examine what these stories reveal about our own preoccupations, fears, and desires. Writers and readers turn to ghost stories for horror and suspense, for sure, but also because they’re a powerful medium for reckoning with history and memory—with the past’s hold over the present—particularly when it comes to violence, loss, oppression, and trauma. Ghost stories engage with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; with social otherness; with marginalization. Ghost stories stage problems of justice, vengeance, and guilt. Ghost stories trouble the nature of the body, and the meaning of (and boundaries between) life and death. Ghost stories lend themselves both to fear and to laughter, both to questions and to answers. While exploring all of these topics and themes, we will also consider the trope of storytelling itself, which figures prominently in so many works of the genre. What is wrapped up in the gesture of telling a story, and in the ways, contexts, and reasons in and for which these stories get told?

Increasing numbers of AI experts and researchers emphasize the urgent need for college students to develop AI literacy, preparing them for evolving job markets, fostering ethical awareness, and ensuring equitable participation in an AI-driven society. To help them achieve AI literacy, this introductory-level course teaches students how to ethically and effectively use Generative AI (GAI) by exploring how GAI works, how to use it properly, and how to critically evaluate its output. Students will understand AI model functionality, distinguish GAI from traditional AI, examine issues of originality, authorship, intellectual property, copyright, plagiarism, fair use, accuracy, bias, environmental impacts, and privacy - all while developing meta-awareness about how AI simulates certain aspects of human creativity and cognition The course's placement in Barnard's English Department reflects the recognition that AI's development requires interdisciplinary perspectives beyond STEM, as AI research increasingly intersects with humanities and social sciences to address ethical, social, and cultural implications. Through ethics-focused assignments and writing projects culminating in a final research investigation in students' chosen fields, this course empowers students to resist pure AI reliance and actively control these technologies rather than remaining passive observers of AI's expanding influence in academia and society.",Benjamin M Breyer,,,00613,,X1249-20261-001,AI LITERACY IN PRACTICE,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1249-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261ENGL1249X001,LECTURE

We will examine four key craft areas: voice, characterization, imagery, and arrangement, both in contemporary published writing and in the writing of the people in this class. In small and large group workshops, we will consider each writer’s work with care and attention to the writer’s vision. By discussing each work-in-progress on its own terms, we will help our fellow writers deepen the meaning and impact of their work. Through risk-taking, and building a creative community, we will also grow and deepen our personal relationships to craft.

  “In the beginner’s mind, possibilities are many, in the expert’s mind, there are few.” — Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind
  
In this introductory poetry writing workshop, we will cultivate an ardently playful approach to writing, one committed to honoring “beginner’s mind.” Embarrassment, error and amateurism will be embraced as values and fertile grounds (rather than obstructions) for writing.
  
Together we will explore poetry writing as the pursuit and  expression of a liberatory language–the language of our highest attention and freedom– shared  between reader and writer.
  
In addition to workshops, we will alternate between classes centered on formal and thematic  studies with others focussed on contemplative practices and the writing process. Formal and revisionary explorations will be guided by the experiments of Bernadette Mayer, Inger Christensen, Dadaists and the Oulipo; by generative varieties of translation as practiced by Mónica de la Torre and Sawako Nagasaku–homophonic and self-translation; the role of inside jokes and an innocent attention to our environment, inspired by Gertrude Stein and Wadih Saadeh.
  
Drawing on teachings by Corita Kent, art exercises by Kim Beom and Zen Buddhist rituals we will learn contemplative practices that help us create, combine and  consider our attention in order to see how receptive, open, beginner’s mind effort, rather than forced determination toward a particular outcome, underpins our deepest work in writing.",Angel Nafis,,,00160,,X3110-20261-001,INTRODUCTION TO POETRY WR,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3110-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261ENGL3110X001,WORKSHOP

Flash Fiction Workshop. 
This course is an intensive writing workshop focused on the art of flash fiction—stories told in under 1,500 words. The workshop will emphasize experimentation, encouraging students to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling by playing with form, language, and perspective. Readings will include works originally written in English as well as those in translation, offering a broad view of global approaches to flash fiction. Discussions will cover the mechanics of storytelling on a compressed scale, including structure, character development, point of view, dialogue, and style. Authors will include Cheever, Couto, Hempel, Davis, and Wang, and through these readings, students will explore the structural possibilities of the short form, the role of voice, and the ways in which brevity can intensify narrative impact. The class will examine how compression, omission, and implication create resonance in fiction.Each student will write and workshop three original short pieces, receiving detailed feedback from peers and the instructor. The goal is to develop a keen sense of how the economy of language can create depth and complexity in fiction.

We’ll talk about myriad ways to subvert the expected meaning of the wolf and the wicked in our own time, and what new subtexts may be lurking in the shared stories we reconsider at different points in our lives. “You shift time and location to see what holds true, and why or why not,” novelist Helen Oyeyemi says of the allure of fairy tales as a place of departure for a new work of fiction.

In this section of creative nonfiction, we will explore the essay. We will consider the essay in the original and most open-ended sense of the term—coming from French, essai, meaning “attempt."" This type of essay is also known as a personal essay.  
  
The personal essay is a paradoxical form. It makes rules and then breaks them. It announces itself and then slips out the backdoor. It is a mischief-maker and the successful essayist remembers that, remembers to stay playful.  And that's what our workshop will be about. As we attempt to write and share our stories, let’s ask one another: “what’s the fun of this story?” Let’s urge each other to see how can that fun remain, adhere, and grow through the drafting process.
  
 Most of all, let's use the essay to explore our relationship to writing overall. Phillip Lopate writes that the essay “sets up a relationship with the reader, a dialogue—a friendship.” Seeing the sentence as a set of relationships, one tied to our human relations, we will write and revise with the hope of fostering an enduring relationship with the page.
  
Writers should expect to workshop at least twice, working toward a final portfolio of 15-20 double-spaced pages.

ENGL BC3161,MEDIEVAL LOVE LITERATURE,"Love dominates, according to received opinion, the literature of the Middle Ages, a period that indeed saw the emergence of courtly romance and Troubadour poetry. But medieval love literature is not all brave knights pining for haughty ladies. Love, for medieval writers, could be sacred or transgressive, irrational or philosophical, transcendent or debasing – and often it was several of these things at once. On the other hand, in a time when everything claims to be about love, one may sometimes be tempted to wonder if nothing is, and the topic certainly provided a space for medieval writers to explore a number of related themes such as gender, class, cultural difference, nature, and truth. In this course we will consider a selection of these rich and paradoxical texts, as we read in a variety of

So we might find some affinity with our own current situation, facing new challenges, our world turned upside down, which is what many people felt during that time. Out of all of this turmoil, however, came great literature including lyric poems by John Donne and others exploring love and desire, doubt and faith, sex and God. Donne also wrote a series of 
Devotions
 grappling with mortality over a course of 23 days when he was suffering from typhus or relapsing fever and almost died. Others turned to find solace in the natural world and friendship (Amelia Lanyer, Katherine Philips, Henry Vaughan). Robert Burton wrote a book on melancholy, which he kept adding to.  Francis Bacon thought a revolution in science could redeem the world. Thomas Browne, a physician as well as writer, tackled the problem of intolerance and religious conflict. Thomas Hobbes thought only a firm (authoritarian?) government could reestablish peace and security, while Gerard Winstanley (a “Leveller”) thought that owning land (and money) was the source of all war and misery. Transgressive women had their own ideas. The Quaker leader Margaret Fell defended women's right to preach.

ENGL BC3215,VICTORIAN SCIENCE&SCIFI,"Although Victorian fiction is best known today for its realist commitment to representing the world “as it really is,” especially in genres such as the courtship novel and the Bildungsroman, Victorian novelists also wrote during an age of enthusiastic scientific inquiry that questioned and revised the very fabric of the reality that realist genres purported to represent. This course will accordingly explore the more adventurous and speculative fiction of the Victorian period that was most closely attuned to these new ways of representing and thinking about reality. How did new scientific developments such as evolutionary theory in biology, and the atomic theory in physics, reshape how writers viewed the relationships between human and animal, self and other, space and time, body and mind? How did departing from traditional realist modes enable Victorian science fiction writers to explore the ethical, social, and political implications of scientific theories in ways that scientific prose may not have envisioned? In this course we will read major works of Victorian fiction, by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others, alongside selections of scientific prose in such fields of Victorian science as biology, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and psychology. Throughout the course, we will understand “science” to include both major developments in the history of science, such as the emergence of evolutionary thought, as well as more eccentric Victorian areas of inquiry, such as phrenology, mesmerism, telepathy, and degeneration. The first three units into which the course is divided each explore a major field of Victorian science alongside a major conceptual category that it challenged and altered: biology and the nature of the human; psychology and the constitution of the self; the physical sciences and the nature of space and time. In each unit, we will investigate how writers’ engagements with these conceptual questions led them to experiment with literary categories such as character, narration, and plot. The course will close with a unit on texts that more broadly address Victorian conceptions of progress, technology, and development. In addition to these specific thematic and formal questions, we will think broadly about how the Victorians understood the value of science and technology in relation to the arts and to literature, and ask what their answers to these questions can offer us as we navigate similar questions today.

ENGL BC3281,ILLEGAL IS NOT A NOUN: DISRUPTING NARRAT,"This course engages with narratives about detention and deportation in the modern United States, with special attention to the stories of Latinx people. We will analyze how journalistic writing, documentaries, and personal narratives shape public policy and American attitudes about the ""the immigrant experience."" What are these narratives, how are they told, and what are their implications? How do writers disrupt these narratives? We will develop four scholarly essays over the course of the semester to investigate these questions.",Maria D Hinojosa,,,00095,,X3281-20261-001,ILLEGAL IS NOT A NOUN,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3281-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261ENGL3281X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3321,"Changing Climate, Changing World","An interdisciplinary course focused on environmental humanities and based in the English department, “Changing Climate, Changing World” will examine the representation of nature across time and its implications for global warming and biodiversity from multiple perspectives, emphasizing issues of climate change and environmental justice. The course will provide a conceptual framework for reading and critiquing the representation of nature in the context of historical, economic, social, cultural, scientific and political change.
  
 The course design asks students to address climate change in the context of the industrial revolution before discussing environmental issues in a pre-industrial and finally a post-industrial context. We will begin in media res by addressing issues of industrialization and colonialism in the mid-18th and 19th century before considering indigenous, medieval, and renaissance representations of nature. In the second half of the course, we return to examine contemporary issues from the early 20th century to the present.
  
 The course will meet twice weekly in Spring 2025. One of these meetings will include a lecture with a guest faculty member from Barnard and Columbia, or occasionally with other experts, artists, and activists from New York and beyond, followed by questions from the audience on the lecture. The second meeting will emphasize student discussion of the lecture and associated readings, with the purpose of integrating each lecture into the total course framework. Since all the participating faculty are teaching full time, we will aim to schedule lectures in the late afternoon or evening to minimize conflicts. We would also like to open some of the lectures to the public, either virtually or in person, so that their impact could be felt beyond the class itself.",Linn C Mehta,,,00619,,X3321-20261-001,Changing Climate and Worl,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3321-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261ENGL3321X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3413,SERIAL HORROR,"Cannibals! Orphans! Strikes! Vampires! This course asks how do horror stories
 
employ suspense and disgust to unsettle political, social, and ethical complacency in the hearts and minds of readers and audiences? We will consider the pan-media global adaptations, translations, reiterations, and afterlives of several powerful horror stories—maritime, domestic, industrial, and supernatural-- as they serially repeat across national borders, languages, historical periods, and delivery platforms, from novels, plays, and film to an underwater sculpture, photographs, paintings, advertisements, a graphic novel, and other aesthetic forms. We will read each adaptation in synchronic dialogue with its companions, in diachronic perspective, and through relevant theoretical lenses, comparing the priorities of aesthetic form in the context of the national, cultural, and the historical contingencies of class and race difference. Texts may include the 
Raft of the Medusa, Jane Eyre, Mary Barton, Germinal, Dracula
 and the 
Dybbuk.

ENGL BC3418,DESIRE AND METAMORPHOSIS,"Change is fundamental to our experience as human beings, and the experience of change lies at the heart of most great stories. Sometimes this is a transition that the heroine has desired; other times, alteration and transformation arise from sources mysterious and unknown, or as a result of the journey the story has brought them. This course examines the element of change in a wide range of literature, from Ovid to Maggie Nelson, from Shakespeare to Roxane Gay—but it also provides an opportunity for students to consider the ways in which they, too have been changed—by joy, by trauma, by time. In addition to writing critically about the works we will read together, students will also write a personal essay about their experience of metamorphosis; this essay will be examined in a modified workshop format. At semester’s end, students will re-write and change that same essay, in hopes of seeing how revision on the page might provide a model for understanding the metamorphoses we experience as human beings on this earth. Authors will likely include Ovid, Kafka, Robert Louis Stevenson, Borges, Shaun Tan, Roxane Gay, George Saunders, Arthur C. Clarke, Shakespeare, and Maggie Nelson.

ENGL BC3644,DEPRESSION,"Depression has existed for all time.  But our explanations of it has shifted, from sin, to an imbalance of the humours, and a poetic inspiration; from the eighteenth-century mechanistic understanding of the self, to the Freudian family romance that generates trauma, and to our current neuro-genetic understanding of the mind as a machine that can achieve happiness with pharmaceutical intervention.    We will follow these permutations, even as we read novels, poems, plays, and view film (and art) for their diagnostic awareness of mental suffering.   And we will also ask the question: what if depression comes not from within but without, the intelligent response of aware minds to a world that has become undone.",Daphne Miriam Merkin,,,00094,,X3644-20261-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3644-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261ENGL3644X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3992,SENIOR PROJECT IN CREATIVE WRITING,"Enrollment limited to Barnard senior English majors with a concentration in creative writing.
  
This creative writing workshop represents an opportunity for creative writing concentrators to focus on one large project that will serve as a capstone senior project. As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project—such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement.

http://coms4170.cs.columbia.edu/2024-spring/
  
**Attendance required**
 This class is highly interactive, and attendance for many of the lectures is mandatory. Especially in the second half of the class, students must attend in-class project mentoring sessions to get feedback from their TA and fellow students.
  
 
**Technical Preparation**
 The first half of the class is quite technical, we introduce principles of usable design and integrate them in to technical assignments. There is a lot of programming in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python (server-side). Whereas we do teach these technologies, we constantly find that students who have seen them before have a better time in class. Former students have advised future students to do an online web programming series like CodeAcademy (which is sadly no longer free). Advanced Programming is an advised pre- requisite, but the true pre-requisite is simply coding experience. You will be expected to figure out some of the programming aspects by yourself, and you need the maturity to do that. Hint: ask GPT. If you are going to email me about this class, please use a subject line

ENRE BC3145,Jews in Christian Narrative,"Since the beginning of the movement that would become Christianity, Jews have occupied a unique – and uniquely fraught – position in the Christian imagination. Why did so few of the very Jews to whom Jesus preached accept him as their messiah? Why, as the Church grew in wealth and influence, did Jews continue to live in Christian communities, and what was their proper place in Christian society? In our course, we will read early and medieval Christian narratives about Jews that are, in many ways, an attempt to answer these questions – dark imaginative visions of Jews as child-killers, cannibals, and devil worshippers. We will use narrative, psychological, and literary theory as tools to analyze these tales and to make sense of their complicated and continuing legacy.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,,,00169,,X3145-20261-001,Jews in Christian Narrati,English @Barnard,ENRE,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENRE/X3145-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261ENRE3145X001,SEMINAR

ENVP IA6239,Politics & Policy of Urban Sustainabilit,"This is a course for thoughtful people who wish to influence actual policy outcomes related to sustainability challenges in major cities. Its objective is not to provide a primer on urban sustainability solutions; this is readily available from textbooks and will change by the time you are in a position to act. Rather, the course’s objective is to prepare you for the kind of challenges that will face you as a policy practitioner in the field of urban sustainability. Cities are increasingly recognized as a key level of government for environmental and sustainability policy. As at all levels, politics and policy are intensely intertwined, and perhaps more so at the local level because the decisions involved often affect constituents directly and intimately --in their neighborhoods, in their homes, in their commutes. This reading-heavy colloquium explores the politics and the policy of urban sustainability from the perspective of someone who wishes to effect change. It culminates in a team project in which students act as a sustainability policy team in a mayoral (or equivalent) office in one of the world’s major cities. The course considers key components of the city itself, with the objective of understanding what shapes the city and its impact on the environment. It mainly uses case studies from the twentieth-century United States, paired with international readings to allow a comparison with other experiences. The focus on deep case studies allows the consideration of the situations, constraints, and political dynamics of specific situations. It is intended to provide students with the ability to recognize patterns in urban political and policy dynamics related to sustainability. These are paired with an overview of leading solutions and how the professor believes practitioners should evaluate them for their own cities. The course also prominently features in-class presentations and discussions of the students’ main project: a team-based memo making a specific recommendation to solve a problem in a specific major world city, which is presented twice, once for a diagnosis of the problem in a given city and a second time with a policy recommendation. This project is the major portion of the overall grade for the class, and is used to allow the students to wrestle with the challenge of turning ideas from past and present into successful urban sustainability policies that can get implemented in a political and institutional world. In order to cover issues in depth, this course is not exhaustive;",Rohit T Aggarwala,,,10351,,U6239-20261-001,Politics & Policy-Urban S,MPA-ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE POL,ENVP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENVP/U6239-20261-001/,,In-Person,"Architecture

Some time is also devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn microeconomic concepts, but also how to explain them to decision-makers.

Corequisites: (Since this is a Film course, it does not count as a writing course for English majors with a Writing Concentration.)
  
This course is ideal for writers of their FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD screenplays. The first several weeks will focus on STORY: What it is, what it isn’t, how to recognize the difference. How to find your own individual stories that nobody else in the universe can tell.
  
From there we will make the transition to the highly individualized techniques, the strengths and limitations, the dynamics of telling a SCREEN STORY; what to leave in, what to leave out. As Michelangelo puts it—starting with a block of marble and chipping away everything that isn’t David.  Through studies of existing screenplays and films in coordination with and hands-on writing exercises which we will share in class, we will develop our skills in all aspects of screenwriting; building fascinating characters, dialogue, story construction (The BIG PICTURE) and scene construction (The Small Picture)

FILM BC3260,WRITING FOR TELEVISION: SHORT FORM,"Prerequisite: FILM BC3201 or equivalent. Please note that since this is a Film Studies course, it does not count as a creative writing course for English majors with a creative writing concentration. This course will focus on the primary pillar of television production: the teleplay. Through a number of creative exercises, students will learn the intricacies of the unique screenwriting formats that are the half-hour and hour-long teleplays. Together we will cover the differences between an episode arc and a seasonal one, the requirements of A/B/C story plotting, and how to write an effective show bible. We will survey the existing pantheon of great television writing in order to help students narrow in on their individual sensibilities. By the end of the course, students will have a written original pilot and a mini series bible.",Faculty,,,00086,,X3260-20261-001,WRITING FOR TELEVISION,Film @Barnard,FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/X3260-20261-001/,,,,3,BC3201,,20261FILM3260X001,WORKSHOP
FILM BC3278,DIGITAL PRODUCTION,"Prerequisites: 
both 
FILM BC3201 (or equivalent) 
and 
FILM BC3200 (or equivalent). Digital Production offers visual storytellers an incredible medium to connect and build an audience. It is an inexpensive, accessible platform to launch micro-budget concepts. Developing the storytellers voice  inexpensively is critical to the evolution of any student, no matter their starting point. The Digital Series course is intended to take students from story ideation through creation of an independent digital series. Emanating from a writers room setting, all steps of the process will be explored and supported by in-class discussion, examples and workshops. This hands-on class revolves around the TV series production model: breaking story, writing pages, preproduction planning, filming and post-production review. We will emphasize the writers voice, construction of series storytelling, and establishing realistic scopes of production.",Danielle T Douge,,,00635,,X3278-20261-001,,Film @Barnard,FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/X3278-20261-001/,,,,3,"BC3201

FILM BC3331,QUEER VISIONS IN CONTEMPORARY FILM,"In this class, we will focus on recurring themes and questions of contemporary queer cinema by engaging with a number of film genres and forms, and explore how filmmakers create queer visions of the world through their cinematic practices. We will also consider how these queer films are informed by various local, national, cultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers create queer narratives that contest, complicate or reify dominant narratives of gender and sexuality? How do they play around with cinematic and genre conventions?
  
Films, directors and genres studied are subject to change but will likely include directors such as Celine Sciamma, Cheryl Dunye, Pedro Almodovar, Todd Haynes, among others; and various genres such as drama, romance, thriller, mockumentary, thriller and experimental film.",Faculty,,,00075,,X3331-20261-001,QUEER VISIONS IN CONT FIL,Film @Barnard,FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/X3331-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261FILM3331X001,LECTURE
FILM BC3702,MAJOR WOMEN FILMMAKERS,"Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood’s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as “marginal” or “peripheral” cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet… are these motion pictures really “secondary”? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called “alternative women’s cinema” at the core of film history. Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women’s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agnès Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, Věra Chytilová, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertmüller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler. Among the films screened in the classroom are silent movies –
Suspense
 (Lois Weber, 1913),
 The Seashell and the Clergyman 
(Germaine Dulac, 1928)—, early independent and experimental cinema –
Girls in Uniform 
(Leontine Sagan, 1931), 
Ritual in Transfigured Time 
(Maya Deren, 1946)—, “new wave” films of the 1950s and 1960s –
Cléo from 5 to 7
 (Varda, 1962), 
Daisies 
(Chytilová, 1966)–,

 cinema of the 1970s –

GREK GR8015,TIME AND TEMPO IN HOMER AND SAPPHO,"This seminar sets Homer's Iliad and Sappho's lyric poems in relation to each other around topics involving time – including narrative time, beginnings and endings, timeliness, and temporality, as well as rhythm and tempo, syncopation, bodily timing and performance, and chronotopic dynamics. It proposes to think as well about textual time, meaning both how different genres orchestrate time and tempo but also how these authors are treated in ancient and modern reception. We will read theoretical studies of time and temporality, the event, and periodicity, as well as those more focused on genre and occasional performance. Discussions will center around close attendance on specific images and dynamics in the ancient texts, as well as the ways in which theoretical frames may illuminate these. Thus, for instance, seminars juxtapose the epic punctuation of bodies in space with Sappho's female lovers on the move, with scholarly readings deployed to critique the epic-lyric divide around these dynamics. A central and recurrent figure in this scheme is Helen, who is presented in Homeric epic as the central catalyst for the violent unfolding of events (i.e., the Trojan War) and who functions in lyric poetry as a cathexis for the violent consequences of desire.",,,,00193,,G8015-20261-001,TIME & TEMPO HOMER AND SA,Classics @Barnard,GREK,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/GREK/G8015-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261GREK8015G001,SEMINAR

HIST BC2985,History of Global Economic Inequality,"Economic inequality characterizes virtually every human society, informing deep social dynamics. And yet scholars and lay people alike hold vastly differing opinions about the effects that inequality has on the social fabric, and the need to combat it. The question of how wealth and income are distributed among the members of a national community as well as among nations has acquired center stage in analyses about fundamental issues such as the causes of the progress and decline of societies and the dynamics of globalization. Inequality issues are at the heart of discussions about international economic relations, transnational phenomena such as migrations and the domestic economic platforms of political parties.
  
This course will provide students with the critical instruments with which to analyze the main interpretations of economic inequality from the eighteenth century to the present. We will read and discuss authors who have addressed the question of inequality and distribution: how did they frame the issue? What visions of society emerged from their analyses? We will see how the concept of inequality has changed historically, how different dimensions (e.g., national and international) have appeared and disappeared, and how visions of national, international and global inequality inform debates about the foundational elements of the social compact.",Michele Alacevich,,,00323,,X2985-20261-001,Hist of Global Econ Inequ,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2985-20261-001/,,,"Barnard College

HRTS UN3934,Seeking Sanctuary in New York City,"In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum – the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that of a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city’s long history of refuge? 
  
This course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection.
  
This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.",Jennifer Trowbridge,,,00380,,V3934-20261-001,Seeking Sanctuary in New,Human Rights (HRTB),HRTS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/V3934-20261-001/,,,,5,,,20261HRTS3934V001,SEMINAR

The course is therefore fundamentally designed around the lives, experiences, and needs of real people in New York City and the organizations dedicated to advancing their demands. Our partner organizations serve the needs of their members or clients in various ways, including but not limited to: legal representation, public policy advocacy, rights' campaigns, and educational outreach. Students will work directly with members and/or clients of these organizations as they draw upon human rights frameworks to make specific demands to ameliorate their circumstances.

IFEP IA7650,Central Bank Crisis Management,"The extraordinary policy responses of global central banks to the 2023 banking turmoil, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2007-2009 financial crisis have fostered debate about both the appropriateness and the effectiveness of central bank actions.   This course will discuss the theory and practice of “unconventional” monetary policy tools – i.e., those used to address financial crises, widespread deflation, and deep recessions or depressions.  Examples in the course will be drawn from a broad array of crises, countries, and central banks in both the developed and emerging world over many decades. 
  
 The bulk of the course will focus on how central banks adapt their policy rules and tools in response to extraordinary financial or economic turmoil. Different types of monetary policy tools will be discussed and analyzed, with particular focus on the design and the effectiveness of various crisis policy tools.  Central to understanding policy effectiveness will be consideration of how financial and macroeconomic conditions impact central bank policy design,  and in turn, how financial markets and the macroeconomy respond to extraordinary policies. 
  
Examples of the use of crisis management tools – both more and less successful – across jurisdictions will be discussed in the latter half of the course.   The course finishes with discussions of several important and timely dilemmas: Where is the “line” between crisis monetary policies and traditional fiscal policy actions?  Why was the (inflation) impact of COVID-19 policy responses so different from previous episodes of instability?   How do central bank “undo” their crisis management policies and return to “normal”?  What difficulties do central banks face in handling economic side effects and the political consequences of extraordinary policies?",Patricia C Mosser,,,10318,,U7650-20261-001,Central Bank Crisis Manag,International Finance & Economic Policy,IFEP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IFEP/U7650-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261IFEP7650U001,SEMINAR

Students will examine frameworks such as the G-Zero world, J-Curve, and state capitalism, and explore how they apply to real-world risks across countries and sectors. Taught by leading experts in the field, the course emphasizes interdisciplinary tools and methodologies for identifying, assessing, and managing political risk—including scenario planning, risk indices, and game-theory modeling. Through a combination of case studies, interactive practicums, and group presentations, students will apply these tools to current global challenges such as political transitions, social unrest, climate change, technological disruption, and great power conflict. The course prepares students to think strategically and forecast risk in public, private, and multilateral settings.",,,,10319,,U7700-20261-001,Applied Geopolitics,International Finance & Economic Policy,IFEP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IFEP/U7700-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261IFEP7700U001,SEMINAR
IFEP IA7820,Economic Measurement of Discrimination,"Discrimination is the differential treatment of people based on identity or perceived identity (race, gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ status, age, religion, disability, immigration status, etc.). Such behavior violates some legal, social, and moral norms and has a negative impact on those discriminated against.
  
For these and other reasons, it is important to be able to formally identify discrimination from data. But how do we know that A’s treatment of B is because of B’s identity as opposed to some other characteristic of B or A that we may not even have a variable for?
  
In this class, we will explore economists’ methodologies for answering this question. We will survey the economic literature on discrimination against a variety of types of people in a variety of markets and across countries. Students are encouraged to explore discrimination in contexts not covered in the reading in their final projects.",Ebonya L Washington,,,10320,,U7820-20261-001,Econ Measures-Discriminat,International Finance & Economic Policy,IFEP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IFEP/U7820-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261IFEP7820U001,SEMINAR

ISDI IA7200,Conduct of War,"The conduct of war is central to international security policy. Even when unused, the ability to wage war effectively underpins deterrence and shapes foreign policy. Military organization, training, and strategy are built around this capacity, and the institutions that support it exist largely to ensure effectiveness in conflict. A strong grasp of modern warfare theory and practice is essential for anyone pursuing a career in security policy. This course provides a foundation in the conduct of war, preparing students for professional roles in government agencies, legislative offices, think tanks, and international organizations. It focuses on developing the analytical skills and conceptual tools needed for early-career success and long-term growth in the defense policy field. While the course includes critical thinking and key concepts, it is intended as targeted professional preparation rather than general education. The course complements ISDI IA6000: Foundations of International Security Policy, ISDI IA7250: Military Technology Assessment, and ISDI IA7275: Methods for Defense Analysis.

ISDI IA7250,Military Technology Assessment,"Technology is central to modern defense debates in the United States and globally. Its assessment underpins core functions across the defense policy and planning community, including budgeting, modernization, intelligence, campaign planning, force design, and program management. In the U.S., this work spans think tanks, Defense Department offices, Congressional and Service staffs, the intelligence community, and the defense industry. These assessments influence hundreds of billions in spending and carry life-and-death stakes in wartime.
  
The demand for analysts with the ability to assess military technology is high. Thousands perform or rely on this work, making it a critical and widely applicable skill for early- and mid-career professionals in the defense field.
  
This course prepares students for that work by introducing the fundamentals of military technology and its analysis in policymaking contexts. It does not assume prior technical background, nor is it an engineering course. Instead, it focuses on how technologies function and interact under design constraints, and how to assess their operational utility.

Students will analyze how geopolitical shifts, institutional capacities, and strategic choices have influenced outcomes. The course pays particular attention to the United Nations' involvement, the evolution of doctrines such as the Responsibility to Protect, and the role of external actors.",Jean-Marie Guehenno,,,10326,,U7300-20261-001,Peacemaking: Lessons & Fa,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7300-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7300U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7350,Gender and International Security,"Gender has important implications for international security policy. Gender bias can influence policy choices, distort understandings of military capability—especially among nonstate armed groups with women combatants—and aggravate the causes of war. It can increase internal and interstate violence in settings where women are mistreated or where sex imbalances create instability. Gender also shapes how individuals experience wars and disasters, as existing inequalities are often intensified. Bias can discourage women from pursuing careers in security policy, limiting states’ access to a full range of talent.
  
The intersection of gender and security has been formally recognized since the 2000 passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS). International organizations such as NATO have developed WPS policies, and the United States passed the Women, Peace, and Security Act in 2017 to integrate gender into the work of the State and Defense Departments.
  
This course offers a sustained exploration of how gender identities and related power dynamics influence international and internal conflict, as well as security policy. Through case studies and examples, students will learn to conduct gender analyses and apply these skills through research, writing, and presentations. The course is structured as a discussion-based seminar to support collaborative learning.
  
The course begins by defining gender and international security and examining why these concepts are difficult to define. Later sessions address the intersection of gender with other identity factors, explore how security institutions are gendered, and consider how to create gender-responsive policies. The course concludes by analyzing gendered strategies in conflict and state responses to conflict.",Phoebe Donnelly,,,10327,,U7350-20261-001,Gender & Int'l Security,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7350-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7350U001,SEMINAR

Although leaders often invoke historical analogies, they tend to rely on a limited set of familiar episodes. Students will explore the value and limitations of using history to inform decisions about present and future challenges. The course introduces key tools of historical reasoning, including concepts such as continuity and change, contingency, human agency, and structural constraint. Students will also consider the risks of overreliance on analogy or using history to support predetermined conclusions.

Students will explore the governance and funding structures of over 35 UN agencies, programs, and funds, and analyze how they collaborate to achieve country-level results. Topics include joint responses to global crises, UNDS reforms, SDG financing, and partnerships with governments, donors, civil society, and the private sector. Drawing on real-world case studies and practitioner insights, the course emphasizes practical competencies in multilateral development cooperation.",Gulden Turkoz-Cosslett,,,10329,,U7404-20261-001,UN Development System Wor,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7404-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7404U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7406,United Nations and Globalization,"United Nations and Globalization
 introduces the various ways in which the United Nations affect global governance. Over the last decade, every aspect of global governance has become subjected to review and debate: peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the future of humanitarianism, a new climate change architecture, human rights, a new sustainable development agenda, and the need for a new understanding of multilateralism.
  
Part 1
 of this course introduces the different actors, entities, and platforms through which the UN affects global governance. It creates the conceptual foundations for the role of international organizations in today’s multiplex world. It sheds light on how the UN acts at various levels, in different forms and with a varied set of partners to foster global public goods and global public policy. This includes discussions on the role of international law, goal setting, and frameworks, as well as the interlinkages between global-level interventions and regional, national, and local activities and outcomes.
  
Part 2
 applies the conceptual insights to specific issue areas. Discussions on global governance mechanisms in the areas of peace and security, humanitarian action, sustainable development, climate change, human rights, gender, migration, global health, and COVID-19 deepen the understanding of the role the UN plays in global governance regimes more broadly.
  
In addition to critical scholarship on international organizations and global governance, the course relies on students’ analysis of relevant proceedings and debates at the UN, original policy documents, as well as expert testimony from a range of guest speakers, who share their extensive first-hand observations as actors of global governance processes. By these means, 
United Nations and Globalization
 offers insights into the processes, challenges, and impacts of UN activities to make global governance regimes stronger, more effective, and hold actors more accountable.",Daniel Naujoks,,,10331,,U7406-20261-001,United Nations & Globaliz,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7406-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7406U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7408,Risk Management for UN Crisis and Post-c,"This course introduces students to the theory and practice of risk management in crisis and conflict settings, with a focus on the United Nations’ efforts to deliver on mandates in complex environments. Drawing on UN doctrine and international standards such as ISO 31000, the course emphasizes practical skills and real-world applications across the UN’s peace and security, development, human rights, and humanitarian pillars. Students will engage with case studies, guest speakers, and group simulations, culminating in the development of a comprehensive risk assessment for a selected UN mandate. Topics include security risk management, access and protection, strategic communications, human rights, program and partner risks, political engagement, civil affairs, DDR, and mission transitions.",Marc Jacquand,,,10332,,U7408-20261-001,Risk Management for UN Cr,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7408-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7408U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7500,Basics of Cybersecurity,"The purpose of this half-semester course is to familiarize students with how the Internet and cybersecurity works; to provide a foundation of knowledge for later courses; and to familiarize students with the devices, protocols, and functions of computers, the Internet, industrial control systems, and cybersecurity. This course is not intended to be a computer science course, but to provide the students with the lexicon of cyberspace and the understanding of how hardware, software, and networks fit together to create the Internet experience. We will also illuminate some essential and current cybersecurity policy topics, including privacy and risks of emerging technology.
  
It is a broader course meant to complement Cyber Risks and Vulnerabilities and other coursework throughout SIPA.",Ian W Gray,,,10333,,U7500-20261-001,,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7500-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7500U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7502,Foundations of Cyber Conflict,"This course explores the strategic, policy, and institutional dimensions of cyber conflict. It focuses on the national security implications of cyber threats and responses, rather than the technical mechanics of cyberspace. Students will examine how cyber operations unfold at both tactical and strategic levels, assess the comparison of cyber power to other domains of conflict, and trace the development of U.S. cyber policy and organizational structures. There are no prerequisites, though students without prior exposure to cybersecurity are encouraged to complete the assigned foundational readings before the first class or take a 1.5-credit introductory course.",Jason Healey,,,10334,,U7502-20261-001,Foundations of Cyber Conf,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7502-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7502U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7508,Cyberspace in Modern Warfare,"This course examines the evolving role of cyberspace in modern warfare. Since the emergence of the Internet, scholars and policymakers have debated whether cyber capabilities represent a fundamental shift in the nature of conflict or a complement to conventional military power. Students will engage key conceptual debates about cyber conflict, assess how major powers including the United States, Israel, Russia, and China develop and employ cyber capabilities, and consider whether cyber operations should be viewed as a distinct strategic domain. The course also explores the future of cyber warfare, including the role of non-state actors and the integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and space-based systems. Through case studies and policy analysis, students will develop a framework for understanding how cyber strategy is shaped and executed in theory and practice.",Erica D Lonergan,,,10335,,U7508-20261-001,Cyberspace in Modern Warf,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7508-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7508U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7510,Cyber Risks and Vulnerabilities,"The purpose of this course is to familiarize SIPA students with the function of the internet while focusing on the flaws and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in attacks or impact user privacy.  This course will approach each session in the following manner: discussion of recent cyber events, discussion topic(s) to be covered, and the ramifications when used in the real world.
  
This course is intended to build on the Basics of Cybersecurity with a tighter focus on specific vulnerabilities and information transmission and how these can be exploited by hackers, criminals, spies, militaries, or business interests.
  
This course is intended to be an introduction to cyber risk and vulnerabilities and is thus suitable for complete newcomers to the area. It is a big field, with a lot to cover; however, this should get students familiar with all of the basics.  The class is divided into weekly topics; the first five iteratively build on each other, and the others either addressing recent technologies or hosting relevant guest speakers.
  
Many cyber jobs are opening up with companies that need international affairs analysts who, while not cybersecurity experts, understand the topic well enough to write policy recommendations or intelligence briefs.  Even if you don’t intend your career to focus on cyber issues, having some exposure will deepen your understanding of the dynamics of many other international, privacy, and public policy issues.",Elizabeth Cartier,,,10336,,U7510-20261-001,Cyber Risks and Vulnerabi,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7510-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7510U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7512,Cybersecurity and Business Risk,"This course introduces cybersecurity as a business risk, emphasizing its impact beyond IT and into areas such as regulation, governance, finance, and reputation. Students explore core concepts in cybersecurity, risk management frameworks, and the evolving threat landscape. The course examines how leading organizations assess, quantify, and address cyber risk through strategies such as risk mitigation, transfer, and resilience. Topics include incident response, supply chain vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance, critical infrastructure, and cyber conflict. Through policy memos and a group-designed risk taxonomy, students build practical tools for evaluating and managing cyber threats in public, private, and nonprofit sectors.",,,,10337,,U7512-20261-001,Cybersecurity & Business,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7512-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7512U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7524,Cyberspace in Strategy and Grand Strateg,"This course examines the role of cyberspace in national strategy and grand strategy, with a primary focus on the United States and select comparative cases. As the United States shifts from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency toward renewed great power competition, questions about the utility of force, alliance structures, economic statecraft, and international institutions are increasingly framed by strategic thinking. Although cyberspace influences nearly all instruments of national power, its role in debates about grand strategy remains underexplored. This course addresses that gap by evaluating how traditional concepts of strategy and grand strategy apply in the digital domain. Students will assess how cyberspace shapes the formulation and execution of strategy through military operations, diplomacy, intelligence, and economic tools.",Erica D Lonergan,,,10338,,U7524-20261-001,Cyberspace & Grand Strate,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7524-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7524U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7625,Conflict Resolution,"This course introduces the study and practice of international conflict resolution, providing students with a broad understanding of the subject and a framework for approaching more specific strands of study offered by CICR. Can a war be stopped before it starts? Is it realistic to talk about ‘managing’ a war and mitigating its consequences? What eventually brings adversaries to the negotiating table? How do mediation efforts unfold and how are the key issues resolved? Why do peace processes and peace agreements so often fail to bring durable peace? Students will address these and other fundamental questions in order to develop an understanding of international conflict resolution.",,,,10339,,U7625-20261-001,,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7625-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7625U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7630,Mediation in a World in Flux,"This course explores the challenges and opportunities in international peacemaking, with a particular focus on mediation as a tool for advancing political solutions to violent conflict. Complementing other CICR courses, it offers students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of how various mediators—including the United Nations, multilateral institutions, states, and non-governmental organizations—are responding to shifting dynamics in global conflict and politics.
  
The course considers key questions: What factors hinder current conflict resolution efforts? How have mediators adapted to changes in geopolitics, the fragmentation of non-state armed groups, and a crowded mediation landscape? How should they continue to adapt, especially amid declining resources for peace and humanitarian efforts and growing resistance to established norms?
  
Students will also examine how mediators can engage conflict parties on emerging issues, including the effects of the climate crisis and digital technologies on conflict dynamics and peace processes.",Teresa Whitfield,,,10340,,U7630-20261-001,Mediation in a World in F,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7630-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7630U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7664,Applied Peacebuilding and Conflict Resol,"This course prepares students to engage in peacebuilding practice by developing fieldwork-related competencies rooted in critical reflection, professional strategy, and ethical engagement. Students examine foundational values, frameworks, and dilemmas in the peacebuilding field, while cultivating skills in project design, monitoring and evaluation (MEAL), communication, collaboration, and cultural awareness.
  
Structured as the first part of a spring-summer-fall sequence, the course introduces peacebuilding theory and practice through seminar-style discussions and applied assignments. Students collaborate with vetted field-based partner institutions to design projects aligned with real-world needs. These projects are implemented through optional summer internships, followed by a fall debrief session with the incoming cohort.
  
Coursework emphasizes partnership with local actors, conflict sensitivity, reflective practice, and an openness to critique and adaptation. Students are expected to grapple with the complexity of field conditions and to develop strategies for self-care, ethical engagement, and navigating uncertainty. Assignments include reflective journals, a midterm conflict analysis and thematic research paper, and a final project design paper.
  
Please note: All fieldwork and associated travel are voluntary and student-funded, though external funding opportunities may be available.",Zachary B Metz,,,10341,,U7664-20261-001,Peacebuilding Fieldwork,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7664-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7664U001,SEMINAR

ISDI IA7902,"The U.S. Role in World Affairs, II","This course is the second half of the year-long International Fellows Program (IFP) seminar examining the United States’ evolving role in global affairs. Building on themes from the fall, the spring semester focuses on the challenges confronting a new U.S. presidential administration and the strategic decisions that will shape American leadership in a contested international environment. Through a combination of seminar discussions, case studies, guest speakers, and two regional crisis simulations, students will examine U.S. policy responses to geopolitical competition, regional instability, and transnational threats. Enrollment is limited to students in the International Fellows Program (IFP).",Victoria Nuland,,,10345,,U7902-20261-001,U.S. Role in World Affair,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7902-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7902U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA8878,"Nuclear Theory, Politics, and Strategies","Nuclear weapons are often considered to pose humanity’s gravest danger. Yet despite nuclear threats and crises, states have managed to avoid the deliberate or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons since the end of World War II. Eighty years after Hiroshima, how has nuclear war been avoided? Did the advent of nuclear weapons create a revolution in military affairs that stalemated major powers and dramatically reduced the prospects of great power war by the emergence of mutual vulnerability and mutual assured destruction (MAD) postures? Or are nuclear weapons central to great power competition and valuable instruments of force, including for deterrence and coercion? Is there a taboo against nuclear use? Do the major theories about the nuclear era match actual practice and how has nuclear theory evolved? Are the strategies and approaches that were employed in the past still appropriate for the new multipolar nuclear age? Why do some states acquire nuclear weapons while others that have considered going nuclear (e.g., South Korea and Germany) so far forego the option, while still others (e.g., South Africa and Ukraine) have given up their nuclear weapons? What are the prospects for continued nuclear proliferation and hedging (e.g., Iran)?
  
This class will explore past and current patterns of behavior among existing, potential, and former nuclear weapons states. Other questions that animate this course include: What do nuclear weapons actually deter? Can they be used for coercion? How do operational plans and force postures serve military and political objectives? What are the incentives, disincentives and risks of strategies premised on deliberate escalation to nuclear use? Do they increase the probability of inadvertent use of nuclear weapons? What role do nuclear weapons play in U.S. strategy and security policies? How does the U.S. experience compare to those of other nuclear weapon states, such as USSR/Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea? This seminar will examine such questions to gain a better understanding of the importance of nuclear weapons for international relations.",Cynthia A Roberts,,,10346,,U8878-20261-001,"Nuclear Theory, Politics,",International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U8878-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI8878U001,SEMINAR

MDES UN2000,"ETHNICITY, RACE, IDENTITY IN THE PRE-MOD","This seminar investigates the concepts of ethnicity, race, and identity, in both theory and practice,
 through a comparative survey of several case studies from the Pre-Modern history of the Middle East.
 The course focuses on symbols of identity and difference, interpreting them through a variety of
 analytical tools, and evaluating the utility of each as part of an ongoing exploration of the subject. The
 survey considers theories of ethnicity and race, as well as their critics, and includes cases from the
 Ancient World (c. 1000 BCE) through the Old Regime (c. 1800 CE).
  
 Students in this course will gain a familiarity with major theories of social difference and alterity, and
 utilize them to interpret and analyze controversial debates about social politics and identity from the
 history of the Middle East, including ancient ethnicity, historical racism, Arab identity, pluralism in the
 Islamic Empire, and slavery, among others. In addition, students will spend much of the semester
 developing a specialized case study of their own on a historical community of interest. All of the case
 studies will be presented in a showcase at the end of the semester.
  
 All assigned readings for the course will be in English. Primary sources will be provided in translation.
 The course meets once a week and sessions are two hours long.",Nathanael P Shelley,4:00pm,6:00pm,00407,,W2000-20261-001,"ETHNICITY, RACE, IDENTITY",Asian and Middle East @Barnard,MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W2000-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261MDES2000W001,SEMINAR
MDES UN2399,ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LITERATURE,"This colloquium is a course on many influential texts of literature from Ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Sumerian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Canaanite, and others. The emphasis is on investigating the literary traditions of each culture – the subject matter, form, methods, and symbolism– that distinguish them from one another and from later traditions of the Middle East. The course is not
 a “civilization” course, nor is it a history class, although elements of culture and history will be mentioned as necessary. The course is intended to provide a facility with, and an awareness of, the content and context of ancient works of literature in translation from the Ancient Middle East.
  
 Students in this course will gain a familiarity with the major cultures of the Ancient Middle East, the best known and most remarked upon stories, and the legacy of those works on some later traditions. The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.

Animal models are crucial to biological research. Without fruit flies we would know little about genetic inheritance or how genes relate to fundamental behaviors, such as circadian rhythms. Without the barn owl we would not fully understand how the brain detects interaural time differences and localizes sounds. Without echolocating bats our knowledge of three-dimensional navigation and memory would be diminished. Through the study of animal systems that are specialized for particular sensory and motor acts, scientists have been able to dissect the circuit computations underlying key behaviors, such as decision making, prey detection, foraging, mate selection, and communication, that are fundamental across species. Through short introductory talks and in-depth discussions of primary scientific literature, this course will provide a foundation for understanding these behaviors, and relate discoveries in animal research to broader themes in neurobiology, ecology, and medicine.",Abigail N Zadina,,,00040,,X3385-20261-001,,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3385-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261NSBV3385X001,SEMINAR

 of the trauma may influence neural processes influencing social relatedness, attachment, emotional regulation, physiological homeostasis and the stress response.  Neuroscientific research provides insight into these processes and informs pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for individual survivors.
  
Students will review neuroscientific theoretical models and research relevant to the neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and neurodevelopmental processes underlying the traumatic response. The neuroendocrine system and its relevance will also be reviewed.   The course will begin with a critical review of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) diagnosis of Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders, to acquire an understanding of the symptoms and diagnosis.  Next, students will review theory and research relevant to trauma and neurobiology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.  Finally, students will critique the application of these research findings to the design of current “neuro-informed” therapeutic interventions.  Throughout the course, individual case studies will provide insight into the brain’s influence on symptomatology and foster greater understanding and sensitivity to the personal post-traumatic experience.",E'Mett McCaskill,,,00042,,X3405-20261-001,,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3405-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261NSBV3405X001,LECTURE
NSBV BC3591,NEUROSCIENCE GUIDED RESEARCH,"This lab-based course introduces students to advanced methods in cognitive neuroscience, focusing on the application of electroencephalography (EEG) for real-time recording of brain activity. Unlike traditional approaches that study how the brain responds to different external stimuli or task demands, this course centers on spontaneous brain activity that occurs during rest or just before experimental events. Whether or not spontaneous brain activity is just meaningless noise remains an active area of research in cognitive neuroscience. Some researchers believe that spontaneous brain activity may be an important factor shaping our subjective experience of the world. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive in part due to the challenges in objectively defining and measuring subjective experience.
  
In this course, students will address this challenge by developing methods to study the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and subjective experience, with a particular focus on mind-wandering and the sensory phenomena elicited by Ganzflicker and Ganzfeld stimulation. The course culminates in independent research projects where students test their hypotheses by collecting and analyzing behavioral and EEG data. Key questions to address include: can spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity account for why people sometimes zone out while performing a task? Can the same fluctuations explain why people sometimes have different sensory experiences despite constant external stimuli? Do individual variations in spontaneous brain activity help explain why some people are more likely to report such experiences?

PEPM IA8250,Financial Development,"Open to all SIPA with pre-req or concurrent-req: Macroeconomics. 
This course aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of financial development over time and across countries, with an emphasis on public policy. Topics include a review of the foundations and processes of financial development; the roles of markets, instruments, and institutions; issues related to systemic financial stability; links to financial repression and globalization; and the developmental and oversight roles of the state. Financial activities arise in response to the interplay of a few easily identifiable frictions and related market failures, operating within an evolving institutional environment and uncertain macroeconomic context. Finance has both a bright side (welfare-enhancing financial development) and a dark side (financial instability and potential excess finance).
  
This conceptualization of financial development is supported by a review of the fundamental foundations of finance through simple modeling exercises, statistical illustrations of financial trends, and references to specific country experiences, many drawn from the work of IMF or World Bank financial sector-related missions.

This course examines how thinkers of contrasting perspectives have understood capitalism politically. Some have celebrated the market as an escape from coercion, while others criticize it as a source of disguised domination; some see capitalism as leveling social hierarchies, while others point to its creation of class and racial hierarchy; some see capitalism as an engine of wealth creation and heightened living standards, while others emphasize its destruction of existing ways of life and production of inequality; some see capitalism as an engine of peace, while others emphasize its reliance on violence.

To what extent and under what circumstances do elected officials consider public preferences in making policy? To what extent and under what circumstances might we want them to? What kind of power should the public have in American democracy? Thinking about the second and third, more normative questions leads us to other empirical questions. What shapes public preferences? How well can we measure them? How much do people know and care about politics? How do they evaluate their representatives? What constitutes high quality representation? We will examine these kinds of questions broadly, and also consider how they play out in particular policy areas and historical moments. We will also discuss the dynamics of public opinion across population subgroups (e.g. by race, sex, income, party, urbanity, etc.), and questions surrounding representation at the group level. In addition to engaging scholarly literature on public opinion and representation, students will also learn to access, manage, and analyze data measuring the composition of the public (e.g. the U.S. Census) as well as public views on political candidates, officeholders, institutions, and issues (e.g. survey data). These skills will help to prepare students for research projects in other courses and beyond Barnard.

Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit economies touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, environmental degradation, state corruption, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others.

POLS BC3801,COLL:POLITICS OF DEVELOPMENT,"Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent Description: The semester-long course aims to study political and social factors behind economic development and exam empirical cases of the success and failure in economic growth in order to understand the key features of the development processes. In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3. Understand some country specific political economy processes and how these processes prove or disprove certain theories and policies.",Xiaobo Lu,,,00497,,X3801-20261-001,COLL:POLITICS OF DEVELOPM,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3801-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261POLS3801X001,COLLOQUIA
POLS UN1101,POLITICAL THEORY I,This course considers key questions at the foundation of political thought.  What is justice?  How do we justify the coercive power of states? Do we have an obligation to obey the government? Who should make and enforce the law?  What basic rights and liberties should governments protect? How should our economic system produce and divide wealth and material resources?  What are the claims of excluded or marginalized groups and how can these claims be addressed?   We explore these questions through the works of several classical and contemporary political thinkers.  A major goal of the course is to practice the skills needed to understand a political thinker’s arguments and to construct one’s own.,Alyssa Battistoni,,,00489,,V1101-20261-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/V1101-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261POLS1101V001,LECTURE

Second, how can we account for the differences between autocracies and democracies? Third, what different institutional forms does democratic government take? Finally, are some institutions more likely than others to produce desirable social outcomes such as accountability, redistribution, and political stability?",,,,00490,,V1501-20261-001,INTRO TO COMPARATIVE POLI,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/V1501-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261POLS1501V001,LECTURE

It also reveals a broader trend: in the early 1990s, it seemed that Western liberal values were triumphant worldwide. However, as Russia failed to transition into a democratic state, anti-Americanism and revanchism began to flourish. After becoming president, Vladimir Putin exploited these sentiments, ultimately making anti-Americanism a central aspect of his international political agenda. Russian propaganda has not only influenced the Russian population but also seeks to spread these ideas and conspiracy theories beyond Russia’s borders. As an inherently unstable political system, Russia aims to destabilize the West.

RELI BC3096,"More than Real: Dreams, Imagination, and","This course is thematic, though a loose history of dreaming, imaginative praxis, and virtual reality environments across South Asia will emerge through the networked conversations across texts. The advantage of a thematic course allows us to cover various genres such as: ritual manuals; epic; poetry; philosophical argument; biographical accounts; prophecies; conversion stories; and medical textbooks to name a handful. At the end of the course, we will see how the texts encountered in the first part have been repurposed to speak to social justice movements around caste - both within South Asia and the diaspora population in the U.S. The thematic of dreaming and imagination also provides flexibility in method: because students will have the opportunity to study conversations between different historical actors across religious traditions about dreams, they will also have the opportunity to revise problematic accounts of religious pluralism and communalism in South Asia. Students will read primary texts from Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Sikh traditions to name a handful. Students can look forward to reading about worlds within rocks; falling asleep and waking up as another person only to die in the dream world, wake up and then realize your dream-life family is somehow real and looking for you; how to finally interpret those pesky dreams about teeth falling out; dismembered bodies generating the universe; daydreaming about a cloud that thinks mountain peaks look like nipples; how to build a mind-temple that Shiva prefers to the physical one with fancy rock; and much more!",Meghan E Hartman,,,00206,,X3096-20261-001,More Than Real,Religion @Barnard,RELI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X3096-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261RELI3096X001,SEMINAR

RELI UN3323,Religion and Medicine in South Asia: Psy,"In this course, students will come to see the imbrication of religion, power, and mental illness across South Asia by examining experiences of suffering and its management; the history of psychiatry in the British colonial era and its afterlives; and the relationship of religion to concepts of mental and emotional disorder. Students will identify models for medical structures of care, healing, and treatments in the context of religion, ritual, and quotidian life. Topics include diagnostic processes and the creation of categories, stigma and models of clinical care, hysteria, spirit possession, pharmaceuticals, and the relationship of trauma to political structures. This course has three sections: 1) the first portion undertakes a brief historical survey of medical disciplines and institutions in South Asia (such as the development of Ayurveda, Yunānī Ṭibb, and the rise of the bīmāristān); 2) the second portion of the course focuses on the rise of the asylum (sometimes called the pāgal khāna) in tandem with psychiatry and its twinned consequence: the pathologization of asceticism by British colonial technologies of discipline; 3) the final portion examines the relationship between British colonialism and psychoanalysis with the introduction of this western discipline to the subcontinent. 
  
This course will take

 stock of historical structures throughout South Asia

 to provide care (such as family, caste, healthcare, mental asylums, colonialism, educational systems, pensions, and much more). As a result, students come to consider concepts of social suffering, biopolitics, biosociality, political subjectivity, and postcolonial disorder.

SDEV IA9248,Collective Action for Global Sustainable,"When externalities go uncorrected, and public goods go undersupplied, the reason is not that the market fails; the reason is that governments are unable or unwilling to intervene effectively. The biggest problem is with transnational externalities and regional and global public goods. This is partly because of the scale of these problems, but it is also because the institutional arrangements at this level make effective intervention difficult. There is no World Government. Instead, there are around 200 sovereign states. To support sustainable development globally, states must cooperate, and yet states' self-interests often conflict with their collective interests. This is why all countries agree that collective action must be taken to limit climate change, and yet, though they try and try again, countries seem unable to muster the individual action needed to meet their own collective goal. The aim of this course is to develop an apparatus for understanding international collective action for sustainable development. By an apparatus, I mean a theory, a structured way of looking at and understanding the world. Rather than just present the theory, my aim is to show you why theory is needed, how it has been constructed, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Basically, in addition to teaching you principles and tools, I want you to come to see how this field has developed, what it has achieved, and where it has fallen short. Throughout the course, we shall also be looking at tests and applications of the theory-empirical and experimental papers in addition to case studies. The course draws from a number of disciplines, especially economics, game theory (analytical and experimental), and international relations-but also international law, philosophy, history, the natural and physical sciences, and engineering. The focus will be on institutions, and the way that they restructure the relations among states to cause states to behave differently-that is, to cause them to undertake collective action. In terms of applications, the course will address not only climate change but also depletion of the ozone layer, trans-boundary air pollution, pollution of the oceans, over-fishing, biodiversity loss, and the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.",Scott Barrett,1:10pm,3:00pm,10260,,U9248-20261-001,Collective Action-Global,PHD-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,SDEV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/U9248-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,W,20261SDEV9248U001,SEMINAR

SOCI BC3202,Structural Determinants of Health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the “Social” Determinants of Health to the “Structural” Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes. An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities. Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual’s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one’s class position and the color of one’s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experie",Maati Momplaisir,,,00018,,X3202-20261-001,STRUCTURAL DETERMNTS OF H,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/X3202-20261-001/,,,,3,,,20261SOCI3202X001,LECTURE

SPAN BC3693,Disability Narratives in Latin America,"This course surveys Latin American literary texts that have deeply engaged with disability in the
 20 th and 21 st century. Against the tendency to treat disability merely as a useful metaphor or to
 simply import Global Northern vocabulary and methodologies of disability studies to other
 locations, this course turns to Latin American literary texts by authors that have been directly
 “touched” by disability to foreground the concerns, vocabularies, and commitments that their
 texts reveal. This includes authors who either through their personal experience with disability
 or as caretakers—as parents, siblings, or close friends of people with disabilities—have closely
 grappled with the experience of non-normative bodies and minds in the Latin American
 context. In this course we ask how are subjects with disabilities represented in a variety of
 genres (novel, essay, poem, graphic novel) and what constraints and possibilities circumscribe
 these subjectivities and their lives. Ultimately, we will ask what vision of disability justice
 emerges from these localized experiences and creative interventions beyond now globalized
 disability discourses of inclusion/access and independence/autonomy.",Maja Horn,,,00184,,X3693-20261-001,Disability Narratives Lat,Spanish and Latin American Culture,SPAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/X3693-20261-001/,,,,4,,,20261SPAN3693X001,SEMINAR

THTR UN3008,PERFORMING GREEK TRAGEDY ON THE MODERN S,"This course aims to explore performing Greek tragedy on the modern stage. It will include an introduction to original performance practices in ancient Greece (space, masking, choral performance, costume, acting techniques) and an examination of how artists from different contemporary theatrical traditions have adapted ancient texts in modern performances and new versions of the plays. The bulk of the course will be focused on the problems of acting, interpreting, and reinterpreting parts of three plays on the stage, Sophocles’ 
Antigone
, Euripides’ 
Medea
, and Sophocles’ 
Ajax
 along with a new version by Ellen McLaughlin, who teaches playwriting at Barnard, 
Ajax in Iraq
. Students will view all or parts of particularly interesting recent productions from various theatrical traditions, which will help them to tackle challenging issues such as choral performance and choral rhythms, masking, character work, dialogues and presenting formal political debates.
  
For contemporary actors training in Greek tragedy offers a unique opportunity to improve their performance on stage through ensemble work and representing character through speech.  It enhances dramaturgical capacities that a contemporary theater practitioner must exercise in exploring theory in practice and vice versa.
  
This class is directed to students particularly interested in dramaturgy, directing, designing, translation, and Greek tragedy as well as acting.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,00345,,V3008-20261-001,PERF GREEK TRAGDY ON MOD,Theatre @Barnard,THTR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/THTR/V3008-20261-001/,LL200 Diana Center,,"Barnard College

Through a grounding in postcolonial theory, students will explore how the colonial encounter leaves a lasting impact on language and performance. How do these playwrights tackle questions of authenticity, influence, inspiration and agency? What stories do they adapt, translate or reimagine? Also, we read in equal measure male and female playwrights, attending to the ways in which power and authority are negotiated by them. This class looks both at plays that are seminal to postcolonial writing and also newer ones that unsettle the position of the greats. Do we then understand postcolonialism as a historically bound literary trend or an ongoing process of exploration? Fundamentally we ask, in our efforts to decolonize the theatre, how do we find new ways or reading?  Course fulfills lecture/seminar in drama studies, theatre studies, performance studies requirement for Theatre major.",Shayoni Mitra,12:10pm,2:00pm,00347,,V3157-20261-001,POSTCOLONIAL DRAMA,Theatre @Barnard,THTR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/THTR/V3157-20261-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

TPIN IA7002,Policy Solutions for Online Mis/Disinfor,"While 2016 may have been the wake-up call, it is clear that what scholar Joan Donovan calls “the weaponization of the misinformation machine” has only gotten worse since then. The political, social, and psychological damage caused by the intensive dissemination of online mis/disinformation has been profound. However, much has been learned about how to address the problem, so we will emphasize understanding the role of Big Tech in circulating and profiting from online mis/disinformation and what policies/regulations are in play. This semeste,r we are paying particular attention to the aftermath of the 2024 election landscape and the  strange post-truth  environment we find  ourselves  in.  
  
The first part of this course will focus on understanding mis/disinformation online. What exactly is it? Why should we care? What are the implications for Democracy? Who is the cast of characters creating mis/disinformation online? After we’ve understood  these topics we will examine  the fixes being proposed and tried globally. We will consider both the demand and supply side of the problem  and  national context shapes the solutions  being tried. We will look  at the pros  and   cons  of efforts  to  promote responsible news consumption, enhance media literacy, fact-checking, and new regulations. Along the way, we will also discuss content moderation, platform liability, disclosure requirements for election advertising, and support for journalism.  
  
 Students who take this class will develop an understanding of:  
  
  
The problem of online misinformation and disinformation— who is putting it online and what are their interests?

This course explores the institutions, stakeholder groups, and policy debates that shape how the internet is built, maintained, and governed. It examines the internet’s technical roots and the people and entities—telecom companies and their regulators, technologists and idealists, security forces and hackers—who shape its evolution today.
  
Students will study the basic workings of internet and mobile networks, the national and global forums where internet policy is made, and how digital regulation affects people, rights, cultures, and economies. Class sessions combine lectures, group discussions, guest speakers, and hands-on simulations to explore real-world tensions between national sovereignty and borderless cyberspace, corporate responsibility and civil liberties, and differing digital norms across regions.
  
The international human rights framework is presented as a foundation for policymaking in the digital age. Course topics include intermediary liability, domain name systems, surveillance, privacy, net neutrality, AI, disinformation, digital identity, and internet shutdowns.

TPIN IA7006,Digital Content Provenance: Path to Tran,"This course explores one of the most promising responses to the risks posed by Generative AI: digital content provenance. As AI-generated media grows more sophisticated and accessible, questions of transparency and authenticity have become central to the global informational ecosystem. Digital content provenance—an emerging open standard supported by thousands of organizations and recognized in recent policy actions such as the White House Executive Order on AI—offers a potential path to restoring trust in what we see and hear online.
  
Students will examine the technical foundations of provenance, including concepts such as public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities, and learn how provenance is being implemented across sectors including government, media, and technology. The course features guest speakers from industry and public service, providing insight into the policy, legal, and operational dimensions of this fast-evolving field.

TPIN IA7008,Principles & Practice of Online Trust &,"What rules and expectations should online platforms such as Google, Meta, X, OpenAI, TikTok, or Uber use to govern themselves? How do technology companies mitigate socio-technical harms stemming from their products? And how should they respond to evolving geopolitical conflicts playing out on their services? This course introduces the emerging field of Trust & Safety: the study of how online platforms are abused and how these systems can cause individual and societal harms, as well as the frameworks and tools used to prevent and mitigate those harms.
  
Still relatively obscure but increasingly central to public policy and technology governance, Trust & Safety now spans issues including content moderation, disinformation, child safety, algorithmic harm, and state-sponsored influence operations. Students will build foundational knowledge of the field through academic texts, practitioner case studies, and engagement with tools, taxonomies, and governance approaches used in industry. Course topics include detection systems, enforcement methods, moderation tradeoffs, transparency frameworks, red teaming, and regulatory perspectives such as the EU Digital Services Act. Case studies will examine harms across the technological stack, from social media to video games, dating apps, and AI models.

TPIN IA7012,Artificial Intelligence: A Survey for Po,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have emerged as increasingly ubiquitous technologies in a wide range of areas, such as finance, healthcare, workforce management, and advertising, in addition to several domains in the public sector, including but not limited to criminal justice and law enforcement. In the past several years, ethical questions about how and whether to use AI for particular tasks have become much more prominent, partly due to its widespread use and partly due to publicly documented failures or shortcomings of a number of systems that can negatively impact people in sometimes serious ways.
  
This course will provide a broad overview of practical, ethical, and governance questions related to AI — such as those related to privacy, cybersecurity, fairness, transparency, and more — with a view towards policymaking. Policymaking will be interpreted broadly, including both the public and private sectors. The course will include a survey of how machine learning works so as to ground the discussion, as well as a wide range of concrete, real-world examples and case studies.

As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field. Students in the course will approach cities from a number of disciplines, not only through the reading, but also through assignments that take place in different locations throughout New York City.",Andreina Torres Angarita,,,00420,,V1515-20261-001,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STU,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V1515-20261-001/,,,"Barnard College

URBS UN2520,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN PLANNING,"This course is a basic introduction to the field and practice of urban planning in the United States. The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment.
  
The core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more “livable” cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice.
  
The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning.",Noah Allison,2:40pm,3:55pm,00422,,V2520-20261-001,INTRO TO URBAN PLANNING,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V2520-20261-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

URBS UN3310,"RACE. SPACE, URB SCHOOLS","Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools. And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.

Readings and discussion focus on the history of metropolitan area expansion and economic development, as well as contemporary social processes shaping racial and ethnic groups’ access to high-quality public goods and private amenities. We address racial and ethnic groups’ evolving political agendas in today’s increasingly market-driven socio-political context, noting the roles of residents; federal, state, and local governments; market institutions and actors; urban planners, activist organizations, foundations, and social scientists, among others. Here is a sample of specific topics: race/ethnicity and who “belongs” in what “place;” inequitable government and market investment across racial and ethnic communities over time and “sedimentation effects” (for example, the “redlining” of Black communities leading to their inability to access loan and credit markets and the resulting wealth gap between Blacks and Whites); gentrification processes; creating sufficient, sustainable tax bases; and suburban sprawl.

URBS UN3800,ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Prerequisite: Successful completion of URBS UN2200 Introduction to GIS Methods, or equivalent with instructor permission.
  
With the veritable explosion of urban data alongside the continued proliferation of new tools for its consideration, this course allows students to develop specialized approaches to spatial analysis while introducing a series of common advanced techniques and nuanced methodological questions. Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.
  
Among others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.
  
The course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar. Seminar-style presentation and discussion will rely heavily on student participation and preparation to consider the variety of spatial methods available and their implications on urban research and intervention. Woven throughout the semester is the development of a self-driven research project, through which students will engage and compare the methodological advantages and disadvantages of several assumptions, approaches, analyses, and datasets.",Leah M Meisterlin,2:10pm,4:00pm,00433,,V3800-20261-001,ADVANCED GIS,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3800-20261-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

URSP IA7150,Seminar in Urban Politics and Policy,"All public policy occurs within a political context. The purpose of this seminar is to examine how politics impacts policy in America’s large cities. While we rely on case material from American cities, the theoretical frameworks, problems, and policy solutions we consider are relevant to understanding public policy in any global city.
  
Cities are not legal entities defined in the American Constitution. Yet, historically, they have developed a politics and policymaking process that at once seems archetypically American and strangely foreign. We will consider who has power in cities and how that impacts policy priorities; whether America’s traditional institutions of representation “work” for urban America; how the city functions within our federal system; and whether neighborhood democracy is a meaningful construct. We will also consider the impact of politics on urban policymaking. Can cities solve the myriad problems of their populations under existing institutional arrangements? How are cities being affected by the post-pandemic work-from-home economy? Do the economic and social factors that impact urban politics and policy limit a city’s capacity to find and implement solutions to urban problems? How has increasing income inequality and persistent racial discrimination impacted urban governance and policy making? Does political protest result in changes in urban policy? Finally, can urban politics be restructured to better address problems of inequity and racial justice.

Since the founding of the United States, political institutions have shaped evolving definitions of race, and racial inequality has remained a persistent feature of American society. As a result, race and politics remain inextricably linked.
  
The course examines how racial disparities—and efforts to address them—affect local, state, and national political dynamics. Drawing frequently on examples from New York City, students will analyze intergroup relations among Black, white, Latino, and Asian communities, as well as the causes and consequences of contemporary racial mobilization. The course will also address the influence of executive leadership, including the ongoing impact of the Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies on racial discourse and governance.
  
Students will begin with a historical overview of race as an organizing concept, then turn to contemporary themes such as inequality, governance, and the role of institutions in perpetuating or challenging systemic disparities. Topics include disenfranchisement, gentrification, civil rights, economic mobility, and spatial access.
  
The course engages a range of policy areas, including education, immigration, housing, health, elections, poverty, political representation, transportation, and criminal justice. These will be considered in relation to party politics, group identity, coalition building, and intergroup conflict, with attention to both change and continuity in the intersection of race and American public life.
  
Guiding questions include: What role does collective racial identity play in shaping policy demands? Should race-based policymaking continue at the local, national, or international level? What lessons can be drawn from coalition politics in New York City and beyond? And what does meaningful political change look like in the twenty-first century United States?",Christina M Greer,,,10442,,U7320-20261-001,Race & Politics in the U.,Urban and Social Policy,URSP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URSP/U7320-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261URSP7320U001,SEMINAR

This introductory course for the Interdisciplinary Concentration or Minor in Race and Ethnicity (ICORE/MORE) as well as Majors/Minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is open to all students. We focus on the critical study of social difference as an interdisciplinary practice, using texts with diverse modes of argumentation and evidence to analyze social differences as fundamentally entangled and co-produced. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this course, the professor will frequently be joined by other faculty and guest speakers who bring distinct disciplinary and subject matter expertise. Some keywords for this course include hybridity, diaspora, borderlands, migration, and intersectionality.",Marisa Solomon,2:10pm,4:00pm,00627,,X2150-20261-001,PRACTICING INTERSECTIONALITY,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X2150-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20261WMST2150X001,LECTURE
WMST BC4325,EMBODIMENT AND BODILY DIFFERENCE,"At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersection of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures—including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies—to consider some of the ways in which the body is constituted by such discourses, and itself serves as the substratum for social relations. Among the key questions we will consider are the following: What is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between presumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic and somatic experiences?  How do historical and political-economic forces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference? And most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by competing logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance to these and other categorizations?",Margot L Kotler,12:10pm,2:00pm,00610,,X4325-20261-001,EMBODIMENT & BODILY DIFFE,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X4325-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,F,20261WMST4325X001,SEMINAR
WMST GU4310,CONTEM AMER JEWISH WOMEN'S LIT,"The seminar will focus on trends that have emerged over the past three decades in Jewish American women's writing in the fields of memoirs, fiction and Jewish history: the representation and exploration through fictive narratives of women's experiences in American Jewish orthodox communities; reinterpretation of Jewish history through gender analysis; the recording of migration and exile by Jewish women immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Morocco, Iran, and Egypt; and gender transformations. Texts will be analyzed in terms of genre structures, narrative strategies, the role of gender in shaping content and Jewish identity, and the political, cultural and social contexts in which the works were created. The course aims for students to discuss and critically engage with texts in order to develop the skills of analytical and abstract thinking, as well as the ability to express that critical thinking in writing.
