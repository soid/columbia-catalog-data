ACCT B8007,Financial Planning & Analysis,"This course explores the use of financial information for internal planning, analysis, and decision-making. The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.
Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm’s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.
The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization’s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors’ internal-reporting mistakes.
To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.
We will examine the following key topics:
Designing managerial information systems to support an organization’s strategy.
Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.
Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.
The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.
The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.
Activity-based costing and activity-based management.
Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.
Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.
The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.
The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",Tim Baldenius,9:00am,10:30am,14501,,B8007-20261-001,Financial Planning & Anal,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8007-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

ACCT B8008,Earnings Quality & Fundamental,"Financial reporting provides a window into the operational and financial workings of a company. However, translating this information into actionable insights is anything but straightforward. It requires an understanding of: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the quality of financial information, and the adjustments and analyses used to assess profitability, risk, growth, and value.
 
 The course starts with a short review of financial reporting and then focuses on various modules of fundamental analysis, including earnings quality analysis, performance evaluation, risk assessment, forecasting, and valuation. The remaining class meetings (approximately 14 out of 24) are devoted to a deeper dive into the reporting and analysis of key transactions (e.g., business combinations, leasing) and financial statement line items (e.g., revenue, income taxes).
 
 To allow for dynamic progress, the class schedule is flexible:
 Topic Approximate # of class meetings
 1. Review of financial reporting 2
 2. Financial statement analysis 4
 3. Forecasting and valuation 4
 4. Revenue and related items 2
 5. Operating capacity 3
 6. Estimated items 3.5
 7. Financial instruments 2
 8. Investments in businesses 2.5
 9. Equity and related items 1
 Total 24
 
 While the course covers the theoretical underpinning of the various analyses, it focuses on implementation and practical uses. We will study many actual financial disclosures and cases of accounting abuses, and we will conduct fundamental-based valuation and other financial analyses, including using Excel tools that will be provided to the students. Studying financial disclosures will help you better understand the underlying assumptions and accounting choices the firm made in arriving at its accounting numbers. This information can be used to make earnings quality adjustments to the accounting numbers to make them more consistent across time or more comparable across companies. Studying cases of accounting abuses will help you improve your ability to “read between the lines” and develop a set of red flags to look for in analyzing financial statements. The class also incorporates insights from practitioner and academic research.

ACCT B8009,Financial Statement Analysis a,"This course will provide students with hands-on experience analyzing financial statements. Students will learn about the general tools, theoretical concepts, and practical valuation issues of financial analysis. By the end of the course, students should be comfortable using firms' financial statements (along with other information) to assess firm performance and make reasonable valuation estimates.
 
 Course content and organization In the first half of the course, we will develop a valuation framework that integrates a firm’s strategy, its financial performance, and the credibility of its accounting. The framework consists of the following steps:
 1. Understand the firm’s strategy. We will assess the firm’s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.
 2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.
 3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.
 4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.
 5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm’s current value.

ACCT B8027,Sustainability Reporting,"Broadly speaking, the goal of this class is to provide students with both the theoretical and practical knowledge to understand the current challenges in accounting for firms’ ESG goals. In this rapidly evolving field, the course will be structured in four modules:
 
 - Module #1 reviews the need for sustainability accounting and provide an overview of the providers of ESG metrics and the limits of current
 aggregated ESG data.
 - Module #2 present various market-based mechanisms to create ESG standards
 - Module #3 discusses regulatory initiatives to create ESG information for listed firms
 - Module #4 departs from non-financial disclosure and discuss the limits of current accounting standards and introduce new developments to
 incorporate ESG characteristics into traditional financial statements.
 
 While ESG encompasses a vast body of topics, this class will draw examples and discuss about a diverse set of issues ESG, including carbon emissions, employees pay, employees labor-safety, and the role of consumers’ NGO, based on short examples or cases spanning different firms in different industries (e.g., wholesale, aviation) and different countries (e.g., USA, France, Japan).
 This half-term course is composed of a mix of lectures, cases and online or in-person interventions by high profile industry guest speakers. The lectures are motivated by (1) rigorous recent academic studies drawing from the accounting literature, but also borrowing from adjacent fields including economics, finance, law and strategy and (2) practitioners notes and examples.
 
 Who should take this course?
 
 Students should take this course if they are interested in ESG in general and/or if they expect to use disclosure of non-financial information in their career. This is particularly relevant for students who want to pursue careers in finance (e.g., investment banking) where firms’ ESG footprint is becoming a scrutinized factor in M&A or investment decisions in general, as well as students going to careers in consulting where corporate decisions will more and more be benchmark against their ESG implications.

ACCT B8122,Accounting for Consultants,"This elective course covers accounting tools useful to consultants, as well as for students with an interest in a firm’s finance function, general management, or private equity.
There will be a particular focus on performance measurement and management.
Performance measurement is a key determinant of success for today’s companies that sell a wide range of products and services to a wide range of customers differentiated in their needs. While financial accounting (GAAP) information is a useful shortcut toward gaining some understanding of a firm’s financial health, consultants and managers need a more solid understanding of the firm’s strategy and mission, as well as disaggregated information that helps assess how the firm is performing along its strategic objectives.
There is overlap between this course and the half-semester course “Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)” course. This course expands on many of the concepts taught in FP&A and supplements them with industry insights and guest speakers. For this reason, this course is mutually exclusive with the elective course “B8007 – Financial Planning & Analysis”. If you have taken FP&A, you will not be able to enroll in this course for credit.  Please contact me immediately in case of such a conflict.
The following specific topics will be addressed:
• Profitability analysis to assess individual products
• Customer relationship management using customer lifetime value (CLV)
• Budgeting and variances
• Performance evaluation for profit centers and investment centers
• Performance-based pay: team incentives, relative performance evaluation, etc.
• Corporate governance: the C-suite and the role of compensation consultants
• The “War of Metrics”: Cash Flow, EVA, Balanced Scorecards, etc.
• Innovative ways to deviate from GAAP rules to better measure value creation
• Issues specific to multinational enterprises (MNEs), e.g., taxation
• Industry-specific insights: performance measurement in key industries",Tim Baldenius,9:00am,12:15pm,14669,,B8122-20261-001,Accounting for Consultant,Accounting (ACCT),ACCT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ACCT/B8122-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,B8007,MW,20261ACCT8122B001,LECTURE

AFAS UN1003,Blackness and Frenchness: A Radical Gene,"How have Black radicals embraced the French language and, at times, Frenchness without espousing France’s dominance and its doctrines of assimilation? This course explores the watershed moments from the past three centuries that redefine the articulations of blackness in French, in France and beyond—from revolutionary or constitutional independence in the post-colony to recent social movements in continental Europe. In addition to the opening inquiry, guiding questions for this course include but are not limited to the following. What kinds of state-sanctioned backlash in France have ensued in the face of affirmative reclamations of blackness (e.g. Négritude and Afroféminisme)?  And, what are the historical linkages between Black radicalism in France and the United States? Through an intra-imperial and inter-imperial lens, this course will center contributions from Black writers, artists, and intellectuals of divergent colonial histories with especial consideration to those for whom French and France is their native language and land.",Veronique Charles,12:10pm,2:00pm,10536,,W1003-20261-001,Blackness and Frenchness,African American and African Diaspora,AFAS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFAS/W1003-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20261AFAS1003W001,SEMINAR

This course invites participants to engage critically with Shange's essays and personal writings while delving into her archive.
  
Students will identify key themes and literary techniques in Shange's nonfiction and the historical and cultural context in which she wrote these works. We will examine how Shange's nonfiction contributes to her broader work and her perspectives on history, gender, feminism, and race as they intersect in her life as a Black woman artist. Students will develop critical thinking skills through close reading, analysis, and discussion of Shange's nonfiction and will improve their writing skills by composing reflections and essays on Shange's works.

AFAS UN3004,Introduction to Black Geographies,"This course will introduce students to 
Black geographies
 as a spatial expression of Black studies. Black scholars have long recognized the complex spatialities of Black life, developing theories of diaspora, racial capitalism, and anti-/post-colonialism that are inherently geographical. In this course, we will think about space, place, landscape, and ecology through a Black geographic framework, paying attention to how scholars, activists, and artists engage the poetics and materiality of Black life to explore ideas about repair, inequality, resistance, and liberation. The questions that animate this course are: what are Black geographies? What is the future of Black geographies outside of academia? How can centering a “Black sense of place” in turn transform the way we think about space, place, and power? How does Black Studies account for and understand Black spatial condition, experience, and imaginaries?
  
The course will begin with an engagement of key works on Black geographies. We will come to see institutional Black geographies as concerned with the Black spatial imaginaries formed in the aftermath of enslavement and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. As such, our readings will center experiences in the United States. We will cover such topics as Black method(s), racial capitalism, regional geographies, carceral geographies, and Black home and infrastructure.
  
Ultimately, students will be introduced to central themes, concepts and approaches that highlight the spatialization of race and the racialization of space through various technologies that signify places according to new rules of inclusion and exclusion. In this way, we will examine historical and contemporary macro-community and micro- sub-community (e.g., neighborhood) issues shaping the social, economic and political lives of Black people.",Brandi Summers,2:10pm,4:00pm,10496,,W3004-20261-001,Introto Black  Geographie,African American and African Diaspora,AFAS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFAS/W3004-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20261AFAS3004W001,SEMINAR

AFEN BC3135,Zora Neale Hurston: A Writing Life,"On her “Record of Freshman Interest” form, Zora Neale Hurston, Barnard class of 1928, wrote in response to the question of what vocation or profession she had in mind after graduation, “I have had some small success as a writer and wish above all to succeed at it. Either teaching or social work would be interesting, but consolation prizes.”  No consolation prize was necessary as Hurston became one of American and African American literature’s finest writers, America’s first Black anthropologist, and a Black feminist ancestor and icon. A deep dive into Hurston’s work and writing life, this course reads Hurston as a narrative stylist and theorist in multiple genres: as poet, essayist, writer of short stories, novelist, playright, folklorist, and autobiographer. The goal of this class is to read Hurston closely and widely and to identify and examine her aesthetic philosophy and stylistic choices as one of the first African American women able to have a writing “career.”
  
 
  
In Spring of 2026, this class will center the cultural context in which Hurston wrote, using the New York Historical’s exhibition 
Gay Harlem Renaissance
.  Hurston was an active part of a coterie of artists and intellectuals who made up the “queer mentorship and gay-inclusive salons and friendship circles that helped sustain the Harlem Renaissance.” We will also partner with the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard, as well as Barnard Archives, in the preparation of final digital projects that can be shared with the college community.",Monica L Miller,2:10pm,4:00pm,00606,,X3135-20261-001,Zora Neale Hurston: A Wri,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFEN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFEN/X3135-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261AFEN3135X001,SEMINAR

Exploring the cultural contexts and aesthetic debates that animated Harlem in 1920s to 1930s, the course discusses the politics of literary and theatrical production, while exploring the fashioning and performance of New Negro identity through fiction, poetry, essays, and artwork.  Topics considered include: role of Africa/slavery/the south in New Negro expression, patronage, passing, primitivism/popular culture, black dialect as literary language, and the problematics of creating a “racial” art in/for a community comprised of differences in gender, class, sexuality, and geographical origin.",Maleda Belilgne,6:10pm,7:25pm,00605,,X3196-20261-001,HARLEM RENAISSANCE LITERA,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFEN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFEN/X3196-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20261AFEN3196X001,SEMINAR

Othello 
will be a focal point. However, this course will examine other “race” plays as well as works perceived as “race-neutral” in tandem with Black “respeakings” of Shakespeare’s works. This class is antiracist in intent and is shaped by several interlocking questions: What is Black Shakespeare? Can creators and scholars separate Shakespeare from the apparatus of white supremacy that has been built around his works? What are the challenges for BIPOC actors performing Shakespeare on the dominant stage? What are the challenges and obstacles for BIPOC scholars working on Shakespeare in academia?

AFRS BC3565,Apollo: History & Culture in Harlem,"Harlem is a community with a long and storied legacy of arts and entertainment that dates back to the late 1800s. Its legacy extends through the many cultural movements that have helped to define the community such as the Harlem Renaissance in the early 1900s, the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, and Hip Hop in the 1970s and 1980s, to the current renaissance of venues that anchor Harlem as a neighborhood vibrant with varied opportunities for cultural engagement. Harlem is home to several historic and iconic venues devoted to the arts and entertainment such as the Apollo Theater, Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the National Black Theatre. These and many other venues along with many others throughout the neighborhood have helped to anchor Harlem as a beacon for Black creative expression that has been instrumental in shaping American culture. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, part of the New York Public Library, stands as a repository for much of this history and as an emblem of Harlem’s extensive cultural history. In recent years, Harlem has also seen a burgeoning of new galleries, performance spaces, and cultural events that have reignited and brought new audiences to the community. In this course, we will explore Harlem’s early history and how it evolved from a place known primarily for its entertainment venues to one with a mix of standard and more cutting edge artistic and cultural ventures. Community, politics, and economics will also be considered as we look at various cultural and artistic movements. As part of our exploration, we will examine whether shifts in demographics and the ideas, notions, and sometimes, myths about the neighborhood have influenced arts and entertainment in the community. We will seek to define what distinguishes arts and entertainment in Harlem from other New York City neighborhoods and how Harlem has contributed over the years to Black arts and entertainment in NYC and beyond. This course will include visits to venues and visits from guest speakers, all relative to in-class discussions and deeper exploration of the space arts and entertainment have continued to hold for the community and for the people of Harlem. Along with guided walking tours, visits to selected venues will help to delineate Harlem’s cultural past and its continuing evolution through the work of artists, curators, administrators, scholars, culture bearers, and others.

We will analyze these two tendencies in the distinct social, political, and economic contexts of their emergence in various “centers” of the continent paying special attention to the ideologies of modernization, progress, and economic development; political upheavals including violent dictatorships and other crises; artists’ relationship to Western European and U.S. cultural centers, and transnational circulation networks; and the role of art institutions. To this end, we will pay special attention to how these trends have been historicized to date, and to what ends. The second half of the class will examine practices since the mid-1970s to the present in a comparative perspective: one, through the lens of identity politics and, two, analyzing the dynamics of the increased global dissemination of works from Latin America and by Latin-American descendants.

It examines the ways that media artists question public participation, democratic commitment, and collective memory. During the 1960s in the United States and abroad, the promise of networked communication prompted a consideration of global connectivity that brought artists and artworks outside of the gallery into the public sphere. Artist, often activists, explored the dissemination of information, and they commandeered messaging. Many of these artists positioned their output against mainstream media, while other artists seized existing media streams with the aim, optimistically, to alter them. Case studies include Stan VanDerBeek, Dara Birnbaum, Black Audio Collective, Tiffany Sia, Sondra Perry, and CAMP.  This course brings together seminar discussions, the practice of making, and the hosting of practitioners; it is designed to offer students an introduction to various aspects of media as it is crafted and curated within and without museum environments.",Janina P Marshall,12:10pm,2:00pm,00069,,X3864-20261-001,"Signals: Networks, Public",Art History @Barnard,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/X3864-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261AHIS3864X001,SEMINAR

We will examine the impact of and response to natural disasters and war. We will discuss the emergence of so-called “new town” suburban developments since the 1960s and the ways in which these new urban forms reshaped daily life. We will discuss the bucolic prints of the 1910s through the 1930s that obscured the crowding, pollution and political violence and compare them with the more politically engaged prints and journalistic photographs of the era.

The result of this restless exploration is the invention of multiple formal languages, which need to be deciphered in spite of the perverse literature on the subject which insists on transposing this into the art-historical language of iconography. The literature is rich with the analytic struggles between the great Picasso scholars: William Rubin, Leo Steinberg, and Picasso’s biographer, John Russel. The skirmishes over the “iconography” of cubism extends to the interpretation of the work’s relation to “primitivism.” This controversy has given rise to yet a new vector on Picasso’s work: structuralism and semiotics.",Rosalind Krauss,2:10pm,4:00pm,13787,,G6413-20261-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G6413-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,W,20261AHIS6413G001,LECTURE

Ion
 and 
The Republic
 and we will turn next to Aristotle’s defense of art in the 
Poetics
. The course will go on to discuss writings on aesthetics by thinkers such as Aquinas, Vasari, and Bellori. We will then devote considerable attention to eighteenth-century contributions to the history of aesthetics and art criticism, as it was in this period that the term “aesthetics” was first coined and that the “philosophy of art” was invented.

AHIS GR8496,Art History and the Archive,"This graduate seminar explores the role of archives and “the archive” in the history and making of art history. How has the discipline defined its archives in the past, and how is it doing so now? How does one identify, navigate, and mine repositories of information for the purpose of art historical study? And what challenges or problems—theoretical, methodological, ethical—does such work raise? Our investigation will be grounded in and guided by readings drawn from a range of fields, including history, anthropology, critical theory, and queer, feminist, postcolonial, Indigenous, and critical race studies. Over the course of the semester, seminar members will also design and undertake an independent research project using one or more archives in the New York City area.",Meredith Gamer,,,13790,,G8496-20261-001,Art History and the Archi,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8496-20261-001/,,In-Person,,4,,,20261AHIS8496G001,SEMINAR
AHIS GU4023,"Medieval Art II: Castles, Cathedral, and","This advanced lecture course is intended for students with little or no background in medieval art of Latin (“Western”) Europe. It provides a comprehensive introduction to a period spanning roughly one millennium, from Pope Gregory the Great’s defense of art ca. 600 to rising antagonism against it on the eve of the Protestant Reformation. Themes under consideration include Christianity and colonialism, pilgrimage and the cult of saints, archaism versus Gothic modernism, the drama of the liturgy, somatic and affective piety, political ideology against “others,” the development of the winged altarpiece, and pre-Reformation iconophobia. We will survey many aspects of artistic production, from illuminated manuscripts, portable and monumental sculpture, stained glass, sumptuous metalworks, drawings, and reliquaries to the earliest examples of oil paintings and prints. While this course is conceived as a pendant to Medieval Art I: From Late Antiquity to the End of the Byzantine Empire (AHIS GU4021), each can be taken independently of one another. In addition to section meetings, museum visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Cloisters, and The Morgan Library are a required component to the course.

AHIS GU4741,Art and Theory in a Global Context,"What is “globalization”? How does it change the way we think about or show art today? What role does film and media play in it? How has critical theory itself assumed new forms in this configuration moving outside post-war Europe and America? How have these processes helped change with the very idea of ‘contemporary art’? What then might a transnational critical theory in art and in thinking look like today or in the 21st century? In this course we will examine this cluster of questions from a number of different angles, starting with new questions about borders, displacements, translations and minorities, and the ways they have cut across and figured in different regions, in Europe or America, as elsewhere. In the course of our investigations, we will look in particular at two areas in which these questions are being raised today -- in Asia and in Africa and its diasporas. The course is thus inter-disciplinary in nature and is open to students in different fields and areas where these issues are now being discussed.",John Rajchman,4:10pm,6:00pm,13782,,W4741-20261-001,Art & Theory in Global Co,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W4741-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20261AHIS4741W001,SEMINAR

Employing a variety of analytical approaches, it addresses issues related to the Renaissance built environment thematically and through a series of specific case studies. Travelling across a geographically diverse array of locales, we will interrogate the cultural, material, urban, social, and political dimensions of architecture (civic, commercial, industrial, domestic, ecclesiastical and otherwise). Additional topics to be discussed include: antiquity and its reinterpretation; local identity, style, and ornament; development of building typologies; patronage and politics; technology and building practice; religious change and advancements in warfare; the creation and migration of architectural knowledge; role of capitalism and colonialism; class and decorum in domestic design; health and the city; the mobility of people and materials; architectural theory, books, and the culture of print; the media of architectural practice; the growth of cities and towns; the creation of urban space and landscape; architectural responses to ecological and environmental factors; and the changing status of the architect.

AHIS UN2400,Nineteenth-Century Art in Europe,"How do you represent a revolution? What does it mean to picture the world as it “really” is? Who may be figured as a subject or citizen, and who not? Should art improve society, or critique it? Can it do both? These are some of the many questions that the artists of nineteenth-century Europe grappled with, and that we will explore together in this course. This was an era of rapid and dramatic political, economic, and cultural change, marked by wars at home and colonial expansion abroad; the rise of industrialization and urbanization; and the invention of myriad new technologies, from photography to the railway. The arts played an integral and complex role in all of these developments: they both shaped and were shaped by them. Lectures will address a variety media, from painting and sculpture to the graphic and decorative arts, across a range of geographic contexts, from Paris, London, Berlin, and Madrid to St. Petersburg, Cairo, Haiti, and New Zealand.

AMST BC4984,Black Solidarities,"This seminar invites junior‐ and senior‐year scholars to interrogate solidarity and coalition through the lenses of Black studies, archival practice, and intersectional politics. Liberation is not a zero‐sum game. Black solidarities are both a theoretical framework and a tactical archive. Black Solidarities disrupts the idea of a Black monolith, i.e. there is no singular ""Black community"" or ""Black experience."" This course pushes us to mine the fissures in Black experience for the differences emerging from intersectional experiences of liberatory thought, politics, and social realities. We will explore the meaning of solidarity and coalition as sociological and historical phenomena. Through close readings, multimedia interviews, podcasts, and original research, students will:
  
- Define and critique the sociological concepts of solidarity, coalition, and allyship in contemporary U.S. and global contexts.
 - Explore the tensions and possibilities of extending Black‐centered analysis to other struggles (Indigenous, Palestinian, disability, climate justice, etc.) without diluting the centrality of anti‐Blackness.

AMST GU4529,The Science of Sex,"What is good sex? What, even, is sex? Who should be having it with whom, and when? Why does sex hurt sometimes? Why does it feel incredible, when it does? What makes sex healthy? Normal? Who says? How do they know? Why?
  
Across the past hundred and fifty years, time doctors, biologists, psychologists, feminists, phrenologists, and LGBTQ activists have spent lifetimes struggling over the answers to these questions and more. In this class, we will explore the growth and development of the field of sexology, its vast impact on U.S. and German life and its imbrications with structures of oppression and visions of (often imperfect) liberation. To do so, we will read a range of both primary and secondary sources from a variety of different schools and perspectives.
  
The attempt to scientifically study and define sex fundamentally reshaped both sex and science. It changed how everyday people lived their lives and helping give birth to new scientific disciplines. It also helped produce and police idea of normal, healthy sex, and provided evolutionary justifications for heterosexuality and patriarchy. The activist response – both in and outside of the field of sexology – helped build the modern feminist and LGBTQ movements and reshaped how everyday people made sex of sex, gender, and sexuality. Even if deeply flawed, sexology was also widely contentious, with major scholars having their books burned and banned in both the United States and Germany.",Dani Joslyn,11:00am,12:50pm,00936,,W4529-20261-001,,American Studies @Barnard,AMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AMST/W4529-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261AMST4529W001,SEMINAR

ANTH BC2012,LAB METHODS ARCHAEOLOGY,"Only the most recent chapters of the past are able to be studied using traditional historiographical methods focused on archives of textual documents. How, then, are we to analyze the deep history of human experiences prior to the written word? And even when textual archives do survive from a given historical period, these archives are typically biased toward the perspectives of those in power. How, then, are we to undertake analyses of the past that take into account the lives and experiences of all of society’s members, including the poor, the working class, the colonized, and others whose voices appear far less frequently in historical documents? From its disciplinary origins in nineteenth century antiquarianism, archaeology has grown to become a rigorous science of the past, dedicated to the exploration of long-term and inclusive social histories.
  
“Laboratory Methods in Archaeology” is an intensive introduction to the analysis of archaeological artifacts and samples in which we explore how the organic and inorganic remains from archaeological sites can be used to build rigorous claims about the human past. The 2022 iteration of the course centers on assemblages from two sites, both excavated by Barnard’s archaeological field program in the Taos region of northern New Mexico: (1) the Spanish colonial site of San Antonio del Embudo founded in 1725 and (2) the hippie commune known as New Buffalo, founded in 1967. Participants in ANTH BC2012 will be introduced to the history, geology, and ecology of the Taos region, as well as to the excavation histories of the two sites. Specialized laboratory modules focus on the analysis of chipped stone artifacts ceramics, animal bone, glass, and industrial artifacts.
  
The course only demands participation in the seminars and laboratory modules and successful completion of the written assignments, but all students are encouraged to develop specialized research projects to be subsequently expanded into either (1) a senior thesis project or (2) a conference presentation at the Society for American Archaeology, Society for Historical Archaeology, or Theoretical Archaeology Group meeting.",Severin Fowles,4:10pm,6:00pm,00672,,X2012-20261-001,,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X2012-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,ANTH BC2012,T,20261ANTH2012X001,LECTURE

In particular we will work to understand the historic, economic, political, and socio-cultural forces that created the conditions we call climate change. With this we will take a particular interest in the question of how race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, and gender articulate with the material effects of climate change. The course also focuses on how we, as scholars, citizens, and activists can work to alter these current conditions in ways that foster social and ecological justice for all living beings. Although we will ground our scholarship in anthropology, to encourage interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary thought, weekly readings will be drawn from across scholarly and activist canons. While becoming familiar with scholarly and activist conversations about space and place, risk and vulnerability, and ontology and epistemology, we will work through a series of recent events as case studies to understand causes, effects, affects, and potential solutions.",Paige West,1:10pm,2:25pm,00410,,X2427-20261-001,ANTHROPOLOGY OF CLIMATE C,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X2427-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261ANTH2427X001,LECTURE
ANTH BC3223,Gender Archaeolxgy,"This seminar critically reexamines the ancient world from the perspective of gender archaeology. Though the seedlings of gender archaeology were first sown by of feminist archaeologists during the 70’s and 80’s, this approach involves far more than simply ‘womanizing’ androcentric narratives of past. Rather, gender archaeology criticizes interpretations of the past that transplant contemporary social roles onto the archaeological past, casting the divisions and inequalities of today as both timeless and natural. This class challenges the idea of a singular past, instead championing a turn towards multiple, rich, messy, intersectional pasts. The ‘x’ in ‘archaeolxgy’ is an explicit signal of our focus on this diversity of pasts and a call for a more inclusive field of practice today.",Camilla Sturm,10:10am,12:00pm,00412,,X3223-20261-001,GENDER ARCHAEOLXGY,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X3223-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261ANTH3223X001,SEMINAR

ANTH BC3243,"Sin, Disease, Subversion and the Experie","Course Description This course provides an exploration of how race and racism are produced, reproduced, and resisted from a Latin American perspective. We will examine a conception of race that is often ambiguous, hybrid, and fluid, yet coexists with deeply entrenched forms of racism. We begin by tracing the origins of racial formations to the colonial period, focusing on how race and religion became intertwined. The course then investigates Latin America's role in the medicalization of racialized bodies, particularly in the context of nation-building projects. We will analyze how racism has operated during periods of political violence, authoritarian rule, and transitions to democracy. Given the region's vast heterogeneity, we will critically examine ""Latin America"" as a category and use representative case studies to explore how race is mediated through signifiers such as education, gender, geography, occupation, dress, language, and religion—while ultimately being inscribed on and through the body. Students will explore Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies, and reflect on how the legacies of colonial and state violence persist but are contested. The first half of this course provides an overview of historical events and theoretical debates around the study of race in Latin America. The second half is dedicated to reading ethnographic work on questions of race. The selected books present cases in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and of immigrants in the United States.",,10:10am,12:00pm,00892,,X3243-20261-001,Race in Latin America,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X3243-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261ANTH3243X001,SEMINAR

Archaeologists argue over whether there is such a thing as a stand-alone ‘archaeological theory’ and what kinds of theory from other disciplines should (or should not!) be imported. This course explores a range of recent theoretical conversations, orientations, and interventions within archaeology, with an eye to understanding what is currently at stake – and what is contested – in how archaeologists think about making archaeological knowledge in the contemporary moment. In doing so, this course encourages students to think about theory in archaeology as an important form of “practical knowledge” or “know how” for archaeologists (cf.

ANTH GR6227,Ethnographies at the End of the World,"What can we learn from anthropological and ethnographic research in and about a damaged world, a world confronted by the violence and effects of war, climate change, transnational migration, post-industrial abandonment, and the lives and afterlives of colonialism and slavery? What are the ethnographic debates that address the catastrophes produced by capitalism and the lifeforms that emerge out of its ruins? What types of anthropological critique emerge in times enunciated as ‘the end of the world’? And what comes after this end? Ethnographies at the End of the World addresses these questions by paying close attention to some of the most relevant debates in contemporary anthropological theory and anthropological critique. These debates include, among others, discussions on violence and trauma, the politics of life and death, the work of memory and oblivion, and the material entanglements between human and non-human forms of existence. The aim of this seminar is to generate a discussion around the multiple implications of these theoretical arrangements and how anthropologists deploy them in their ethnographic understandings of the world we live in. In doing so, this course provides students with a fundamental understanding and conceptual knowledge about how anthropologists use and produce theory, and how this theoretical production is mobilized as a social critique. This course is reading intensive and operates in the form of a seminar.

ANTH GR6293,SPECTERS OF ORGANIZED SUBVERSION,"Ruling powers of various shapes and sizes tend to prosecute those people whom they fear because of their identity, class, craft, or convictions. Often, the object of accusation, inquiry, prosecution, and persecution includes not just one (or more) individual persons, but a set of relationships that these ruling powers see as anathema to the social order they seek to establish or maintain, and on which their power depends. Specters can personify residuals of antediluvian political or cosmological order (heretics and witches, officers of toppled regime, Catholics after the reformation, idolatry trials in the new world, mafiosi after their criminalization, Bundists in Soviet Russia) or emergent forms (emancipated Jews, dissidents, or anarchists). All share that role in social dramas that cast them as enemies of The State, The Church, The People, or Humanity. In this seminar we will begin to explore the array of social rituals, routinized practices (like rumors and media-oriented lynching) and institutions that have been developed specifically in order to name such specters and summon them publicly. We will examine, among others: trials, conspiracy theories (as a mode of recounting a presence that is constantly putting the specter back in), investigative committees, inquisitorial tribunals. We will examine how such social rituals and routinized practices and institutions give us unique opportunities to examine what conceptions of society, of relationships good and evil, and of justice underlie political orders, how they codify and pursue them, and what historical processes these enactments trigger or shape. We’ll focus on cases from early modern and modern societies, with an eye towards the emergence and stabilization of republican order.",Naor H Ben-Yehoyada,2:10pm,4:00pm,11480,,G6293-20261-001,SPECTERS OF ORGANIZED SUB,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G6293-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,M,20261ANTH6293G001,SEMINAR

Through the study of museum exhibitions, this course explores a series of debates about the representation of culture in museums, the politics of identity, and the significance of objects. We will consider the museum as a contemporary and variable form, as a site for the expression of national, group, and individual identity and as a site of performance and consumption. We will consider how exhibits are developed, what they aim to convey, what makes them effective (or not), and how they sometimes become flashpoints of controversy. Because the work of museums is visual, enacted through the display of material forms, we will also consider the transformation of objects into artifacts and as part of exhibitions, addressing questions of meaning, ownership, value, and magic.

ANTH UN3604,As If: Anthropologies of the Future,"This seminar engages--through science fiction and speculative fiction, film, and companion readings in anthropology and beyond—a range of approaches to the notion of the “future” and to the imagination of multiple futures to come.  We will work through virtual and fictive constructions of future worlds, ecologies, and social orders “as If” they present alternative possibilites for pragmatic yet utopian thinking and dreaming in the present (and as we’ll also consider dystopian and “heterotopian” possibilities as well).",Marilyn Ivy,4:10pm,6:00pm,11301,,W3604-20261-001,As If: Anthropologies of,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3604-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

ANTH UN3663,The Ancient Table: Archaeology of Cookin,"Prerequisites: None Humans don’t just eat to live. The ways we prepare, eat, and share our food is a complex reflection of our histories, environments, and ideologies. Whether we prefer coffee or tea, cornbread or challah, chicken breast or chicken feet, our tastes are expressive of social ties and social boundaries, and are linked to ideas of family and of foreignness. How did eating become such a profoundly cultural experience? This seminar takes an archaeological approach to two broad issues central to eating: First, what drives human food choices both today and in the past? Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies. Topics that will be covered include the nature of the first cooking, beer-brewing and feasting, writing of the early recipes, gender roles and ‘domestic’ life, and how a national cuisine takes shape. Through the course of the semester we will explore food practices from Pleistocene Spain to historic Monticello, with particular emphasis on the earliest cuisines of China, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean.",Camilla Sturm,12:10pm,2:00pm,00674,,W3663-20261-001,ANCT TBL: ARCH COOKING &,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3663-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261ANTH3663W001,SEMINAR
ANTH UN3665,The Politics of Care,"Semester:
  
What are the consequences of entrenched inequalities in the context of care? How might we (re)imagine associated practices as political projects? Wherein lie the origins of utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? How might we track associated promises and failures as they travel across social hierarchies, nationalities, and geographies of care? And what do we mean when we speak of “care”? These questions define the scaffolding for this course. Our primary goals throughout this semester are threefold.  First, we begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. Second, we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, including urban and rural America, an Amazonia borderland, South Africa, France, and Mexico. Third, we will address temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced in the here-and-now, historically, and in a futuristic world of science fiction. Finally, and most importantly, we will remain alert to the relevance of domains of difference relevant to care, most notably race, gender, class, and species.

Summer:
  
What do we mean when we speak of “care”? How might we (re)imagine practices of care as political and moral projects? What promises, paradoxes, or failures surface amid entrenched inequalities? And what hopes, desires, and fears inform associated utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? These questions will serve as a scaffolding of sorts for this course, and our primary goals are fourfold. 
First,
 we will begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. 
Second,
 we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, communities, and geographies of care. 
Third
, we will remain alert to the temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced historically, in the here-and-now, and in the futuristic world of science fiction. 
Finally,
 we will consider the moral underpinnings of intra-human alongside interspecies care.

ANTH UN3811,TOXIC,"It is no secret by now that we live in a toxic sea. Every day, in every place in this world, we are exposed to an unknown number of contaminants, including those in the places that we live, the air that we breathe, the foods that we eat, the water that we drink, the consumer products that we use, and in the social worlds that we navigate. While we are all exposed, the effects of these exposures are distributed in radically unequal patterns, and histories of racialization, coloniality, and gendered inequality are critical determinants of the risks to wellness that these toxic entanglements entail. Scientists use the term body burden to describe the accumulated, enduring amounts of harmful substances present in human bodies. In this course, we explore the global conditions that give rise to local body burdens, plumbing the history of toxicity as a category, the politics of toxic exposures, and the experience of toxic embodiment. Foregrounding uneven exposures and disproportionate effects, we ask how scientists and humanists, poets and political activists, have understood toxicity as a material and social phenomenon. We will turn our collective attention to the analysis of ethnographies, memoirs, maps, film, and photography, and students will also be charged with creating visual and narrative projects for representing body burden of their own.",Vanessa L Agard-Jones,12:10pm,2:00pm,12316,,V3811-20261-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3811-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

The course focuses on a set of themes and questions: for example, the nature of violence and the question of responsibility or accountability, shifting technologies of warfare, and the phenomenology and aftermath of warfare, for civilians and for combatants.

Silence, noise, voice, chambers, reverberation, sound in its myriad manifestations and transmissions.  From the captured souls of Edison’s phonography, to everyday acoustical adventures, the course turns away from the screen and dominant epistemologies of the visual for an extended moment, and does so in pursuit of sonorous objects.  How is it that sound so moves us as we move within its world, and who or what then might the listening subject be?",John Pemberton,2:10pm,4:00pm,10499,,V3880-20261-001,LISTENING: AN ETHNOG OF SOUND,Anthropology,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3880-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

This course pursues interconnections linking text and performance in light of magic, ritual, possession, narration, and related articulations of power. Readings are drawn from classic theoretical writings, colonial fiction, and ethnographic accounts. Domains of inquiry include: spirit possession, trance states, séance, ritual performance, and related realms of cinematic projection, musical form, shadow theater, performative objects, and (other) things that move on their own, compellingly. Key theoretical concerns are subjectivity - particularly, the conjuring up and displacement of self in the form of the first-person singular I - and the haunting power of repetition.

ANTH UN3999,SENIOR THESIS SEM IN ANTHROPOL,"Prerequisites: The instructors permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages). The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis/ capstone project.

ARCH GU4300,The Just City: Global Debates in Urban P,"Urbanization is inherently unequal, inscribing social, economic, environmental, and political unevenness into the spatial fabric of the city. But the distribution of such inequality is not inevitable. Urbanization is a product of the collective decisions we make (or choose not to make) in response to the shared challenges we face in our cities. And, thus, the patterns of urbanization can be changed. This is the task of urban planning and the starting point for this advanced seminar, which asks how we can reshape our cities to be more just—to alleviate inequality rather than compound it. In embarking on this effort, we face numerous “wicked” problems without clear-cut solutions. The approaches one takes in addressing urban inequality are therefore fundamentally normative—they are shaped by one’s place in the world and one’s view of it. The central challenge in addressing inequality is thus establishing a basis for collective action amongst diverse actors with differing—and sometimes conflicting—values and views. In other words, planning the just city a matter of both empathy and debate. In this course, we will endeavor to develop informed positions that can help us engage with others as a basis for taking collective action.
  
The course is organized into four 3-week modules, each of which addresses a dimension of the just city: equity, democracy, diversity, and sustainability. In the first week of each module, we will discuss how the issue has been understood in history and theory (with an emphasis on tradeoffs between different priorities and values); in the second week, we will apply this discussion to a global case study prepared and presented by a team of students; and in the third week, we will hold an in-class debate to determine what should be done. Specific case studies vary each year.",Nick R Smith,2:10pm,4:00pm,00641,,W4300-20261-001,THE JUST CITY,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W4300-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20261ARCH4300W001,SEMINAR

ARCH UN1005,MAKE LAB,"Make Lab is for makers and the maker-curious. It is designed for all students, studying across all ﬁelds of inquiry. It is for everyone who wants to explore, experiment, and think through making. You may already be a maker and want to expand your familiarity with new tools and techniques. Or you may not have had the time or opportunity to work with a broad range of tools and materials – this course is also for those who are curious about making and design. For all, it provides a foundation to fully engage in making and to learn about the design process through your participation in workshops and directed experimentation in the Design Center.  
  
Utilizing the existing introductory workshops offered in the Design Center, you will be asked to expand your knowledge of different tools and technologies by attending a range of workshops over the course of the semester. The ﬁnal deliverable will be a dossier (small portfolio or collection of images and text) that documents your work in the workshops as well as your design process and work from an independent project that expands on one or more techniques/tools you’ve worked with over the semester. Additional work includes a short reading response during the ﬁrst week and a case study presentation of the design work of a “maker” who inspires you.",Marina Correia,,,00834,,W1005-20261-001,,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W1005-20261-001/,,,,1,,,20261ARCH1005W001,LABORATORY

Both designed objects and the very act of making are always embedded within a culture, as they reflect changing material preferences, diverse approaches to durability and obsolescence, varied understandings of comfort, different concerns with economy and ecology. They depend on multiple resources and mobilize varied technological innovations. Consequently, we will consider that making always involves making a society, for it constitutes a response to its values and a position regarding its technical and material resources. Within this understanding, this studio will consider different cultures of making through a number of exercises rehearse design operations at different scales—from objects to infrastructures.",Michael E Schissel,9:00am,11:50am,00585,,V2101-20261-001,ARCH DESIGN: SYSTMS & MTR,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/V2101-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4.5,,MW,20261ARCH2101V001,STUDIO

ARCH UN3117,MOD ARCHITECTURE IN THE WORLD,"Prerequisites: Designed for but not limited to sophomores; enrollment beyond 60 at the discretion of the instructor. 
  
Modern Architecture in the World is an introduction to different arenas in which architecture’s modern condition has been disputed in the last two centuries across different geographies. The course will address significant transformations in the built environment as well as the forms of practice, epistemic frameworks, and ideologies that led them. It will also attend to the forms of labor and economies that engendered new structures and organizations of space, the material resources and industries mobilized in their construction, the identities and forms of power they represented and imposed, the manifold embodiments that they hosted and shaped, the diverse socialites and politics they supported, and the ecologies they negotiated.
  
The course is organized around a number of key themes, with each class covering episodes spanning the whole period under consideration, up until the present. In this way, it will question the existence of a single line of development, a master narrative, or a teleological line of progress and will highlight instead the multiple, simultaneous, conflicting, and branching genealogies unfolding throughout the period. Students will gain knowledge of key buildings, artifacts, trends, and schools as they relate to those genealogies.
  
Each lecture will emphasize contending and shifting positions across geographies within the arenas explored, understanding hegemonic trends as well as dissenting positions. While different locations around the world will be highlighted in each class, the course positions modern architecture in the world by privileging an exploration of the cultural and material networks and hierarchies characteristic of the period—with attention to colonialism, coloniality, migration, resource extraction, and war, among others.",Anooradha I Siddiqi,1:10pm,2:25pm,00588,,W3117-20261-001,MOD ARCHITECTURE IN THE W,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W3117-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,MW,20261ARCH3117W001,LECTURE
ARCH UN3120,"CITY,LANDSCAPE, & ECOLOGY","City, Landscape, Ecology 
is a thematically driven course that centers on issues and polemics related to landscape, land settlement and ecology over the past two centuries. The class looks at changing attitudes to the natural world from the eighteenth century to the present, tracing important historical shifts in the consideration of nature across the ecological sciences, conservation practices, landscape design, and environmental activism, law and policy. Lectures focus on the critical role that artists and architects have played, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental degradation and in developing new means of mitigating anthropogenic ecological change.
  
City, Landscape, Ecology 
is divided into three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of 
landscape
: picturesque garden theory, notions of “wilderness” as epitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern and Postmodern garden practices, and place of landscape in the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose here is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays in the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and technologies of power. Lectures in this part are shaped around a dialectical pair of historical episodes–– for example, the picturesque garden is paired with the enclosure of the commons, and American national parks are discussed in relation to the systematic removal of native peoples.
  
We then turn to 
ecology
 and related issues of climate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look at the rise of ecological thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the environment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of the era. In the session “Capitalism, Race and Population Growth” we examine the history of the “crisis” of scarcity from Thomas Robert Malthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (
The Population Bomb
, 1968) to today and look at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity. 
  
The course concludes with Part III on 
Environmental Repair
. At this important juncture in the course, we will ask what is to be done today. We’ll examine the work of contemporary theorists, architects, landscape architects, policy makers and environmentalists who have channeled some of the lessons",Ralph Ghoche,4:10pm,5:25pm,00639,,V3120-20261-001,,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/V3120-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261ARCH3120V001,LECTURE

Our emphasis will be on primary texts from each tradition, with introductory and interpretive secondary sources brought in as supplementary.  These primary sources will be discussed in class, but especially in required section meetings.  A sub-theme of the course is the “pastoral” dimension of answers to the Problem of Evil: to what extent are the answers we study comforting?  This course has been created with the many crises presently afflicting our world – COVID-19, climate change, and the injustice of racism, to name a few – in mind.",Rachel McDermott,10:10am,11:25am,00405,,X3115-20261-001,WHY BAD THINGS GOOD PEOPL,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,ASRL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ASRL/X3115-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261ASRL3115X001,LECTURE

BIET PS5320,INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHICAL BIOETHICS,"In contemporary bioethics, we find ourselves grappling with practically important, and at the same time, philosophically fundamental questions such as: When does someone’s life begin and how should it end? What is the proper role of physicians, nurses and other health care providers and what are the rights of their patients? What is a just and fair way to provide access to health-care services and resources? Which potential uses of new genetic and reproductive technologies would represent a legitimate advance in medicine and which would signify the beginning of a humanly degrading ""brave new world""? Indeed, in a society committed to protecting a diversity of lifestyles and opinions, how can citizens resolve significant policy controversies such as whether there should be public funding of human embryonic stem cell research, or a legally protected right to physician assistance in ending one’s life?
  
The aims of this course are to identify the fundamental ethical questions that underlie contemporary biomedical practice; develop skill in analyzing and clarifying key concepts such as autonomy, justice, health and disease; critically assess the healthcare implications of different ethical outlooks; explore how citizens can reasonably address controversial bioethical issues in a mutually respectful and constructive way.
  
The course meets once a week for an hour and a half. Live-session interaction and post-session discussion forums play a key role as students explore, in a give-and-take spirit, the pros and cons of each position.
  
This course is designed for medical students, nursing students, and other healthcare professionals, as well as for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level in biology, philosophy, political science, public health, law, and related fields.",Arthur Kuflik,3:00pm,5:00pm,11756,,K5320-20261-D01,INTRO TO PHILOSOPHICAL BI,Bioethics,BIET,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5320-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,M,20261BIET5320KD01,LECTURE

BIET PS5400,CLINICAL ETHICS,"While this course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of clinical ethics and the basic terminology and framework of ethical analysis in biomedical ethics, it offers a more sociological perspective, putting the contemporary clinical issues into a broader context. We will look briefly at the development of clinical ethics and its impact on hospital care and doctor-patient relationships, on the prevailing autonomy norm and its critique. The course then focuses on issues encountered in clinical practice such as informed consent, patient capacity, decision-making, end of life, advance directives, medical futility, pediatrics ethics, maternal-fetal conflicts, organ transplantation, cultural competence and diversity of beliefs and others. The course will examine the role of the clinical ethics consultant (CEC) and assignments will mimic the work that CECs may perform in the hospital setting.
  
Over the span of the semester, students become familiar with the ethical questions surrounding major topics in the clinic with a practical case-based approach toward ethics dilemmas and ethics consultation. During the semester, students in New York attend a meeting of the adult or pediatric ethics committees of New York Presbyterian and Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital or another area hospital, as well as ethics lectures given at the medical center.

We will explore how the development of clinical practice standards for patients with advanced disease have evolved in response to advances in treatment and societal assertion of consumerist rights of self determination. This work will assist students in the Bioethics Masters Program to develop the consultation skills needed to interact effectively with patients, even under difficult circumstances. We will build on the knowledge base established in the Introduction to Clinical Ethics course (BIETPS5400) to develop the specific insights and skills needed by clinicians and other professionals to support patients and caregivers who confront dilemmas in end of life care management. Students will develop the analytic and communication techniques needed to advise treating clinicians who seek guidance on management of end of life care for patients, and communicating prognosis and treatment options to their patients’ families. The skills developed in this course will be useful to students who will confront ethical dilemmas in their roles as treating clinicians, health care administrators, ethics committee members, compliance officers, and patient advocates.

BIET PS5600,CANCER BIOETHICS,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US and most affluent countries. It represents a complex group of
 diseases with heterogeneity in biology, incidence, prevalence, and outcomes. And unlike other complex and
 potentially life-threatening maladies, a cancer diagnosis is regularly received by patients as a death sentence. It
 elicits dread, despair, hopelessness, and sometimes stigma in patients and their families. The emotional toll of a
 cancer diagnosis and vulnerability that ensues, can profoundly impact patients’ approaches to research and
 treatment.
 The Cancer Bioethics course offers a comprehensive exploration of the diverse ethical issues that arise in the context
 of cancer care and research, providing students with an analytic framework for complex moral dilemmas faced by
 patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. Through case studies, theoretical discussions, and critical
 analysis, students will employ key bioethical principles and their application to cancer care - from diagnosis to
 survivorship or decisions about end-of-life care. Topics will include unique ethical challenges in oncology such as
 the “right not to know” and other challenges associated with disclosures of genomic testing of cancer; the moral
 uncertainty of conducting research in minors diagnosed with cancer and the downstream use of their oncologic data;
 the unbridled optimism and therapeutic illusion among a number of cancer specialists; therapeutic misconception
 among participants in oncologic clinical trials; and the increasing integration of artificial intelligence into new
 models of cancer care and prognostication. The course will also examine the intersection of social determinants of
 health, cultural beliefs and value systems, and healthcare access, addressing the ethical concerns of disparities in
 cancer care.
 The course incorporates curricular elements of clinical ethics, law and bioethics, research ethics, reproductive ethics,
 pediatric ethics, global ethics, environmental ethics, race and bioethics, organ transplant ethics, health policy and
 bioethics, etc. This is an elective course open to cross-registrants from other fields and/or Columbia University

BINF GU4019,Computational Epidemiology,"This course delves into the intersection of epidemiology and computational methods, equipping students with the tools to conduct rigorous epidemiological studies from big clinical data repositories. Students will explore techniques from informatics, computer science, machine learning, and statistics to clean, analyze, and interpret data from electronic health records (EHRs) and other large-scale datasets. Through hands-on projects and case students, students will gain practical experience in applying epidemiologic study designs to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, model disease transmission dynamics, and evaluate interventions. This interdisciplinary approach prepares students to address real-world public health challenges by leveraging the power of data-driven insights. The course is broken up into modules, each of which covers an epidemiologic study design or principle. Modules will range from 1-3 classes, and will include (i) a lecture and (ii) accompanying lab work. Students are expected to read technical texts carefully, participate actively in lecture discussion, and develop hands-on skills in labs involving real-world biomedical and health datasets. Students will curate their own analytic datasets from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)-formatted electronic health record (SynPUF) data.",Amelia J Averitt,2:00pm,3:30pm,11590,,G4019-20261-001,Computational Epidemiolog,Biomedical Informatics,BINF,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BINF/G4019-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261BINF4019G001,LECTURE

Course overview: 
  
Once a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.",Vincent D Fitzpatrick,10:10am,1:00pm,00487,,X2500-20261-001,R for Scientists,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/X2500-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20261BIOL2500X001,LECTURE

BIOL GU4310,VIROLOGY,"The basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:
  
1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.
  
2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).
  
3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.
  
Despite the apparent simplicity, the tactics evolved by particular virus families to survive and prosper are remarkable. This rich set of solutions to common problems in host/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution.
  
The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.",Vincent R Racaniello,4:10pm,5:25pm,13890,,W4310-20261-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W4310-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261BIOL4310W001,LECTURE

The central theme will be curiosity and critical thinking as the twin drivers of both technological innovation and scientific discovery. The course will be divided into a series of modules focused on analysis and presentation of original research papers related to one important breakthrough in molecular biology that occurred during the past century. A prominent theme of the course will be the persistently unpredictable trajectory linking technical research and methodological developments to breakthrough science. Approximately six-to-eight original research papers will be covered in each module, spanning topics from the development of the methods that made the breakthrough possible through practical application of the resulting knowledge.
  
Three or four of the following breakthroughs will likely be covered in 2023:
  
  
Discovery and clinical application of insulin by Banting & Best.

BIOL UN1360,Science and Society,"BIOL 1360 is a seminar for undergraduates in any class who are interested in exploring the complex relationships between science and society, some of which have become especially prominent and controversial during the past several months.   I have enjoyed teaching this course for nearly a decade, at Columbia and elsewhere, based in part on my own experiences conducting and overseeing biomedical research at academic and governmental institutions.
  
Many of our discussions will be built upon the foundational philosophy outlined in a famous short essay by Vannevar Bush and adopted by the US government shortly after World War Two.  His essay helped to define the relationships---among government, academia, and industry---that  influence how scientific work is conducted and supported, how universities operate, and how our nation’s economy, health, security, and prestige rise and fall.
  
The course addresses a wide array of topics, such as: why do people choose a scientific career? why do governments and other funders support scientific work? how does science fail? why is there skepticism about science? how is it represented in the arts? how are results disseminated, evaluated, and legally protected?   These questions and others are addressed from numerous perspectives, with examples taken from many fields of science, mostly biology and medicine, including the Covid-19 pandemic, biotechnology, and others.
  
I will provide assignments for each class --- mainly short articles (from newspapers and scientific journals) and book chapters, but also a few films and short books --- at least a week in advance as topics for discussion.    There will be no final exam or other written tests, but every student will undertake a term project on a topic developed through private consultations with me, and will present the findings orally in class and in a short essay. 
  
I welcome undergraduate students from all classes who are concentrating in any field: the natural or social sciences, humanities, or the arts. There are no prerequisites, other than an interest in how the scientific enterprise works and how it interacts with other components of our society.",Harold Varmus,4:10pm,5:25pm,10994,,W1360-20261-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W1360-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20261BIOL1360W001,LECTURE

BIOL UN3300,Biochemistry,"Prerequisites: 1 year of Introductory Biology, 1 year General Chemistry, and 1st semester Organic Chemistry.  Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes within organisms that give rise to the immense complexity of life. This complexity emerges from a highly regulated and coordinated flow of chemical energy from one biomolecule to another. This course serves to familiarize students with the spectrum of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) as well as the fundamental chemical processes (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, etc.) that allow life to happen. The course will end with a discussion of diseases that have biochemical etiologies. In particular, this course will employ active learning techniques and critical thinking problem-solving to engage students in answering the question: how is the complexity of life possible?

BIOL UN3995,TOPICS IN BIOLOGY,"Topics in Biology: Crossroads in Bioethics. This two credit multidisciplinary and interactive course will focus on contemporary issues in bioethics and medical ethics. Each topic will cover both the underlying science of new biotechnologies and the subsequent bioethical issues that emerge from these technologies. Each topic will introduce a bioethical principle that will be explored using case studies. Students are expected to prepare for each class based on the assignment so that classroom time will be devoted to discussion, case presentations, and role playing rather than merely lectures. Topics include stem cell research, human reproductive cloning, bioterrorism, neuroethics, genetic screening, medical stem cell tourism, patents and science, forensic science and the interface of science and culture/religion.",John Loike,1:10pm,2:25pm,12042,,W3995-20261-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W3995-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,2,,T,20261BIOL3995W001,SEMINAR

BIOT GR5170,Intro to Management Principles - Applica,"Students in the MA in Biotechnology Program at Columbia commonly go on to pursue careers in the biopharmaceutical industry.  The departmental training focus is technical.  However, a basic understanding of management principles can be highly beneficial for optimizing job performance as well as for job advancement, and is commonly a challenging new skill to be mastered by new technical hires in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
  
This course has two components: 1) a survey of the basic elements of management education and 2) a series of actual cases taken from the biopharmaceutical industry which will allow students to see how the basic management principles they have learned are applied. 
  
The cases cover a range of business areas with an emphasis on the effects of business decisions on R&D operations and productivity.   Cases will involve strategies for R&D management, strategies for business operation/expansion, issues of licensing /acquisition versus in house discovery of new products, generics versus brand name proprietary drug businesses, managing mergers and acquisitions and entrepreneurship. 
  
Cases will be rigorously discussed and debated in class.  There is no single route to good management practice or corporate success, so in many instances diametrically opposed opinions will both have merit.  As some students will have had workplace exposure, students should bring such experience and knowledge to case discussions.  The course will thus be in good part taught using the Socratic Method.",Donald Kirsch,12:10pm,2:00pm,10844,,G5170-20261-001,Intro Biopharma Mgmt Prin,Biological Sciences,BIOT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOT/G5170-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,F,20261BIOT5170G001,SEMINAR

BIOT GU4161,ETHICS IN BIOPHARM PAT/REG LAW,"This course – the first of its kind at Columbia – introduces students to a vital subfield of ethics focusing on patent and regulatory law in the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors.  The course combines lectures, structured debate, and research to best present this fascinating and nuanced subject.  Properly exploring this branch of bioethics requires an in-depth understanding of biotech and pharmaceutical patent and regulatory law.  Students can gain this understanding by first completing Biotechnology Law (BIOT GU4160), formerly the prerequisite for this course.  Now, they can also gain it by reading the appropriate chapters of 
Biotechnology Law: A Primer for Scientists
 (the textbook for BIOT GU4160 published earlier this year) prior to each class.  A number of students in the biotechnology fields (such as those in biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and bioethics programs) have shown a keen interest over the years in taking this course, yet were unable to do so because they hadn’t taken BIOT GU4160.  Given the recent publication of

It stands alone in the combination of all four. That also turns it into the world’s most perfect global externality problem: the benefits of fossil-fuel use are internalized, the costs largely externalized. And while misguided market forces are the root cause of climate change, guiding them in the right direction is fundamental to the solution. In this course we explore the fast-changing global climate policy landscape shaping business. We explore the economic principles at work, analyze individual corporate and finance efforts to lead, dive into the regulatory environments around the world, and look to how the clean-energy race creates unique challenges and opportunities.",Gernot Wagner,2:20pm,5:35pm,14455,,B8212-20261-001,,Business Economics,BUEC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8212-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

BUEC B8223,Globalization & Markets & the Changing E,"Recent years have seen closer integration of countries around the world, with increased flows of goods and services, capital and knowledge. There are two alternative views concerning globalization: one, reflected in the protest marches from Seattle to Genoa, argues that globalization has hurt the poor, has been bad for the environment and is governed by undemocratic institutions operating behind closed doors, advancing corporate and financial interests of the more developed countries. The other argues that globalization is the only means by which developing countries will be able to grow and eradicate poverty. This course tries to enhance understanding of these alternative perspectives. It analyzes the underlying forces that have led to globalization and identifies its effects, particularly in developing countries and when and why it has had the adverse effects that its critics claim and when and why it has had the positive effects that its proponents argue for. It also examines the need for international collective action, discusses the structure and conduct of international economic organizations and assesses the extent to which they are to be blamed for the failures of globalization or should take credit for its successes. The course ends with a discussion of alternative reforms of the global economic architecture.""",,9:00am,5:00pm,14368,,B8223-20261-001,Globalization & Markets &,Business Economics,BUEC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8223-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TWRFS,20261BUEC8223B001,LECTURE

If climate pollution is so bad, why is polluting so profitable?

BUEC B8255,FinTech: Consumer Financial Services,"Technological innovation has been transforming the financial services industry, and further disruption is almost a certainty. Financial Technology (“FinTech”) start-ups are tackling many realms of consumer financial services, including mobile payments, foreign exchange, marketplace (peer-to-peer) lending, saving and investing, financial advice (robo-advisers), and property-casualty, health and life insurance.  
The goal of this course is to understand the economic and technological forces driving this change and to learn how to harness them in a responsible way. The curriculum is organized by product areas within consumer financial services, and for each area we’ll cover the underlying economics, the technology, the public policy issues, the competition, and the potential for collaboration between start-ups and the incumbents. Note that we will not cover in depth the topics of cryptocurrencies and blockchain - if these are your primary interests, there are other courses offered focusing specifically on these topics.
A key component of the course is a collaborative team student project: each team will propose and develop a prototype for a new fintech venture. At the end of the semester each team will present its project to the class, and a guest from an NYC venture capital firm will join us and provide feedback.",Stephen Zeldes,2:20pm,5:35pm,14461,,B8255-20261-001,FinTech: Consumer Financi,Business Economics,BUEC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUEC/B8255-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

The course will present the economic rationale for competition policy and provide students with an understanding of the practice of competition law.  Through the examination of prominent antitrust actions, we will review the economic theories underlying competition law and we will discuss how competition policy places limits on firm behavior and affects firm strategies and managerial choices. The course will start with an overview of the institutional framework of competition policy in the U.S. and in the E.U. and an economic analysis of welfare implications of market power. Then, it will address different types of actions that are the focus of competition policy enforcement: mergers, collusions, and unilateral conducts. These actions will be analyzed through the study of well-known antitrust actions in the U.S. and in the E.U.

Students will work with companies that are enrolled in the Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness Africa.  Known as EC-Africa, this program is offered by CBS Executive Education and equips African entrepreneurs with the skills, tools, and contacts to professionalize and grow their businesses in today’s global environment. Each company enrolls a team of two or three senior staff — CEO, founder, managing director, CFO, COO, or other leaders. The companies are all looking to scale. Each company is unique in industry and size, and typically ranges from $1M to $15M in annual revenue, and 10 to 500 employees. To learn more about the EC-America program and the enrolled companies, check out the EC-Africa website (https://business.columbia.edu/ecp)
The class is valuable not only for students who are going to work in management consulting after their MBA, but for everybody who wants to apply their learning from the MBA to the benefit of a company as well as those who want to sharpen their entrepreneurial skills. Through MCL, companies get access to CBS MBA students to work on a critical project. In return, MBA students experience a structured approach to learn 1) rigorous problem solving and project management skills, 2) client interactions, and 3) application of knowledge and skills learned in their coursework. The structure of the MCL course is very different than a normal class. The class is almost entirely project-based, and students are grouped into teams of three depending on their expertise.

BUSI B8710,Global Immersion: Consulting and Advisin,"Family enterprises are the most prevalent form of organization worldwide, yet they are also the most complex. Advisors must navigate business-related challenges, ownership issues, and the evolving dynamics of growing families. With an expected transition of $180 trillion in the next decade and $70 trillion already underway, family enterprises are increasingly attractive clients for advisors.
  
Many advisors mistakenly equate years of practice with competence, overlooking the need for specialized training in family enterprises. Research highlights a troubling misalignment: while family firms prioritize relational concerns as key drivers of business operations, strategy, decision-making, and work roles, advisors often focus on structural and cognitive aspects. This misalignment can lead to ineffective or even damaging outcomes for both the family and the business.
  
The primary objectives of this course are to identify and build the skills related to the profession of advising family enterprises to increase the potential for creating long-term value for clients and advisors and to create awareness around the biggest risks and mistakes advisors may encounter while advising family enterprises, exploring the concept of 
code of ethics
. This course aims to bridge the gap between advisors' general practices and the specific needs of family enterprises by providing specialized education and firsthand cultural experiences.
  
As culture plays a significant role in shaping the decision-making process of enterprising families, particularly in terms of individualism and collectivism, this class offers a unique opportunity to explore the profound impact of these factors on the identity of such families. By immersing ourselves in Italy, we will witness collectivism in action, gaining invaluable insights into its influence within families and among advisors. Moreover, this international trip provides a platform to experience firsthand the contrasting dynamics of transactional and relational environments, enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted nature of business relationships.
  
By the end of this course, participants will have explored and experienced the core of advising family enterprises as a profession, including appreciating specific skills, interpersonal and value-based competencies, and concrete behaviors showing professionalism to be better prepared to appreciate and navigate the complexities of family enterprises.

 This Global Immersion course provides students with knowledge, insights, and experiences with respect to Israel’s innovation ecosystem. What is the “secret sauce” that propelled Israel to its present leadership position, a global innovation and entrepreneurship hub often referred to as “startup nation,” that hails the highest concentration of startups and unicorns per capita?  The course's in-class meetings and its one week visit to Israel will provide background and hands on exposure to some of the key drivers, including leadership, politics, economics, geography, and culture. Students will gain an understanding of Israel's unique circumstances and achievements through a combination of academic learnings, guest speakers, business and government leaders that will share first hand experiences and perspectives, and on-the-ground exposure to Israeli businesses, cultural and historical sites. 
  
 This Global Immersion course begins with six 1.5-hour sessions, followed by a one-week study trip to Israel.  The course's pedagogy combines current examples, presentations, guest visits by leaders from business and government.  
  
Travel to Israel is planned for March 14-21, 2026.The ongoing conflict in the region over the past two years has fortunately culminated in a recent cease fire, of which the US was instrumental in brokering and enforcing. Nevertheless,  It is possible that if the security situation deteriorates,  we will have to cancel and offer an alternative travel plan.

Average annual GDP per person has risen dramatically over the past two decades, from below US$ 1,000 per person in 2000 to US$ 3,500 by 2022. Philippines is on track to become one-trillion dollar economy by 2033.  The central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, is well managed and follows a sound monetary policy.  The long-term prospect for the country is contingent upon improvement in governance, reducing income inequality, tackling corruption and a better regulatory environment.  After losing its way for the past few decades, Philippines seems to be on the right path.  We will develop a strong foundation in understanding Philippines’ history, economy, industry and competitive position, before we visit the country.

This forward-looking course will consider the opportunities created by South Africa’s multiple identities, the lingering implications of its particular history, its current challenges, and its position at the intersection of advanced and emerging global markets.
Through a combination of lectures, guest speakers, group projects, and site visits, students will have the opportunity to develop an intimate understanding of South Africa’s business environment and to extract insights and lessons on creating impact in a range of economic landscapes. The course will delve into crucial issues that include South Africa’s ongoing post-apartheid transformation, the role of natural resources in South Africa’s past and future, developments in the country’s burgeoning new-economy sectors, prospects for innovation and entrepreneurship, and the possibilities created by ever-greater integration with the rest of the African continent. With a focus on climate change, sustainable development, and social responsibility, this course will also look at how South African business has made tangible progress in grappling with this combination of triple-bottom-line imperatives. We will meet with a diverse collection of business, labour, government, and community leaders from a wide range of sectors, industries, and organizations. Meetings will include multinationals that have adapted themselves to South Africa’s specificities and home-grown businesses that are taking South Africa to the world.

But there’s more…: Very successful and admired business leaders think even more fundamentally and broadly about the economic, political, and social context of business decision making. They understand that the ‘corporation’ is a legal and social construct, not just an economic construct. Support for business corporations has not been and is not absolute and requires business leaders to examine the role of their business and business generally in the broader society — business and society. In contemporary language, what is the ‘purpose’ of business? For whom should the corporation be run? Answers to these questions and others shape business, business careers, and attitudes toward business. 
Addressing such cross-cutting questions requires that we examine the business corporation and its role in society through multiple perspectives. In particular, we will study business and society through the lenses of the evolving business organization,
finance and investors, employees, corporate governance, privacy and big data, social movements, social justice, and climate change. To accomplish these views, we will draw on leading CBS faculty and their ideas. In each case, we will complement these ideas with the
experience of leading business practitioners as teaching partners. The introductory and closing sessions will feature longer conversations with a business leader on the role of business in society. Conducting the course in this way brings both ‘business and society’
and Columbia Business School’s ‘ideas, talent, and network’ to center stage.
You will also be co-creating this course with the teaching team. Your presence, preparation, and participation are vital to a successful class experience. The syllabus presents questions and readings to get you ready for our class discussion and analysis.
All of us on the teaching team look forward to working with you!",R. Glenn Hubbard,2:20pm,5:35pm,14691,,B8784-20261-001,,Business,BUSI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BUSI/B8784-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

CEEN IA7730,"Climate Finance, Policy, and Just Transi","The field of responsible investment has grown rapidly over the last twenty years, with the climate crisis serving as the paradigmatic ESG issue for investors. In the private sector, investors pledge to decarbonize their portfolios, ask for carbon reporting to manage that task, join together to engage corporations on their transition plans. As activity has grown, questions about the effectiveness and limitations of climate finance approaches to the climate crisis have grown along with them. A narrow focus on decarbonization has begun to give way to broader considerations of the transition and the risks and opportunities it poses for affected workers and communities, on the belief that social cohesion is a precondition for successful transition. Private sector initiatives have been complemented with public policy and public investment efforts to shape environmental, social, and economic outcomes. Climate finance is in a moment of reflection, change, and doubt.
  
This course will survey and analyze the ways that public and private investment are being or could be directed in support of a Just Transition (i.e., a low-carbon transition that does not worsen social inequalities), and various ways to think about how effective climate finance can be. We will look at investors’ approaches to the decarbonization of the economy in political and social context, asking: how do or should investors integrate concerns for workers, communities, and environment into climate finance? what kinds of public policies are needed to ensure that investment points towards a Just Transition? The result, we hope, will lead both to a better understanding of the roles public and private investment in a Just Transition, climate policy, and an expanded critical capacity to analyze how well it’s working.",David C Wood,,,10276,,U7730-20261-001,"Clim Fin, Policy, & Just","Climate, Energy, & Environment",CEEN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CEEN/U7730-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261CEEN7730U001,LECTURE

Moreover, they will learn how (for-profit and non-profit) organizations develop innovative products and services that help mitigate grand challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, social inequality, poverty, etc., and enable them to grow their business and sustain their competitive advantage over time.
  
Throughout the semester, students will work on an actual sustainable investing research consulting project for a client from across the world. They will (e-)meet with the client on a regular basis, discuss their progress, obtain feedback, and present their recommendation to the client. Furthermore, students will conduct research and interviews to learn about the broader business environment and institutional context (including cultural, political, economic, and social factors) to better understand the opportunities and challenges the clients face.
  
This course is ideal for students interested in pursuing careers in sustainable finance, impact investing, ESG, corporate sustainability, social entrepreneurship, and sustainable development. 
  
The Sustainable Investing Research Consulting course offers consulting projects from around the world, covering a broad range of topics in sustainable investing. Clients include start-ups and established firms, non-profit and for-profit organizations, and clients from the finance and investing world. For more information on client projects and the student experiences, please see the SIRI website:

However, this textile is torn and frayed. People are – as they have been for centuries - fragmented by war, religion, disasters and crises, poverty, and disparate concentrations of wealth. In this class, we will examine these various fault lines, by addressing issues such as cultural difference, nationalism, populism, and identity politics.

CGTH GR6800,Global Political Economy and Governance,"The “liberal international order,” which until recently appeared inevitable to many observers, faces numerous challenges that have erupted in the past few years—including war, heightened superpower rivalry, the imposition of sanctions and tariffs, and economic stagnation. To this list, we must add a series of preexisting conditions, such as ballooning inequality and persistent North-South divides, the climate crisis, rising nationalist and xenophobic sentiment, and increasing support—on both the left and right—for protectionism and skepticism of “free trade” and (global) capitalism itself. In turn, the very utility (and desirability) of global-governance mechanisms and institutions is increasingly being called into question. 
  
This course centers around analyzing the political economy and structure of the contemporary world order, its underlying logics, origins and inherently political nature, how it is (and is not) governed, and how power is exercised therein by actors including states, corporations, international institutions, and even individuals. As we will highlight throughout the semester, issues related to global political economy and governance shape the lives of people all over the world, including our own. 
  
Specifically, we will discuss the origins and consolidation of today’s “liberal international order,” especially vis-à-vis its economic dimensions and the rise of global neoliberalisms, along with its trials, tribulations, and challengers, its “governance” and spatial logics, and the various forms of backlash against it that are currently proliferating. We will also carefully analyze the role of race, class, and gender in global economics and politics, as well as the persistence of colonial legacies, and the ongoing relevance of North-South and other inequalities. Additionally, we will discuss how issues such as the climate crisis, U.S.-China relations, and technological change are shaping the future trajectory of the global political-economic order (or orders). 
  
To shed light on these and related matters, we will critically engage with the contributions of a diverse and interdisciplinary array of classic and contemporary thinkers who have sought to 
theorize 
the global economy, global governance, and world order, as well as the dynamic interplay between global politics and economics, in different ways.

CGTH UN3402,YOUTH-INTERCONNECTED WRLD,"What does it mean to be 20 years old in our rapidly changing, interconnected world? There are more youth (aged 15-25) in the world today than at any other time in history, with the majority living in the developing world. They approach adulthood as the world confronts seismic shifts in the geopolitical order, in the nature and future of work, and in the ways we connect with each other, express identity, engage politically, and create communities of meaning. What unique challenges and opportunities confront young people after decades of neoliberal globalization? What issues are most pressing in developing nations experiencing a “youth bulge” and how do they compare to developed nations with rapidly aging populations? How do young people envision their futures and the future of the world they are inheriting? This course will examine recent scholarship while engaging the young people in the class to define the agenda and questions of the course, and to conduct their own research. This course is part of the Global Core curriculum. “Global 20” complements a new research project of the Committee on Global Thought, “Youth in a Changing World,” which investigates from the perspective of diverse participants and of young people themselves, the most pressing issues confronting young people in the changing world today. The course will serve as an undergraduate “lab” for the project, and among other involvements, students in the course will help conceive, plan, and take part in a NYC-wide “Youth Think-In” sponsored by the CGT during the Spring 2018 semester. Within the course, students will become “regional experts” and examine the primary themes of the class through the prism of specific areas or nations of their choosing. A final class project includes a “design session” that will consider how universities might better train and empower youth to confront the challenges and embrace the opportunities of our interconnected world of the 21stcentury.",Laura L Neitzel,12:10pm,2:00pm,11514,,W3402-20261-001,,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/W3402-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20261CGTH3402W001,SEMINAR

CHEM GU4313,Peptide and Protein Chemistry,"The goal of this course is to explore how chemical methods and concepts have impacted our ability to understand and manipulate protein structure and function. We will navigate this subject through a combination of lectures and structured discussions on research articles from the literature. The course is divided into three segments: (1) In the first part, we will review the rudiments of protein structure and function, then delve into various aspects of enzyme chemistry and polypeptide biosynthesis. (2) In the second part of the course, we will cover synthetic methods to produce and chemically modify peptides and proteins. (3) In the final part, we will discuss chemical approaches to control protein function and monitor protein activity, focusing on methods that use small molecules and mass spectrometry proteomics.",Neel H Shah,10:10am,11:25am,11520,,W4313-20261-001,Peptide and Protein Chemi,Chemistry,CHEM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CHEM/W4313-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261CHEM4313W001,LECTURE

CLCV BC3000,"ETHNICITY, RACE, &POWER IN ANCT MEDITERR","Concepts of ethnicity and race – deeply complex and often fraught – are catalyzing forces in modern society. This seminar explores the changing definitions and resonances of these categories in ancient contexts. Course readings will cover a variety of societies but return repeatedly to Egypt and Nubia as a touchstone. Over the course of the semester, we will explore how Nubians and Egyptians viewed one another as well as how both Egyptians and Nubians experienced and were experienced by immigrants, colonizers, and travelers. Throughout the ancient Mediterranean, as we’ll see, self-definitions and cultural boundaries shifted radically according to changing power dynamics both within groups and between them.
  
 
  
In seminar discussions, we’ll pose the following questions: How and when did groups who saw themselves as distinct from one another cooperate and intermarry? Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ. In our discussions and investigations this semester we will learn a great deal about Northeast Africa in antiquity – but, so too, about ethnicity, concepts of race, and power throughout the ancient Mediterranean.",,10:10am,11:25am,00189,,X3000-20261-001,"ETHNCTY,RACE&POWR:ANC MED",Classics @Barnard,CLCV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/X3000-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20261CLCV3000X001,SEMINAR

CLCV UN3008,The Age of Augustus,"The reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (27bce-14ce), has been seen as a Roman revolution, both political and cultural. Rome had for centuries been governed as a Republic, but a series of increasingly divisive civil wars allowed Augustus to create a new political system in which he exercised sole rule as the ‘first citizen’ within a ‘Restored Republic’. Augustus’ reign lasted more than 40 years, and established a model of autocratic rule that would last for four centuries. During this time there were profound changes in the political, social, and cultural structures of Rome. In this course, you will examine the nature of these changes, Augustus’ political strategies, military activities, and religious initiatives through his own writing, the accounts of (often hostile) historians and a range of literary and archaeological sources, including Roman poetry. Ultimately, we will address the question: how did Augustus achieve the seemingly paradoxical feat of becoming a monarch within a republican system?",Lien Van Geel,1:10pm,2:25pm,11115,,W3008-20261-002,,Classics,CLCV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/W3008-20261-002/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261CLCV3008W002,LECTURE

CLEN UN3725,Literary Guides to Living and Dying Well,"Surrounded by friends on the morning of his state-mandated suicide, Socrates invites them to join him in considering the proposition that philosophizing is learning how to die. In dialogues, essays, and letters from antiquity to early modernity, writers have returned to this proposition from Plato’s 
Phaedo
 to consider, in turn, what it means for living and dying well. This course will explore some of the most widely read of these works, including by Cicero, Seneca, Jerome, Augustine, Boethius, Petrarch, and Montaigne, with an eye to the continuities and changes in these meanings and their impact on the literary forms that express them.

CLFR GU4321,The Maghreb in Transition: Society & Cul,"This course explores the production of culture in the contemporary Maghreb. We consider how important dimensions of social and political life are explored in literature and film and, correspondingly, the role that these and other media play in shaping social and political dynamics. The focus is on Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, but these nations are also situated in broader regional and global contexts. Former French colonies, these three nations  have in common a multilingual cultural environment in which French coexists with Arabic and Amazigh languages.
  
 
  
The course begins in roughly 1990, a time of disenchantment when the political regimes established at Independence were challenged and in some cases replaced. We explore the dynamics of Algeria’s ‘Black Decade’ and Morocco’s emergence from the ‘Years of lead,’ then turn to more recent social and political dynamics, notably the ‘Arab spring’ of 2011-2012 and the ongoing Algerian 
hirak
. Throughout the course we consider how the arts have responded to and contributed to change while also revisiting the past and reframing national narratives.
  
 
  
The course is interdisciplinary, combining historical, sociological and anthropological approaches with close reading of texts and films. The syllabus is organized both historically and thematically. We explore questions including the representation and memory of violence, the geographies and sociology of migration and globalization, and the changing landscape of media and publication.

CLFR GU4521,"The Politics of Memory. Remembrance, Eth","This seminar will explore the multidimensional interplay between collective memory, politics, and history in France since 1945. We will examine the process of memorializing key historical events and periods – the Vichy regime, the Algerian War, the slave trade – and the critical role they played in shaping and dividing French collective identity. This exploration will focus on multiple forms of narratives – official history, victims’ accounts, literary fiction – and will examine the tensions and contradictions that oppose them. The seminar will discuss the political uses of memory, the influence of commemorations on French collective identity, and the role played by contested monuments, statues and other “
lieux de mémoire
” (“sites of memory”). We will ask how these claims on historical consciousness play out in the legal space through an exploration of French “memorial laws”, which criminalize genocide denial and recognize slave trade as a crime against humanity. These reflections will pave the way to retracing the genesis of the “
devoir de mémoire
” (“duty to remember”), a notion that attempts to confer an ethical dimension to collective memory. The seminar will examine the multiple uses of the French injunction to remember – as a response to narratives of denial, as an act of justice towards the victims, and as an antidote to the recurrence of mass crimes and persecutions. We will examine how amnesty is used to reconcile conflicting collective memories and will evaluate the claim that the transmission",Emmanuel Kattan,4:10pm,6:00pm,11806,,G4521-20261-001,The Politics of Memory,French,CLFR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLFR/G4521-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261CLFR4521G001,SEMINAR
CLGM UN3110,THE OTTOMAN PAST IN THE GREEK PRESENT,"Almost a century after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman past lives on in contemporary Greece, often in unexpected sites. In the built environment it appears as mosques, baths, covered markets, and fountains adorned with Arabic inscriptions. It also manifests itself in music, food, and language. Yet Ottoman legacies also shape the European present in less obvious ways and generate vehement debates about identity, nation-building, human rights, and interstate relations. In this course, we will be drawing on history, politics, anthropology, and comparative literature as well as a broad range of primary materials to view the Ottoman past through the lens of the Greek present. What understandings of nation-building emerge as more Ottoman archives became accessible to scholars? How does Islamic Family Law—still in effect in Greece—confront the European legal system?

CLGM UN3650,Mental health in Literature from antiqui,"This seminar explores the relationship between literature, culture, and mental health. It pays particular emphasis to the 
poetics
 of emotions structuring them around the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance and the concept of hope. During the course of the semester, we will discuss a variety of content that explores issues of race, socioeconomic status, political beliefs, abilities/disabilities, gender expressions, sexualities, and stages of life as they are connected to mental illness and healing. Emotions are anchored in the physical body through the way in which our bodily sensors help us understand the reality that we live in. By feeling backwards and thinking forwards, we will ask a number of important questions relating to literature and mental health, and will trace how human experiences are first made into language, then into science, and finally into action.

CLGR UN3460,Narrating Immigration Control,"“The passport is the noblest part of a human being,” wrote the German exiled writer Bertolt Brecht in the late 1930s. When millions fled Nazi political and racial persecution, and before any country had a designated refugee policy, the immigration and identification system of control as we know it today was relatively new. For the refugees, having the right papers meant a difference between life and death. Visas, passports, and other documents also began to appear in Hollywood films, novels, and critical writing. Almost a century later, Germany, now a destination for refugees from other, war-ridden regions, is still ruled by papers. In this seminar, we will read and watch refugee narratives from these two biggest “refugee crises” in human history. We will study shifting refugee policies and bureaucratic practices along with their roles in cultural imaginations. We will trace the history of passports, visas, and identification as integral to the development of the modern state, and examine their symbolic values in a variety of aesthetic mediums, such as literature, film, dance, and video games.",Didi Tal,12:10pm,2:00pm,10774,,W3460-20261-001,Narrating Immigration Con,Germanic Languages,CLGR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLGR/W3460-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20261CLGR3460W001,SEMINAR

CLMT G5013,Climate Mobility,"It is widely accepted that climate factors can and do affect human mobility, though the degree of their influence varies depending on local contexts. In the case of population displacement, rapid onset climate extremes have a relatively direct impact on mobility, and for longer-term migration climate factors also have been shown to play a role, often mediated by more direct drivers. There is a growing recognition that underlying institutional and structural factors (i.e., root causes) shape the way the climate stressors impact local migration decision-making, and that cultural proclivities and inequitable access to resources, markets, and political power structures often set the stage for ensuing migration flows (domestic and international). In many low income settings the donor and development assistance community are grappling with these complex nexus issues as they seek to develop policies and programs that reduce the potential for distress or mass migration. Responses to date generally fall into four categories; 1) those that address the livelihood aspects of climate migration -- e.g., by improving the prospects for local adaptation; 2) those that seek to facilitate mobility as an adaptation mechanism; 3) those that resettle people in new locations and offer migrant protections; and 4) those that seek to mitigate the impacts of those movements, including environmental impacts, on receiving communities. In high income settings, responses to current and potentially increased immigration from developing countries tends to fall into two camps: a resurgent nationalism with measures to prevent or deter migration versus more migrant-friendly policies that seek to protect migrant rights while acknowledging responsibility for historic greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, high income countries are facing climate impacts of their own such as sea level rise, riparian flooding and massive fires that have displaced thousands and prompted managed retreat from at-risk areas. All this has brought to the fore questions of equity and climate justice as marginalized populations everywhere are often disproportionately affected and least compensated. This interdisciplinary course focuses on the social, demographic, economic, political, environmental and climatic factors that shape human mobility, while addressing the legal categories of international mobility (e.g., migrant versus refugee). We explore underlying drivers of the various types of migration – from forced to voluntary and those forms in between – in ord",Alexander M Desherbinin,1:10pm,3:40pm,12174,,G5013-20261-001,,Climate School,CLMT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5013-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20261CLMT5013G001,LECTURE

CLMT G5029,Black Ecologies,"African and African Diasporic peoples have been central to the creation and transformation of global ecologies and landscapes. As the birthplace of humankind, the African continent features the longest archaeological record in the world, with abundant, yet often underrepresented, material and historical evidence for remarkable Indigenous African innovations in the areas of technology, food production, and resource and land use. This course specifically examines Black ecologies preceding and then radically transformed by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the enslavement of millions of Africans and their forced translocation to the Americas and Caribbean precipitated ecological transformations on all sides of the Atlantic, as African peoples, knowledge, resources and ecological inheritances were appropriated by the European mercantile system. Enslaved Africans transformed American landscapes via extractive industries of plantations and mines and suffered the emergence of toxic landscapes and disease alongside Native American communities. Africans also recreated African ecologies as they created livelihoods and landscapes of resistance and freedom in the Americas. The legacies of the Atlantic Era maintain a persistent dynamic in which African and African Diasporic communities experience disproportionate burdens of environmental injustice today. The concept of Black ecologies reflects the marginality, systemic racism and dispossession experienced by Black peoples and their landscapes. Black ecologies also allow us to understand African and African Diasporic ecological innovations, resistance and resilience, and the pathways to future sustainability and justice they promise.",Kristina Douglass,10:10am,12:40pm,12186,,G5029-20261-001,,Climate School,CLMT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5029-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20261CLMT5029G001,LECTURE
CLMT G5032,Disaster Research Methods,"The field of disaster research is relatively new in the United States, as a specific field of study, with the first disaster research center being founded in the early 1960s. The field itself is now highly multi-disciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, anthropology, political science, computer science, engineering, earth sciences, psychology, and medicine and public health. These academic fields have intersected with the practice community by informing holistic emergency planning for all members of a community. Furthermore, these research outputs have informed federal and state policy, the private sector, and community organizations to inform program design and implementation. Translating research into practice remains a constant challenge in this rapidly evolving field. The methodological approaches to disaster research are just as diverse and have become increasingly complex with the advent of big data, the ubiquity of spatial information, and novel cross-disciplinary research. As a new era of compound and cascading disasters has triggered a constant “response” mode within the field of emergency management, the need for practitioners and research with a fluency in research and evaluation methods is required to critically evaluate or generate high quality and ethically based research.",Jonathan J Sury,10:10am,12:40pm,12188,,G5032-20261-001,,Climate School,CLMT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5032-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20261CLMT5032G001,LECTURE

CLMT G5044,Spatial Analysis of Food Security,"Globally, over 2 billion people are suffering from moderate-to-severe food insecurity and the Sudan famine being the first famine declared in 2025 since 2020. One key aspect to understanding food insecurity is its spatial distribution and trends that contribute to how food secure a population is. This course will teach students how to collect and analyze spatial data related to food security, as well as touch on important topics in food insecurity. The course will focus on taking real-life food security questions and applying spatial analysis techniques to these questions. In the course, we will cover an introduction to spatial analysis, natural experiments in geography, applying remote sensing to food insecurity, climate shocks and food security, and seasonal forecasting and food security.  
  
This class will have a lecture aspect, which will mainly focus on topics in food security and how they relate to data collection, and a lab section, which will be an opportunity for students to collect data directly, clean the data, and analyze the data using the R programming language with spatial research methods. Example topics in class will be climate variability and food insecurity, policies that can successfully address food insecurity, and understanding spatial aggregation in food security statistics and how that can influence interpretation. These topics will then be further explored in the lab section of the class: specifically focusing on downloading weather data for time series analysis, using a convergence of datasets to map hotspots, and investigating how survey data intersects with spatial datasets.",Sarah L Blakeley,10:10am,12:40pm,12194,,G5044-20261-001,Spatial Analysis Food Sec,Climate School,CLMT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5044-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20261CLMT5044G001,SEMINAR

CLMT G5054,"Sovereign Finance, Climate and Developme","The ability of many emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) countries to meet their climate financing objectives depends to a large extent on their cost of capital, which in turn is impacted by the actual and perceived risks of their sovereign debt.  According to the Jubilee Report published in June 2025 by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and the Columbia University Initiative for Policy Dialogue, 54 countries spend over ten percent of their revenues on interest payments, and 3.3 billion people live in countries that spend more on interest than healthcare.  EMDE countries need workable tools to reduce financing costs and manage sovereign debt in order to fund their development needs and to achieve the climate objectives set out in their nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement.  
  
This course will explore the roots of the problem, including the pro-cyclical nature of sovereign financing and refinancing; the role of international financial institutions and credit rating agencies; and the main obstacles to resolving sovereign debt distress in an orderly and timely way, contrasting resolution tools for sovereign debt with those available in the private sector.  Drawing on real-world case studies, we will look at structural innovations that could help debottleneck climate finance, and how effective they can be.  We will consider several prominent proposals to reorient the global financial architecture, focusing on whether and to what extent they can reduce EMDE funding costs and unlock financing for sustainable development and climate investment.",,10:10am,12:40pm,12201,,G5054-20261-001,"Sovereign Finc, Climate,",Climate School,CLMT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLMT/G5054-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,F,20261CLMT5054G001,SEMINAR

CLPS GU4201,BASIC CONCEPTS-POST-FREUD THGT,"This course examines psychoanalytic movements that are viewed either as post-Freudian in theory or as emerging after Freuds time. The course begins by considering the ways Freuds cultural and historical surround, as well as the wartime diaspora of the European psychoanalytic community, shaped Freudian and post-Freudian thought. It then focuses on significant schools and theories of psychoanalysis that were developed from the mid 20th century to the present. Through readings of key texts and selected case studies, it explores theorists challenges to classical thought and technique, and their reconfigurations, modernizations, and total rejections of central Freudian ideas. The course concludes by looking at contemporary theorists moves to integrate notions of culture, concepts of trauma, and findings from neuroscience and attachment research into the psychoanalytic frame.",Adele Tutter,10:10am,12:00pm,10982,,G4201-20261-001,BASIC CONCEPTS-POST-FREUD,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CLPS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLPS/G4201-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20261CLPS4201G001,SEMINAR
CLRS GR6217,Dostoevsky's Afterlives,"Few modern writers have been as adored, reviled, translated, or adapted as Fyodor Dostoevsky. In this seminar, we explore the “afterlife/survival” (
Überleben
) of Dostoevsky’s writings, with a particular emphasis on his reception and transformations during the decades of global modernism. We will ask: when and how was the dominant 20th-century image of Dostoevsky made? How is this image reflected, and refracted, in the later theory and practice of the novel? What resonances has it found across the political spectrum, from the pre-revolutionary Russian Empire through interwar Europe, the mid-century United States, and our present era of resurgent technocracy, imperialism, and nationalism? The first half of the course focuses on the Silver Age writers who did most to frame Dostoevsky’s legacy and artistic persona for an international readership. In the second half, we turn to a range of historical, literary, and theoretical contexts where this legacy comes into play. Students will take an active role in researching and shaping the story about Dostoevsky’s uncanny “survival” that our course tells, engaging with a range of readings in modernist literature, criticism, and novel theory. Midway through the course, each student will be responsible for a reception case study, researching either a place and time where Dostoevsky was widely influential or (by permission) a single author whose work comes into close dialogue with his.
  
Note: Russian-language readings will be provided in the original; many are also available in translation. Other readings will be provided and discussed in English translation, though reading in the original is always encouraged.

Sakhalin Island, 
his study of the Russian penal colony.

CLRS UN3317,Empire and Periphery: Narratives of Powe,"The Soviet Union was a country of paradoxes. While the Soviet government promoted national self-determination by establishing autonomous territories and fostering the development of national languages and cultures, it simultaneously engaged with practices of domination and control akin to European colonial empires. This course seeks to elucidate the inherent ideological tensions of the Soviet system through the works of authors and filmmakers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, situating them within the broader context of what has come to be known as postcolonial theory.
  
Beginning with the Soviet Union’s self-championing as the first anti-imperialist state, we will explore how writers and filmmakers from the Soviet metropole imagined and constructed the idea of an internal Other. Moving beyond the metropolitan imagination, we will examine how imperial categorizations were challenged by writers and filmmakers from the so-called Soviet ""periphery."" How did the non-European part of the population of the Soviet Union negotiate questions of identity, assimilation into the dominant culture, and resistance within the frameworks of Soviet modernization, nationality policy, and the official aesthetic doctrine of the Soviet Union - Socialist Realism?  Finally, we will delve into how Soviet-era discourses persist and evolve in the post-Soviet context, influencing contemporary geopolitical and social realities across the Eurasian region.

CLSL BC2301,Dreaming Empire: Britain & Russia in 19C,"The course falls neatly into two halves, addressing the British and Russian empires as they were in the 19th century. The purpose of the course is to become familiar with imperial thinking, the thought (pro-empire, anti-empire, and simply permeated by empire, to put it in terms familiar to a contemporary audience) implicit in various literary works of the time. For the most part, the readings assigned are primary texts. These will be heavily supplemented during course meetings: the instructor will bring in various materials that would be obscure if assigned to students outside of class, but with live explanations in-class, will enrich their understanding of the primary readings.
  
Most readings are literary texts, though students will also read and receive guidance in secondary academic literature about those works. A few philosophical and historical texts from the time under examination will also be assigned.",John C Wright,1:10pm,2:25pm,00180,,X2301-20261-001,Dreaming Empire: Brit&Rus,Slavic Languages @Barnard,CLSL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLSL/X2301-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261CLSL2301X001,LECTURE
CLSL GU4012,Holocaust Literature: Critical Thinking,"How do you write literature in the midst of catastrophe? To whom do you write if you don’t know whether your readership will survive? Or that you yourself will survive? How do you theorize society when the social fabric is tearing apart? How do you develop a concept of human rights at a time when mass extermination is deemed legal? How do you write Jewish history when Jewish future seems uncertain?
  
This course offers a survey of the literature and intellectual history written during World War II (1939-1945) both in Nazi occupied Europe and in the free world, written primarily, but not exclusively, by Jews. We will read novels, poems, science fiction, historical fiction, legal theory and social theory and explore how intellectuals around the world responded to the extermination of European Jewry as it happened and how they changed their understanding of what it means to be a public intellectual, what it means to be Jewish, and what it means to be human.
  
The aim of the course is threefold. First, it offers a survey of the Jewish experience during WWII, in France, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Romania, Greece, Palestine, Morocco, Iraq, the USSR, Argentina, and the United States. Second, it introduces some of the major contemporary debates in holocaust studies. Finally, it provides a space for a methodological reflection on how literary analysis, cultural studies, and historical research intersect.",Offer Dynes,4:10pm,6:00pm,10891,,W4012-20261-001,Holocaust Lit: Critical T,Slavic Languages,CLSL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLSL/W4012-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20261CLSL4012W001,SEMINAR
CLSL GU4029,"Bible, Literature, Theory","This class aims to introduce the students to the field of Bible and Literature, with special attention to the Hebrew Bible and to Literary Theory. We will read portions of 
Genesis, Numbers, Jonah, Hosea, Ezekiel, Esther, Mark, 
and
 Revelations
, and discuss it in tandem with literary theory as well as 20th Century literary texts. Literary theory, this class will argue, is central for our understanding of the Bible, and, at the same time, the Biblical text is essential for the manner in which we theorize literature. Our discussion will be guided by four loosely interconnected questions: What insights can we gain about the theology of the Biblical text from a literary analysis? What happens to theological ideas once they are dramatized and narrativized? In what way can modern literary adaptations of the Bible contribute to our understanding of the Biblical text? How does the Bible challenge and trouble some of the perceived ideas of literary theory?
  
The syllabus is divided into three units. The first unit —
Bible and Literature in Theory,
 offers a survey of some of the scholarly approaches to the intersection of literature and theology. We will read theory that interrogates the intersection of theological and literary concepts, focusing on omniscience, authorship, temporality, characterization, and plot. The second unit —
Literature as Biblical Exegesis, 
shifts the focus to a reading of Biblical texts in tandem with their modern literary and cinematic interpretations, focusing on 
Job 
and 
Esther
.  What, we will ask, happen to the Biblical world once it is being refracted through a modern sensibility? How can we take literature seriously as Biblical hermeneutics? The third unit —
Recent Directions, 
introduces some of the recent directions in the field, focusing on how literature imagines the relationship between Bible, archeology, and modernity, as well as on the intersection of Biblical literature, fantasy, and science fiction.",Offer Dynes,2:10pm,4:00pm,10890,,W4029-20261-001,,Slavic Languages,CLSL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLSL/W4029-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20261CLSL4029W001,SEMINAR

CLST UN3037,Writing and Power in the Roman Empire,"Despite low literacy rates in the ancient world, engagement with writing concerned all socioeconomic groups across the Roman Empire, from public documents and tax receipts to personal letters and magical spells. The Roman government placed considerable importance on the written word, a vital component to political, social, religious, economic, and cultural life, both at the center of the empire in Rome and in the provinces. Between Roman authorities and provincials, writing was used by ruler and ruled in various ways as a tool of power to exploit, secure social mobility, resist, maintain ideological power, protect, legitimize, empower, and communicate. This interdisciplinary course explores the theme of writing and power in the Roman Empire during the period of the High Empire (30 BCE to 235 CE), taking both macro and microhistorical approaches. Through close analysis of papyrus documents, inscriptions, archaeological sources, ancient histories, and coins, we will consider how power and control were exercised through and over writing, the various groups interested in the power of writing and to what ends, the elaborate system of archives imposed and maintained across the empire, Roman censorship practices, and the value of studying writing and power to the history of imperialism, provincial resistance, administration, literacy, social mobility, personal and civic identity, and culture in the Roman Empire. In addition to the capital city of Rome, we will study four eastern provinces (Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, and Syria) and two western provinces (Britain and Gaul), allowing us to consider certain power structures in both the center and periphery. We will have opportunities to visit papyrus documents at the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library in Butler as well as Greek, Roman, and Egyptian artifacts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",Susan Rahyab,11:10am,1:00pm,10739,,W3037-20261-001,Writing & Power Roman Emp,Classical Studies,CLST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLST/W3037-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261CLST3037W001,SEMINAR

COGS UN1001,Introduction to Cognitive Science,"The goal of cognitive science — and of this course — is to understand how the mind works. Trying to understand our own minds is perhaps the most ambitious and exciting (and difficult) project in all of science, and this project requires tools drawn from fields including experimental psychology, computer science and artificial intelligence, linguistics, vision science, philosophy, anthropology, behavioral economics, and several varieties of neuroscience (among others). This course will introduce you to the major tools and theories from these areas, as they relate to the study of the mind. We will employ these perspectives while exploring the nature of mental processes such as perception, reasoning, memory, attention, imagery, language, intelligence, decision-making, morality— and even attraction and love. In sum, this course will expose you to cognitive science, the assumptions on which it rests, and many of the most important and fascinating results obtained so far.",,10:10am,11:25am,00382,,W1001-20261-001,INTRO TO COGNITIVE SCIENC,Cognitive Science @Barnard,COGS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COGS/W1001-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261COGS1001W001,LECTURE

COGS UN3950,"Language, Meaning, and Mind","In little more than fifty years linguistics has shifted from philological description to a cognitive-biological quest to uncover the mind’s language faculty. This seminar traces that shift through the generative tradition, which treats language as an innate “mental organ” whose universal grammar lets children build a full syntax from sparse input. We follow Minimalism’s bold reduction: a single operation called Merge, plus a finite lexicon and two interfaces, one to articulation and one to thought, yields the “digital infinity” of human expression. Framing this architecture in evolutionary terms, we confront Darwin’s problem: did language emerge gradually for communication or erupt suddenly from pre-existing cognitive parts? Evidence from birdsong, primate calls, and gesture helps separate general performance limits from the species-specific competence that remains uniquely human. Students will practice minimalist analyses and weigh competing biolinguistic accounts, using language as a window onto the design and origin of the human mind.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,00637,,W3950-20261-001,"Language, Meaning, and Mi",Cognitive Science @Barnard,COGS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COGS/W3950-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261COGS3950W001,SEMINAR
COGS UN3951,Computational Models of Decision-Making,"We make decisions countless times a day. Computational models have been developed that improve our understanding of how these decisions are made. This course is organized in three parts: perceptual decision-making, value-based decision-making, and computational psychiatry. In part one, perceptual decision-making, we will focus on computational models that can capture and explain decisions in perception, such as categorizing an orientation, or discriminating the direction of moving dots, or estimating the magnitude of a stimulus (e.g., time). We will start by laying the foundations of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference under uncertainty and build to models that incorporate confidence ratings and reaction times. In part two, value-based decision-making, we will move on to decisions that incorporate our values (e.g., ‘Should I go out or stay in and study?’, ‘Should I eat a burger or a salad?’). We will learn the basics of a computational modeling framework that captures how we learn values from rewards and punishments, reinforcement learning, as well as about model-free and model-based learning. Lastly, we will learn how impairments in decision-making that occur in psychopathology (e.g., addiction, anorexia nervosa, anxiety) have been conceptualized and quantified in the relatively new field of computational psychiatry.",Andra L Mihali,12:10pm,2:00pm,00519,,W3951-20261-001,Comp Models of Decision-M,Cognitive Science @Barnard,COGS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COGS/W3951-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,F,20261COGS3951W001,SEMINAR

The course will be structured as a seminar, where one class is dedicated to instructor-led lecture and one to studentled discussion of papers around topics covered in the lecture. Each paper discussion will be structured as a panel of 3-4 students, each with an assigned role. Each panel role covers one aspect of critically assessing an academic/industry paper. Everyone in the class should participate by commenting and asking questions from the panel. The class is project-based, meaning there will be a semester-long project focused on evaluating LLMs and/or building LLMs around a topic/problem/task you care about, with an end of semester final paper. The projects will be done by groups of 3-4 students.

This course introduces beginning graduate students to the changing conceptions in the comparative study of literatures and societies, paying special attention to the range of interdisciplinary methods in comparative scholarship. Students are expected to have preliminary familiarity with the discipline in which they wish to do their doctoral work. Our objective is to broaden the theoretical foundation of comparative studies to negotiate a conversation between literary studies and social sciences. Weekly readings are devoted to intellectual inquiries that demonstrate strategies of research, analysis, and argumentation from a multiplicity of disciplines and fields, such as anthropology, history, literary criticism, architecture, political theory, philosophy, art history, and media studies. Whenever possible, we will invite faculty from the above disciplines and fields to visit our class and share their perspectives on assigned readings.

CPLS GR8833,LAW AND VIOLENCE: CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES,"Law is often considered to be the opposite of violence: Promising to deliver us from the cycles of violence preceding its arrival, it sets its task as the establishment of a normative order that sanctions arbitrary and illegitimate uses of violence, derives its legitimacy from our consent, and guarantees formal equality to everyone under its rule. Various critics have challenged this conventional understanding of law, however, and examined the numerous ways in which law finds itself entangled with the very violence that it aims to combat. They have pointed out how the enforcement of law often entails the use of coercion and force, that legal decisions involve legitimations of state violence, and that the provision of rights often goes hand in hand with the entrenchment of social inequality and domination.
  
 
  
Taking Walter Benjamin’s “Critique of Violence” as a focal point, this course examines a wide range of critical perspectives on the relationship between law and violence. Following our study of Benjamin, we turn to the deconstructionist perspectives represented by Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler. Then we move to the biopolitical critique developed by Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, and Roberto Esposito. Following these continental perspectives, we turn to the American scene and read the criticisms developed by Robert Cover as well as Critical Legal Studies (e.g., Duncan Kennedy, Roberto Unger) and Critical Race Theory (e.g., Derrick Bell, Patricia Williams). In the final section, we examine three thinkers who strive to chart a path beyond the impasses we studied and navigate the aporias arising from law’s entanglement with violence (albeit in very different ways): Hannah Arendt, Jürgen Habermas, and Christoph Menke.",Ayten Gundogdu,4:10pm,6:00pm,10979,,G8833-20261-001,LAW/VIOLENCE: CRITICAL PE,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLS/G8833-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20261CPLS8833G001,SEMINAR

CPLS GU4802,Contradictions of Care: From Intimacy to,"Care is central to the interpersonal claim that is made by the other. It is a response that recognizes and satisfies a need. Care can be motivated by pain and sorrow, but also by desire and the desire for recognition. But while care is a fundamental aspect of healing, it can also be a demand that extracts obligations and liabilities. Care is an ambiguous concept that always already contains or is determined by its oppositions; we will begin by analyzing the concept of care itself, drawing on resources from the history and philosophy of medicine as well as literary sources. Ideals of care that many of us have for our loved ones are difficult to render at scale, and are often in tension with the for-profit motivations behind the development of medications, the administration of healthcare services, and the distribution of goods. We will consider the sorts of compromises that are made every day through readings in literature, history, political science and philosophy and also through first-person experience in the form of a practicum that that will run parallel to the course.",Arden A Hegele,10:10am,12:00pm,10981,,W4802-20261-001,CONTRADICTIONS OF CARE,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLS/W4802-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261CPLS4802W001,SEMINAR

CPLT BC3145,DERRIDA & LITERATURE,"Jacques Derrida was one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century and his impact on literary studies was enormously significant. The objective of this course is to take stock of Derrida’s contribution to literature, and to do so by assessing the intricate relations he establishes between literature, philosophy, economic and political theory, gender studies, translation studies, postcolonial theory, and theology. The course is divided into six parts. Part 1 introduces Derrida’s approach to ‘deconstruction,’ particularly as regards his engagement with the fundamental concepts of Western thought and the importance he confers upon the notion of ‘writing’ itself. Part 2 examines Derrida’s autobiographical texts wherein he positions himself as a subject for deconstruction, interrogating his own gender, his sense of being an organic, creaturely life-form, the relationship he has to his own language, and the matter of his identity as French, but also as Algerian, and Jewish. While the majority of the Derrida texts we will be reading are excerpts from larger works or short essays and interviews, in this section we will read a full-length text – 
Monolingualism of the Other
 – so that we can trace Derrida’s train of thought from beginning to end. In Part 3 we will use an interview conducted by Derek Attridge, “This Strange Institution Called Literature,” as a template for thinking about Derrida’s relation to literature, and in Part 4 we will read our second full-length text by Derrida, namely 
Given Time 1: Counterfeit Money
, an in-depth analysis of a prose poem by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. Part 5 considers an aspect of Derrida’s work that reveals the extent of his embrace of provisional, in-between positions for thought in general, and for literary texts in particular, namely translation. For deconstruction is keenly invested in words beginning with ‘trans’: transposition, transplant, trans-valuation, and indeed trans-gender. Translation provides Derrida with a scenario whereby crossings and transits can be imagined – for literary texts, and for identities that wish to remain un-determined by fixed poles or normative values. The course finishes with an assessment of Derrida’s reflections on death, mourning, and the matter of leaving a legacy. In Part 6, we therefore read more of the essay “Living On,” and also Derrida’s final interview, “Learning to Live, F",Brian D O'Keeffe,4:10pm,5:25pm,00724,,X3145-20261-001,,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3145-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261CPLT3145X001,LECTURE

CPLT BC3205,Resonance: Poetry and the Education of t,"That modern life has been shaped by forces of commercial, technological, and social acceleration since the Industrial Revolution is by now a commonplace.  Such forces have disrupted and transformed natural and traditional communal rhythms all around the world.  Already in England in 1800, the Romantic poet William Wordsworth was cognizant of such processes.  He wrote of “the multitude of causes acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind,” among them “the great national events which are daily taking place, and the increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies.”  Over 200 years later, the sociologist Hartmut Rosa has analysed the escalatory pace of capitalist modernity and the dependence of our techno-commercial global system on constant change for, paradoxically, its very stability.  “If acceleration is the problem,” he diagnoses, “then resonance may well be the solution.”
  
            In this course, we turn to poetry for lessons in resonance. As an art of repetition, poetry is  at heart an art of resonance.  As an art of memory that relies on techniques of repetition in formal patterning, poetry may awaken readers and listeners to their own resonant interiority, to structures of continuity and events of discontinuity in the experience of time, meaning, and meaningfulness.  Poetry may open up and refine our capacity to resonate with others, be they familiars or strangers, with suppleness, tact, and complexity.  Putting the sociologist’s hypothesis to the test of poetry, we will investigate how poetry may teach us by aesthetic means how to get in sync with ourselves and others in a world that often feels radically out of sync.
  
            In this investigation, we will turn to texts of British and European Romanticism as points of departure, studying how the very status of poetry and poetic language underwent radical redefinition in the knowledge system of late eighteenth-century Europe, with repercussions in a complex, shared global history.  We will pay especial attention to the oeuvre of William Wordsworth, which repeatedly features scenes of listening and allegorizes effects of resonance with autobiographi",Emily Sun,10:10am,11:25am,00906,,X3205-20261-001,Resonance: Listening to P,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3205-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261CPLT3205X001,LECTURE

CPLT BC3510,ADVANCED WORKSHOP TRANSLA,"Maurice Blanchot once described translators as the “hidden masters of culture.” Indeed, though our labor and craft often go unrecognized in the age of Google Translate, translators play an essential role as tastemakers, bridge-builders, advocates, and diplomats, not to mention the most intimate readers and re-writers of literature. In this workshop, we will explore translation as a praxis of writing, reading, and revision. Together, we will also interrogate translation's complex and often fraught role in cultural production. What ethical questions does translation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated? What is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation teach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will include selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary translations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and memoir. Students will workshop original translations into English and complete brief writing and translation exercises throughout.",,12:10pm,2:00pm,00300,,X3510-20261-001,,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3510-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261CPLT3510X001,WORKSHOP
CPLT BC3552,The Arabic Novel,"The novel in Arabic literature has often been the place where every attempt to look within ends up involving the need to contend with or measure the self against the European, the dominant culture. This took various forms. From early moments of easy-going and confident cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to later author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines between west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern phenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation, for bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq—the man credited with being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great translator—called ‘disjunction’. We will begin with his satirical, deeply inventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a book with an insatiable appetite for definitions and comparisons, with Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an abiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges) and with locating and often subverting moments of connection and disconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present, where we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic, from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine. We will read them chronologically, starting with Leg Over Leg (1855) and finishing with Minor Detail, a novel that was only published last year.  Obviously, this does not claim to be a comprehensive survey; for that we would need several years and even then, we would fall short. Instead, the hope is that it will be a thrilling journey through some of the most facinating fiction ever written.

We begin with a brief overview of the history of the field, and then we’ll focus primarily on the range of modes in which its interdisciplinary work has been undertaken (literary, historical, legal, digital, etc.). The idea here is not to arrive a comprehensive picture of American Studies, but to think about the many ways people have produced knowledge under its aegis. We will also focus on work by Columbia faculty, and sessions of the course are built around visits by faculty in the field to Columbia’s University Seminar in American Studies. Our guiding questions include: How does one do research in a multimedia, “cultural” environment? How does one situate oneself as an “intellectual” or “critic” in relation to one’s object of study? How does one write about different media/genres? How does one incorporate different methodologies into one research project?",Matthew Sandler,2:10pm,4:00pm,11415,,G5000-20261-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/G5000-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261CSER5000G001,SEMINAR

CSER GU4340,"Visionary Medicine: Racial Justice, Heal","In Fall 2014, medical students across the U.S. staged die-ins as part of the nationwide #blacklivesmatter protests. The intention was to create a shocking visual spectacle, laying on the line “white coats for black lives.” The images were all over social media: students of all colors, dressed in lab coats, lying prone against eerily clean tile floors, stethoscopes in pockets, hands and around necks. One prone student held a sign reading, “Racism is Real.” These medical students’ collective protests not only created visual spectacle, but produced a dynamic speculative fiction. What would it mean if instead of Michael Brown or Eric Garner or Freddie Gray, these other, more seemingly elite bodies were subjected to police violence? In another viral image, a group of African American male medical students from Harvard posed wearing hoodies beneath their white coats, making clear that the bodies of some future doctors could perhaps be more easily targeted for state-sanctioned brutality. “They tried to bury us,” read a sign held by one of the students, “they didn’t realize we were seeds.” Both medicine and racial justice are acts of speculation; their practices are inextricable from the practice of imagining. By imagining new cures, new discoveries and new futures for human beings in the face of illness, medicine is necessarily always committing acts of speculation. By imagining ourselves into a more racially just future, by simply imagining ourselves any sort of future in the face of racist erasure, social justice activists are similarly involved in creating speculative fictions. This course begins with the premise that racial justice is the bioethical imperative of our time. It will explore the space of science fiction as a methodology of imagining such just futures, embracing the work of Asian- and Afroturism, Cosmos Latinos and Indigenous Imaginaries. We will explore issues including Biocolonialism, Alien/nation, Transnational Labor and Reproduction, the Borderlands and Other Diasporic Spaces. This course will be seminar-style and will make central learner participation and presentation. The seminar will be inter-disciplinary, drawing from science and speculative fictions, cultural studies, gender studies, narrative medicine, disability studies, and bioethics.

CSER GU4350,CINEMA OF SUBVERSION,"Russian filmmaker Andre Tarkovsky said that “the artist has no right to an idea in which he is not socially committed.” Argentine filmmaker Fernando Solanas and Spanish-born Octavio Getino postulated an alternative cinema that would spur spectators to political action. In this course we will ask the question: How do authoritarian governments influence the arts, and how do artists respond? We will study how socially committed filmmakers have subverted and redefined cinema aesthetics to challenge authoritarianism and repression. In addition, we will look at how some filmmakers respond to institutional oppression, such as poverty and corruption, even within so-called “free” societies. The focus is on contemporary filmmakers but will also include earlier classics of world cinema to provide historical perspective. The course will discuss these topics, among others: What is authoritarianism, what is totalitarianism, and what are the tools of repression within authoritarian/totalitarian societies? What is Third Cinema, and how does it represent and challenge authoritarianism? How does film navigate the opposition of censorship, propaganda and truth? How do filmmakers respond to repressive laws concerning gender and sexual orientation? How do they deal with violence and trauma? How are memories of repressive regimes reflected in the psyche of modern cinema?

DNCE BC3338,CONTACT IMPROVISATION,"Prerequisites: Limited to twenty people. Examination of the gender-neutral partnering technique that is now common in contemporary dance. Focus is placed on recent improvisatory forms, sensation building, center connection and risk. Emphasis is placed on listening and sensing rather than controlling or leading.
  
This course will introduce the exploration of a partnering technique that is enriching for the mind and body. Contact Improvisation is not only an important tool for the dancer as it informs the body how to move with weight and connection and is required by most contemporary styles – it is also a technique that informs the artist in us all as it emphasizes listening, trust, and spontaneous creativity. In this course, students will use contact to support the creation of most duets, trios, and larger group dance.   Focus is placed on recent improvisatory forms, sensation building, center connection, and finding the safe edges of risk as well as applying these studies to creation and expression. Students in this course will explore their own weight and how it relates to other bodies by listening as well as employing emotional, psychological, and cultural structures to their improvisation. Emphasis is placed on listening and sensation rather than controlling or leading. Students will explore the dynamic ride and risk taking of improvisation and trusting another body by giving and taking weight.

DROM B7106,Operations Strategy,"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,"" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, ""Firm Boundaries,"" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, ""Internal Operations,"" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, ""New Challenges,"" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.""",Medini Singh,,,14341,,B7106-20261-001,,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B7106-20261-001/,,In-Person,"Business

DROM B8102,Process Improvement and Growth,"This class brings business operations and management science classes to the field with real-world experience. Through experiential learning, we will bridge the gap between theory and practice with international case discussions, conversations with guest speakers and hands-on company sponsored projects. Different to most classes in the school, in this class students will be exposed to a series of international cases and examples based on medium-sized, fast-growing entrepreneurial ventures. Each session will also include a guest speaker, often times the protagonist of the case studied, giving the students the opportunity to learn directly from successful entrepreneurs and senior executives.
Additionally, students will put into practice the concept of process improvement by working on a company-sponsored applied project. Teams of 4-5 people, 3-4 MBA/EMBA students and 1-2 engineering (SEAS) students, will work hand in hand with the instructors and company representatives to achieve company goals. For example, teams may be tasked with re-designing the logistical strategy of distribution of the company to get rid of inefficiencies, or identify and find strategies to eliminate areas of waste within the companies’ processes, or analyze customer feedback and design operational solutions to increase customer satisfaction, etc.

DROM B8103,Business Analytics II: Foundations of AI,"Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises such as businesses, non-profits, and governments use data to gain insights and make better decisions. Business analytics is applied in operations, marketing, finance, and strategic planning among other functions. Modern data collection methods – arising in bioinformatics, mobile platforms, and previously unanalyzable data like text and images – are leading an explosive growth in the volume of data available for decision making. The ability to use data effectively to drive rapid, precise, and profitable decisions has been a critical strategic advantage for companies as diverse as Walmart, Google, Capital One, and Disney. Many startups are based on the application of AI & analytics to large databases.

Sustainability encompasses not only the environmental footprint of an organization but also the way in which firms treat workers and customers both within their firm and supply chain network. Understanding the role of operational excellence and strategic supply chain management in achieving sustainability is critical for effective leadership.
 
 This course examines a variety of approaches to designing sustainability into an organization’s operations and how to measure and reduce a firm’s operational environmental impact. We also explore themes of risk, accountability, and sustainability within global supply chains. What challenges do firms face in being socially responsible when managing globally distributed supply chains? Three themes comprise this course: (1) designing sustainable operations, (2) drivers and consequences of sustainability, and (3) global sourcing and social responsibility.
 
 • Designing Sustainable Operations. Sample cases include – REI Rentals, All Birds, IndigoAg, Supply Chain Hubs in Humanitarian Logistics.
 • Drivers and Consequences of Sustainability. Sample cases include – Fiji Water, Aspen Ski Company.

DROM B8125,DIGITAL LITERACY-DECISION MKRS,"COURSE DESCRIPTION
Unrelenting technological progress demands entrepreneurs, executives, and managers to continually upgrade their skills in the pursuit of emerging opportunities. As “software eats the world”, executives from all industries are increasingly called upon to be “Full Stack”: capable of making competent decisions across domains as diverse as digital technology, design, product, and marketing.
In this course, we begin with primers on code, design, and product management. Once the foundation is laid, we examine the best practices for building great products and exceptional teams. We conclude with an overview of how technology is changing the way products are marketed, distributed, and monetized. Our goal is to equip “non-technical” executives with the terminology, tools, and context required to effect change in a software­ and internet-driven world.
COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES
To provide an understanding of the technologies that we encounter everyday, and how history can inform the technology decisions executives face today.
To become familiar the concepts that underpin modern computer programming, empowering managers to engage with engineers credibly and confidently.
To shed light on the processes and tools designers use to solve user-facing design and architecture challenges.
To clarify what product managers do, walk through the nitty-gritty of managing software development, and equip executives with the best practices for evaluating and improving their products.
To prepare managers to identify, recruit, and nurture the technical talent they will need to succeed in today’s highly competitive labor market.
To familiarize students with the dynamic context in which technology products live, ensuring the profitable and widespread delivery of those products.",Marco A Morales Barba,9:00am,12:15pm,14668,,B8125-20261-001,DIGITAL LITERACY-DECISION,"Decision, Risk and Operations",DROM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DROM/B8125-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

DROM B8126,Programming Generative AI Applications,"Generative Artificial Intelligence is a type of AI that learns patterns from data to create new content in various types of media (text, images, audio, video). At its heart a generative AI system has a large language model (LLM) that is essentially a large (trillions of parameters) neural network that has been trained on a mix of vast amounts of data as well as human input. Applying generative AI to actual problems in business often requires that the LLM underlying the AI be customized to the business problem, either by attaching a data source (e.g., operating procedures, 10k reports, marketing plans, balance sheets, etc.) to the LLM (a process known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG) or by retraining the neural net with additional data (a process known as fine tuning). adjusting the parameters of the underlying LLM. Embedding generative AI into organizational processes requires
 that we gather appropriate data and reprogram the LLM to use the data either through RAG or fine tuning.
  
The focus of this course is to give you a working knowledge of what it takes to customize and assemble a customized generative AI application. We will use OpenAI’s GPT as our base model and learn how to build a RAG and how to customize using simple fine tuning. About 50% of the class time will be devoted to a group project where you will, in small groups, build your own customized AI application. All programming will be in Python and we will use libraries like tensorflow, langchain and faiss.

The course is focused on innovative business models of early to mid-stage healthcare services companies (payers, providers, HCIT firms) that improve quality of patient care, lower costs, and facilitate access to such services, as well as the opportunities and challenges of early-stage biotechnology companies discovering and developing novel compounds. It considers how investors and entrepreneurs can assess, value and manage the inherent risks to succeed in this large, complex, and dynamic sector. This course will address these issues through a mixture of lectures, case studies, and guest speakers (investors and entrepreneurs) from the healthcare sector. Note: Some understanding and prior experience in the healthcare/pharma industry will be highly useful. Students need to attend the first class session to understand material covered later in the course. Evaluation is 25% class participation, 25% mid-term assignment (short paper on questions or case study), and 50% final (individual) paper.

The goal of this course is to provide students with a basic knowledge of how to perform some more advanced statistical methods useful in answering policy questions using observational or experimental data. It will also allow them to more critically review research published that claims to answer causal policy questions. The primary focus is on the challenge of answering causal questions that take the form “Did A cause B?” using data that do not conform to a perfectly controlled randomized study. Examples from real policy studies and quantitative program evaluations will be used throughout the course to illustrate key ideas and methods.
  
First, we will explore how best to design a study to answer causal questions given the logistical and ethical constraints that exist. We will consider both experimental and quasi-experimental (observational studies) research designs, and then discuss several approaches to drawing causal inferences from observational studies including propensity score matching, interrupted time series designs, instrumental variables, difference in differences, fixed effects models, and regression discontinuity designs.
  
As this course will focus on quantitative methods, a strong understanding of multivariate regression analysis is a prerequisite for the material covered.

(Note: macroeconomic topics and forecasting methods are not covered.)
  
The central objective is to train students to be effective analysts and policy researchers. Key questions include: Given the available data, what analysis best informs the policy question? How should we design research, prepare data, and implement statistical methods using R? How can we assess causal effects of policies rather than mere correlations? What ethical considerations arise when working with data on marginalized populations?
  
Students will learn through hands-on analysis of datasets tied to a range of policy issues, including: caste-based expenditure gaps in India, racial disparities in NYPD fare evasion enforcement, water shutoffs in Detroit, Village Fund grants in Indonesia, public health insurance and child mortality, and Stand Your Ground laws and gun violence.

DVGO IA7580,Managing Humanitarian Emergencies,"According to the 2025 Global Humanitarian Overview, humanitarian partners are appealing for over US$47 billion to assist nearly 190 million people facing life-threatening and urgent needs across 72 countries. These staggering numbers are fueled by drivers such as conflicts and political instability, climate change, disease outbreaks, poverty, and natural hazards. Together, these drivers have deepened pre-existing vulnerabilities, resulting in unprecedented need. They have also prompted humanitarians to address the accountability challenges and inequities deeply seated within the aid system.
  
Humanitarian agencies strive to meet rising needs, but the task that confronts them is immense. 
Funding
 for humanitarian responses is not keeping pace with requirements: although donors contribute more, the amounts are not commensurate with needs. Beyond financing, donor policies and politics challenge agencies' ability to deliver. The safety and security of aid workers is increasingly under threat.
  
This course focuses on the management of humanitarian operations and intends to provide students with the opportunity to explore critical issues in the humanitarian system. It helps students understand debates in the humanitarian system, develop a framework of analysis they can use in headquarters and the field, and acquire a toolkit to help them succeed as aid workers. This practical course will interest those wishing to work with an aid agency, directly or indirectly with disaster-affected populations, or those who want to better understand the system and the opportunities and challenges that humanitarians face.",Pierrette Quintiliani,,,10191,,U7580-20261-001,Managing Humanitarian Eme,Development and Governance,DVGO,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DVGO/U7580-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261DVGO7580U001,SEMINAR
DVGO IA7590,Humanitarian Crisis Simulation,"This short course is designed to enable participating students to weigh and apply humanitarian principles, concepts, best practices, and minimum standards to a simulated humanitarian emergency response. The simulation exercise challenges student participants with issues and dilemmas confronting humanitarian practitioners when responding to a complex emergency, and inspires them to work within the humanitarian system and architecture to solve problems in creative ways
  
In their roles as staff of humanitarian response agencies charged with responding to a large-scale crisis, student participants will analyze a dynamic stream of assessment data, prioritize key humanitarian needs, and make critical decisions about the appropriate type and scale of needed interventions. Participants will also be introduced to the importance and mechanisms of international humanitarian coordination in assembling the response. 
  
The simulation will include a day-long exercise followed by a day of debriefing, analysis, and identification of key challenges and lessons. The Humanitarian Crisis Simulation focuses on humanitarian operations from the perspective of humanitarian assistance agencies operating in the field. The course should, therefore, be of interest to those wishing to work with humanitarian agencies responsible for planning and conducting responses to vulnerable populations affected by disaster, or to those who want to better understand the humanitarian assistance system and the challenges confronting humanitarian decision-makers.",Jeffrey Klenk,,,14305,,U7590-20261-001,Humanitarian Crisis Simul,Development and Governance,DVGO,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DVGO/U7590-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1,,,20261DVGO7590U001,SEMINAR

DVGO IA7845,"Gender, Politics, and Development","Gender equality, and the empowerment of women and girls, are now widely accepted as development goals in their own right and as essential to inclusive and sustainable development. Yet despite progress in many areas, gender gaps and discrimination persist. This course asks: How did gender equality move from the periphery to the center of development discourse, and what difference has this shift made? Is gender equality a human right, an essential dimension of human development, or “smart economics”? What are the implications of a gender equality agenda for men and boys, and for broader understandings of gender identities and sexualities? What policies, strategies, and practices have been effective—or ineffective—in narrowing gender gaps and improving outcomes for both women and men in different development settings? What are possible responses to the “gender backlash” emerging in some countries and institutions?
  
In this course, we approach gender, politics, and development through theory, policy, and practice. We explore multiple constructions of gender in development discourse; the intersection of gender with race, ethnicity, caste, class, sexual orientation, disability, and other social categories; and the influence of dominant economic and political trends. We examine how gender norms shape the approaches of governments, development agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.
  
A critical gender lens is applied to a wide range of development sectors and issues, including economic development, political participation, education and health, environment and climate change, and conflict and displacement. The course also considers current debates and approaches related to gender mainstreaming and gender metrics in development practice. Students engage with the material through class discussions, exercises, case studies, and the development of a gender-related project proposal.",,,,10193,,U7845-20261-001,"Gender, Politics, & Devel",Development and Governance,DVGO,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DVGO/U7845-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261DVGO7845U001,SEMINAR

These include liberal and authoritarian internationalism, collective security through the League Covenant and the United Nations Charter, John Rawls’s 
Law of Peoples
, and various other contemporary models of international law, global governance networks, and global democratization.

For the ensuing few weeks, we will cover the core biophysical requirements for food production: soil and land, water and climate, and genetic resources. We include an introduction to human nutrition – 
Nutrition Week
 – that focuses on dietary change and food-based solutions to malnutrition. Building on this, the course will survey a selection of important food systems and trends across Asia, Africa, and Latin America that provide food security and livelihoods for more than half of the world’s population. Case studies and classroom debates throughout the course will explore the roles of science, technology, policies, politics, institutions, business, finance, aid, trade, and human behavior in advancing sustainable agriculture, and achieving food and nutritional security. We will probe the interactions of food systems with global issues including poverty and inequality, the persistence of chronic hunger and malnutrition, climate change, environmental degradation, international food business and value chains, biotechnology (GMOs), post-harvest losses, and food waste. With a sharp eye for credible evidence, we will confront controversies, reflect on historical trends, identify common myths, and surface little-known but important truths about agriculture and food systems.

ECON BC3081,Economics of Work and Play,"In 1930 Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by the 21st century because he expected we would be at the foothills of the ""economic promised land."" He was more than right about technological progress and staggering productivity growth –– but dead wrong about the role work would play in our lives. Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions. 
  
 
  
This course is centered on the concept of ""work."" The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing. 
  
 
  
We begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge –– for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes ""work activity"" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of ""man"" and ""work.”
  
 
  
The course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market “facts” that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close ""exegesis"" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.",Lalith Munasinghe,4:10pm,5:25pm,00859,,X3081-20261-001,Economics of Work and Pla,Economics @Barnard,ECON,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/X3081-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ECON3081X001,LECTURE

ECON GU4230,ECONOMICS OF NEW YORK CITY,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and STAT Un1201 This course takes New York as our laboratory. Economics is about individual choice subject to constraints and the ways that choices sum up to something often much more than the parts. The fundamental feature of any city is the combination of those forces that bring people together and those that push them apart. Thus both physical and social space will be central to our discussions. The underlying theoretical and empirical analysis will touch on spatial aspects of urban economics, regional, and even international economics. We will aim to see these features in New York City taken as a whole, as well as in specific neighborhoods of the city. We will match these theoretical and empirical analyses with readings that reflect close observation of specific subjects. The close observation is meant to inspire you to probe deeply into a topic in order that the tools and approaches of economics may illuminate these issues in a fresh way.",Donald R Davis,2:40pm,3:55pm,12844,,W4230-20261-001,ECONOMICS OF NYC,Economics,ECON,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/W4230-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

In broad terms, labor economics is the study of the exchange of labor services for wages—a category that takes in a wide range of topics. Our objective in this course is to lay the foundations for explaining labor market phenomena within an economic framework and subsequently apply this knowledge-structure to a select set of questions. Throughout this process we will discuss empirical research, which will highlight the power (as well as the limitations) of employing economic models to real-world problems.

Globalization has the potential for enormous gains but is also associated to serious risks. The gains are related to international commerce where the industrial countries dominate, while the risks involve the global environment, poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs that affect in great measure the developing nations. Both are linked to a historical division of the world into the North and the South-the industrial and the developing nations. Key to future evolution are (1) the creation of new markets that trade privately produced public goods, such as knowledge and greenhouse gas emissions, as in the Kyoto Protocol; (2) the updating of the Breton Woods Institutions, including the creation of a Knowledge Bank and an International Bank for Environmental Settlements.",Graciela Chichilnisky,5:40pm,6:55pm,12857,,W4750-20261-001,,Economics,ECON,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/W4750-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

This workshop may only be taken by students applying for departmental honors, and it also fulfills the economics seminar requirement for the economics major and all joint majors. Students must see the director during mid-semester registration in the spring to discuss their proposed thesis topic, at which time they will be matched with appropriate faculty who will act as their thesis adviser. Students will meet their adviser over the course of the year at mutually agreed upon times. A rough draft of the thesis will be due during the first week of February in the spring semester, and the final draft will be due three weeks before the last day of classes.

Next, we consider the ways in which the subjective experience of gender and sexuality in schools is often overlooked or inadequately theorized. Exploring the ways that race, class, citizenship, religion and other categories of identity intersect with gender and sexuality, we give primacy to the contention that subjectivity is historically complex, and does not adhere to the analytically distinct identity categories we might try to impose on it.",Ileana Jimenez,2:10pm,4:00pm,00388,,X3042-20261-001,GENDER SEXUALITY AND SCHOOL,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3042-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261EDUC3042X001,SEMINAR

Throughout the semester, we will work to “complicate class”, reconsidering what class is, why class matters, and how we can best think about the relationship between social class and schooling. You will develop a language for talking about class, considering the affordances and constraints of various conceptions of class. You will also leave with critical questions about the possibilities and limitations of relying on schools as a solution to social problems. Recognizing restraints, we will conclude by reflecting on how we might work toward creating more equitable learning environments for poor and working-class students.",Rachel Throop,12:00pm,1:50pm,00389,,X3045-20261-001,EDUCATION & LIMITS EQUITY,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3045-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261EDUC3045X001,SEMINAR

EDUC BC3068,"Education, Crisis and Futures","Education is a social project of making futures. It is a field where people imagine selves and worlds to come
 while navigating current constraints and past legacies. Even in the face of various crises that disrupt
 educational systems globally, education is often understood as a crisis response and charged with the task of
 forging alternative futures and driving social and economic progress.
 In this course, we will interrogate the politics of crisis and futurity in education. First, we will explore how
 notions of crisis are mobilized to define problems and solutions in education research and policy. In this
 exploration, we will ask how histories and politics of domination along lines of race, class, gender, and other
 social categories are articulated or silenced in discourses of educational crisis. We will attend to how crises
 create both danger and opportunity by considering how they serve to justify violent, dispossessive restructuring
 and how they lay bare structures of inequality in ways that generate collective action and transformation.
 Next, we will Interrogate education’s futural orientations. We will probe familiar progress narratives and explore
 what roles education plays in shaping how marginalized communities imagine and enact futures beyond the
 status quo, attending to both its affordances and limitations. Throughout the course, we will draw on
 speculative fiction and on scholarship in anthropology, Black studies, and comparative education to investigate
 the politics of crisis and futurity in diverse educational contexts. We will engage study as speculative practice
 through collaborative and independent exercises that invite us to develop praxes for just futures of education.",Amelia S Herbert,11:00am,12:50pm,00395,,X3068-20261-001,"Education, Crisis and Fut",Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3068-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261EDUC3068X001,SEMINAR

EEEB GU4055,PRINCIPLES & APPS MOD DNA SEQUENCING TEC,"Prerequisites: An introductory biology course or instructor permission Genome sequencing, the technology used to translate DNA into data, is now a fundamental tool in biological and biomedical research, and is expected to revolutionize many related fields and industries in coming years as the technology becomes faster, smaller, and less expensive. Learning to use and interpret genomic information, however, remains challenging for many students, as it requires synthesizing knowledge from a range of disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Although genomics is of broad interest to many fields, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, medicine, and computer science, students in these areas often lack sufficient background training to take a genomics course. This course bridges this gap, by teaching skills in modern genomic technologies that will allow students to innovate and effectively apply these tools in novel applications across disciplines. To achieve this, we implement an active learning approach to emphasize genomics as a data science, and use this organizing principle to structure the course around computational exercises, lab-based activities using state-of-the-art sequencing instruments,case studies, and field work. Together, this approach will introduce students to the principles of genomics by allowing them to generate, analyze, and interpret data hands-on while using the most cutting-edge genomic technologies of today in a stimulating and engaging learning experience.",Andres Bendesky,1:10pm,2:25pm,13238,,W4055-20261-001,PRINCIPLES & APPS MOD DNA,"Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology",EEEB,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EEEB/W4055-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261EEEB4055W001,LECTURE

EESC BC3020,Environmental Security,"Course Overview/Short Description
 This course will consider various ways that changing environmental conditions put stress on humans and our societies and political systems, with an emphasis on conditions in the Global South. Among other topics it will consider influences of climate change on violent conflict migration and impacts of heat and air pollution on human health and wellbeing. Students will develop data analysis skills to explore these relationships and complete projects on environmental security cases and questions of their own choosing.
 
 
Longer Description/Purpose/Intention of the Course
 Variation and shifts in environmental conditions have challenged societies throughout human history. Today, climatic variability and change, along with resource extraction, pollution and other forms of environmental degradation, influence society in myriad ways, through water resources and agriculture, storms, sea level rise, and direct impacts of heat on living things, among others. Moreover, different human populations, across race, ethnicity, class, gender, age, occupation and other lines face different levels of exposure and vulnerability to climatic and other environmental stressors and tend to experience them inequitably. Students will consider the influence and disparate impacts of environmental conditions on human security, through pathways such as human health, food and water security and education; various sectors of the economy from agriculture to mining to manufacturing; governance and social capacities; and broader social and political conditions like conflict, leadership change and migration. We will also consider the various approaches humans are taking to adapt to these stressors, mitigate their harms and build resilience. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on how natural and social scientists studying these phenomena engage in the research process to learn about and detect these impacts and the disparities among them.
 
 This is a highly collaborative and project-based course that aims to offer students the power to choose the resources they want to use and the topics and cases they want to study. There will be no exams, outside of possible brief quizzes to determine whether students are engaging with the course material.

EESC GU4330,TERRESTRIAL PALEOCLIMATE - From Science,"The ‘Terrestrial Paleoclimate-From Science to Justice' course teaches the close relation and inter-connections between paleoclimate processes, modern climate impacts and solution ideas, and the resulting climate justice challenge.
  
The course starts with an introduction of the inter-hemispheric patterns of climate changes on glacial-interglacial, millennial and centennial time-scales. We introduce the most prominent and robust climate archives - ice cores, speleothems, mountain glaciers, lake cores and pluvial lakes -, ranging from the polar regions to the tropics- and discuss the methods used to precisely date these records and the various techniques to extract the wealth of climatic information these archives contain.
  
We focus on the paleoclimate signals from the last glacial cycle, its termination and transition towards the current interglacial, the Holocene period, including the last millennium. This is a climate concept course and the overarching goal will be to highlight the striking harmony of inter-hemispheric climate changes over this period and the inter-connectivity of the various key-elements of the climate system in light of the profound relevance of these climate orchestrations to ongoing climate change. 
  
In the second module of this course, we will discuss the state of the climate crises in the paleo-context, together with ideas and visions toward 
transitions
 to a more sustainable future, and the fundamental aspects of 
Climate Justice
 within these considerations. The final group project brings together all these aspects.
  
The course consists of formal lectures and discussion groups to recite and digest the new material, solve small problems and understand the connection to current climate events, solutions and Climate Justice.

Classes will be taught by a combination of lecture, readings, and case. Each class will address policy, technical, and managerial challenges for a particular domain of practice from the introduction or use of established and leading-edge information and communication technologies (ICTs), among them cloud, mobile and social. Arenas may include, for example, health, education, energy, economic development, transportation, civic engagement, law enforcement, human resources, social services, transportation, or compliance and regulatory affairs. The cases will involve a variety of managerial dilemmas and decisions, from governance to transparency, performance management to project management, and be generalizable across multiple domains, arenas, and technologies. Our goal is to expose students to the broadest range of policy challenges, and technologies comprising ICTs in use in the principal domains of practice, giving students a comprehensive exposure to the issues and opportunities as managers encounter them today - and will in the very near future.

EMPA IA6425,Communicating in Organizations,"Communicating in Organizations is a survey course that explores aspects of day-to-day managerial communication relating to presentations and other high-profile moments and more familiar elements of interpersonal communication. The course uses many teaching techniques: short lectures, individual and group exercises, video-recorded presentations, role plays, case discussions, video clips, and writing assignments. It is highly experiential, with exercises or presentations scheduled in most sessions. Initially, we’ll focus on the communication skills and strategies that help you present your ideas to others.  I’ll ask you to do two benchmark assignments―a letter and a brief presentation―to assess the abilities you bring to the course. In several of our class sessions, you’ll be the one “in front of the room,” delivering either a prepared talk or brief, impromptu comments. Such assignments will allow you to develop your skills as a presenter.  I’ll also discuss the link between listening and speaking, showing you how developing your listening skills will improve your effectiveness as a speaker.  And we’ll explore several elements of visual communication, including how to design effective visual aids and written documents. To communicate effectively in such roles as coach, interviewer, negotiator, or facilitator, you need to be skilled at listening, questioning, observing behavior, and giving feedback.  We’ll practice each of these skills in-class exercises and assignments. The Social Style instrument will provide detailed feedback about how others view your communication style. You’ll discover how style differences may lead to miscommunication, missed opportunities, or mishandled conflict.",Joann P Baney,,,12507,,U6425-20261-001,Communicating in Organiza,EXECUTIVE MPA,EMPA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EMPA/U6425-20261-001/,,In-Person,"Architecture

ENFL BC3001,BLACK SPECULATIVE FICTION,"Black Speculative Fiction encompasses a whole range of Black subgenres from Science Fiction and Fantasy to Horror and Afrofuturism. For the duration of this course, we will attempt to begin the work of extrapolating the function of Blackness within these various genres—interrogating which syntactical elements are required to label a piece of fiction “Black” and how Blackness informs genre. Through formal analysis of texts and the application of various theories presented in class, we’ll begin to understand how Blackness moves through genre to understand its relationship to the world and in some cases, to the artform itself. We will look at various texts: Film, Television, Prose, and Music. By looking across genres, we will be able to honor the inherent intertextuality of Black work and the constant inter-discursive work done across genre, text, and time. Whether a critique of structural anti-Blackness writ large, an expression of the complexity of the positionality of Black persons, or a statement of the function of Blackness, these texts make a case for the theoretical rigor and provocative discourses that lies at the heart of Black Speculative Fiction.",Danielle T Douge,2:10pm,5:55pm,00077,,X3001-20261-001,,Film @Barnard,ENFL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENFL/X3001-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20261ENFL3001X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC1045,Ghost Stories,"What are ghosts? Why are we haunted by them? And why are we so drawn to telling stories about these hauntings? In this class, we will read ghost stories from the 17th century through the present day; in the process, we will examine what these stories reveal about our own preoccupations, fears, and desires. Writers and readers turn to ghost stories for horror and suspense, for sure, but also because they’re a powerful medium for reckoning with history and memory—with the past’s hold over the present—particularly when it comes to violence, loss, oppression, and trauma. Ghost stories engage with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; with social otherness; with marginalization. Ghost stories stage problems of justice, vengeance, and guilt. Ghost stories trouble the nature of the body, and the meaning of (and boundaries between) life and death. Ghost stories lend themselves both to fear and to laughter, both to questions and to answers. While exploring all of these topics and themes, we will also consider the trope of storytelling itself, which figures prominently in so many works of the genre. What is wrapped up in the gesture of telling a story, and in the ways, contexts, and reasons in and for which these stories get told? Readings (subject to change) include works by Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Edith Wharton, Henry James, Shirley Jackson, Helen Oyeyemi, Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, Oscar Wilde, and others.",Penelope Usher,11:40am,12:55pm,00614,,X1045-20261-001,GHOST STORIES,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1045-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ENGL1045X001,LECTURE

 move from early examples of hybridity to postmodern experimentation to creative examinations
 into such contemporary issues as climate change, A.I., and the structural racism that inspired
 Black Lives Matter. Genres include legal treaties, programming code, comics, cinema, opera,
 jazz, and of course, poetry. Students will be asked to write three short essays, take turns leading

ENGL BC1246,INTIMATE COMPANIONS: READING AND WRITING,"This First-Year course will engage with literary expressions of the universally interesting topic of relationships. Tony Tanner in his 
Adultery in the Novel
 characterizes marriage as “the structure which supports all structure.” Contemporary critics have seen marriage as essential to maintaining the “family values” of the bourgeoisie; feminists and Marxists have challenged the economic assumptions of patriarchally-defined marriage. Folklorists have treated marriage as the endpoint of the search for a safe domestic space. We will touch on this subject, but will also turn to writing about other indispensable relationships that, increasingly, fill our lives. Animals and botanicals—and our relationship with nature—have become so obviously  Important in the past ten years that they deserve to underpin our core values, too.
  
Starting with classic fairy tales and moving on to short fictions, contemporary American poetry, an affectionate study of the psyches of trees, and brief essays on animals we live with, this course will deliver an exportable cluster of ideas that may change our lives.",Margaret R Ellsberg,2:40pm,3:55pm,00904,,X1246-20261-001,INTIMATE COMPANIONS,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1246-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261ENGL1246X001,LECTURE

Increasing numbers of AI experts and researchers emphasize the urgent need for college students to develop AI literacy, preparing them for evolving job markets, fostering ethical awareness, and ensuring equitable participation in an AI-driven society. To help them achieve AI literacy, this introductory-level course teaches students how to ethically and effectively use Generative AI (GAI) by exploring how GAI works, how to use it properly, and how to critically evaluate its output. Students will understand AI model functionality, distinguish GAI from traditional AI, examine issues of originality, authorship, intellectual property, copyright, plagiarism, fair use, accuracy, bias, environmental impacts, and privacy - all while developing meta-awareness about how AI simulates certain aspects of human creativity and cognition The course's placement in Barnard's English Department reflects the recognition that AI's development requires interdisciplinary perspectives beyond STEM, as AI research increasingly intersects with humanities and social sciences to address ethical, social, and cultural implications. Through ethics-focused assignments and writing projects culminating in a final research investigation in students' chosen fields, this course empowers students to resist pure AI reliance and actively control these technologies rather than remaining passive observers of AI's expanding influence in academia and society.",Benjamin M Breyer,8:40am,9:55am,00613,,X1249-20261-001,AI LITERACY IN PRACTICE,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1249-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ENGL1249X001,LECTURE

In this workshop, we will practice taking creative risks, writing fiction and nonfiction. We will examine four key craft areas: voice, characterization, imagery, and arrangement, both in contemporary published writing and in the writing of the people in this class. In small and large group workshops, we will consider each writer’s work with care and attention to the writer’s vision. By discussing each work-in-progress on its own terms, we will help our fellow writers deepen the meaning and impact of their work. Through risk-taking, and building a creative community, we will also grow and deepen our personal relationships to craft.

Section 1, taught by Angel Nafis: Poetry Belongs With Us
 
As legend Lucille Clifton said, “poetry began when somebody walked out of a cave and looked up at the sky with wonder and said, “Ahhh.” That was the first poem.” In this class we will be demystifying the fundamentals of writing poetry by sharpening our most natural sonic and narrative instincts. We will use these instincts to guide our insights as we explore and practice specific craft elements and structural gestures—from the Ode, Elegy, and Sonnet, to Ekphrasis and Erasure. We’ll study the work of contemporary luminaries like Gwendolyn Brooks, Kaveh Akbar, Sharon Olds, Jenny Xie, June Jordan, Ocean Vuong, and more; using their example to inspire us on how best to understand and command the poetic line. Class time will include weekly writing prompts and share-outs. Come prepared to take risks and foster curiosity.

In what ways can poems deepen our understanding of ourselves, each other, and the world we share? How do we, as poets, unlock the full potential of our chosen medium, language? What do we mean by “voice” in a poem, and when and how does “voice” emerge? Required readings are central to our work together, and specified titles and volumes must be acquired by the third week of the semester.

Narrative Strategies: 
This course will explore the different ways that stories can be told. How a story is written is as important as what a story is about. Is there a turn at the end that changes everything you thought you knew? Is the narrator speaking from inside experience, reportage from the front lines of another world? How can the epistolary form be utilized to effect? Students will workshop their own stories, participate in four in-class generative writing sessions, and read weekly short stories demonstrating various strategies for style, voice, setting, dialogue, form, and point of view. Particular focus will be placed on writing from the margins and writing as an act of bearing witness.
  
Section 2 (taught by Gina Apostol in Spring 2026):
 
This course will focus particularly on crafting the literary technique of point of view in fiction. Students will craft work with this question in mind: in what ways are art and ethics combined in the crafting of point of view? Students will practice writing from different narration modes: third person limited and omniscient, free indirect discourse, first person, and so on. They will consider the ethics of point of view by reading short stories, among them stories from Borges’s 
Labyrinths
, John Keene’s 
Counternarratives

What drives the music of a poem? How does one create rhythm and song? In what ways do chunks of language sort and arrange the perception of our readers? The purpose of this advanced poetry workshop is to closely study syntax, or in the words of Ellen Bryant Voigt, “the order of the words in each human utterance.” To further build upon our technical foundation as writers, we will also engage in other elements of craft, such as deep imagery, grammatical moods, tone, and poetic closure. We will be reading a variety of poets, including Etel Adnan, Rita Dove, Brigit Pegeen Kelly, John Murrillo, Choi Seungja, and Yuki Tanaka. Be prepared to generate new material independently for peer workshops where you will gain valuable feedback and constructive criticism. 
  
Apart from challenging your poetics on a technical level, I expect you to come to class with a strong desire to create meaning out of your daily lives, your personal or collective histories, and the futures that you are actively imagining. Your openness and willingness to grow as a human, poet, and critical thinker are fundamental to fostering a kind and supportive community in the classroom.

Spring 2026: Drawing Cartoons and Comics
  
In this class, New Yorker cartoonist and graphic novelist Liana Finck will teach you the basics of making single-panel cartoons, writing and drawing comics, and generally expressing yourself in a mixture of words and pictures. You will learn to diagram your problems, craft jokes, and tell stories visually. You’ll get an overview of useful materials, programs and machines, and how to use all these things with a light enough touch that you can still focus on your art. You will get comfortable with processes for generating ideas and editing your work. We will read some graphic novels, look at lots of cartoons, and dip a toe into the history of colloquial visual storytelling. You will finish the semester with a large body of small-scale work, one serious longer piece, and a better understanding of your voice and what you have to say.

Thomas Browne, a physician as well as writer, tackled the problem of intolerance and religious conflict. Thomas Hobbes thought only a firm (authoritarian?) government could reestablish peace and security, while Gerard Winstanley (a “Leveller”) thought that owning land (and money) was the source of all war and misery. Transgressive women had their own ideas. The Quaker leader Margaret Fell defended women's right to preach.

ENGL BC3215,VICTORIAN SCIENCE&SCIFI,"Although Victorian fiction is best known today for its realist commitment to representing the world “as it really is,” especially in genres such as the courtship novel and the Bildungsroman, Victorian novelists also wrote during an age of enthusiastic scientific inquiry that questioned and revised the very fabric of the reality that realist genres purported to represent. This course will accordingly explore the more adventurous and speculative fiction of the Victorian period that was most closely attuned to these new ways of representing and thinking about reality. How did new scientific developments such as evolutionary theory in biology, and the atomic theory in physics, reshape how writers viewed the relationships between human and animal, self and other, space and time, body and mind? How did departing from traditional realist modes enable Victorian science fiction writers to explore the ethical, social, and political implications of scientific theories in ways that scientific prose may not have envisioned? In this course we will read major works of Victorian fiction, by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others, alongside selections of scientific prose in such fields of Victorian science as biology, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and psychology. Throughout the course, we will understand “science” to include both major developments in the history of science, such as the emergence of evolutionary thought, as well as more eccentric Victorian areas of inquiry, such as phrenology, mesmerism, telepathy, and degeneration. The first three units into which the course is divided each explore a major field of Victorian science alongside a major conceptual category that it challenged and altered: biology and the nature of the human; psychology and the constitution of the self; the physical sciences and the nature of space and time. In each unit, we will investigate how writers’ engagements with these conceptual questions led them to experiment with literary categories such as character, narration, and plot. The course will close with a unit on texts that more broadly address Victorian conceptions of progress, technology, and development. In addition to these specific thematic and formal questions, we will think broadly about how the Victorians understood the value of science and technology in relation to the arts and to literature, and ask what their answers to these questions can offer us as we navigate similar questions today.

In this class we will discuss the narrative of the ""American"" story, and how stories of immigrants and minority identities redefine and complicate it. The goal of the class is to investigate how writers frame a sense of identity in relation to the ""American ideal"".

ENGL BC3321,"Changing Climate, Changing World","An interdisciplinary course focused on environmental humanities and based in the English department, “Changing Climate, Changing World” will examine the representation of nature across time and its implications for global warming and biodiversity from multiple perspectives, emphasizing issues of climate change and environmental justice. The course will provide a conceptual framework for reading and critiquing the representation of nature in the context of historical, economic, social, cultural, scientific and political change.
  
 The course design asks students to address climate change in the context of the industrial revolution before discussing environmental issues in a pre-industrial and finally a post-industrial context. We will begin in media res by addressing issues of industrialization and colonialism in the mid-18th and 19th century before considering indigenous, medieval, and renaissance representations of nature. In the second half of the course, we return to examine contemporary issues from the early 20th century to the present.
  
 The course will meet twice weekly in Spring 2025. One of these meetings will include a lecture with a guest faculty member from Barnard and Columbia, or occasionally with other experts, artists, and activists from New York and beyond, followed by questions from the audience on the lecture. The second meeting will emphasize student discussion of the lecture and associated readings, with the purpose of integrating each lecture into the total course framework. Since all the participating faculty are teaching full time, we will aim to schedule lectures in the late afternoon or evening to minimize conflicts. We would also like to open some of the lectures to the public, either virtually or in person, so that their impact could be felt beyond the class itself.",Linn C Mehta,5:40pm,6:55pm,00619,,X3321-20261-001,Changing Climate and Worl,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3321-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,MW,20261ENGL3321X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3413,SERIAL HORROR,"Cannibals! Orphans! Strikes! Vampires! This course asks how do horror stories
 
employ suspense and disgust to unsettle political, social, and ethical complacency in the hearts and minds of readers and audiences? We will consider the pan-media global adaptations, translations, reiterations, and afterlives of several powerful horror stories—maritime, domestic, industrial, and supernatural-- as they serially repeat across national borders, languages, historical periods, and delivery platforms, from novels, plays, and film to an underwater sculpture, photographs, paintings, advertisements, a graphic novel, and other aesthetic forms. We will read each adaptation in synchronic dialogue with its companions, in diachronic perspective, and through relevant theoretical lenses, comparing the priorities of aesthetic form in the context of the national, cultural, and the historical contingencies of class and race difference. Texts may include the 
Raft of the Medusa, Jane Eyre, Mary Barton, Germinal, Dracula
 and the 
Dybbuk.

ENGL BC3418,DESIRE AND METAMORPHOSIS,"Change is fundamental to our experience as human beings, and the experience of change lies at the heart of most great stories. Sometimes this is a transition that the heroine has desired; other times, alteration and transformation arise from sources mysterious and unknown, or as a result of the journey the story has brought them. This course examines the element of change in a wide range of literature, from Ovid to Maggie Nelson, from Shakespeare to Roxane Gay—but it also provides an opportunity for students to consider the ways in which they, too have been changed—by joy, by trauma, by time. In addition to writing critically about the works we will read together, students will also write a personal essay about their experience of metamorphosis; this essay will be examined in a modified workshop format. At semester’s end, students will re-write and change that same essay, in hopes of seeing how revision on the page might provide a model for understanding the metamorphoses we experience as human beings on this earth. Authors will likely include Ovid, Kafka, Robert Louis Stevenson, Borges, Shaun Tan, Roxane Gay, George Saunders, Arthur C. Clarke, Shakespeare, and Maggie Nelson. There will be a final exam and a critical paper, as well as the personal essay, in two drafts.",Jennifer F Boylan,11:40am,12:55pm,00093,,X3418-20261-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3418-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261ENGL3418X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3456,WHAT WILL SUFFICE: INCURSIONS INTO MODER,"Beginning with the radical breaks of Whitman, Dickinson, and Baudelaire, this course traces how, over the last two centuries, poets across continents have redefined what poetry can be in the face of modernity, exile, revolution, and personal crisis. Our focus will not be on national traditions in isolation but on the resonances and tensions that emerge when poets in different cultures and eras confront similar questions: What forms can poetry take in times of upheaval? How does exile reshape the lyric voice? When does poetry become a vehicle for revolution? And, in Wallace Stevens’s words, what will suffice for poetry when the theatre of the world has changed so profoundly? We will attend closely to the central issue of translation: how meaning and form shift across languages, and how those shifts shape our understanding of what poetry can do.
  
We will focus on selections from a single author in each class. Readings and viewings will range from canonical figures such as Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda, and Anna Akhmatova to experimental voices like Tristan Tzara, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Ntozake Shange, alongside contemporary lyricists like Lana Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar.",Victor Zarour Zarzar,5:40pm,6:55pm,00838,,X3456-20261-001,CONTEMPORARY WORLD POETRY,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3456-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ENGL3456X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3521,GLOBAL LITERATURES IN ENGLISH,"The title of this course suggests that there are literatures across the “globe” written in English, and that we will study them. But this statement rests on a series of assumptions: the 
a priori 
existence of a globe with latitudes, longitudes, and borders; a singular category of “literature” produced in different geographical locations across the globe; and finally, that these literatures are written in English. During the course of the semester, we will investigate and (occasionally overturn) all three of these assumptions. 
  
In order to do so, we will read across different literary genres (short stories and novels, plays, poetry, and essays), while also reading texts that move between these genres or defy them altogether. We will read texts that were originally written in English, as well as texts that have been translated into English, and we will learn and discuss the term “global anglophone” along with the ways in which this term has been challenged. During our collective readings and discussions, we will map the locations that arise in each text 
and
 the locations out of which these texts arise. We will study the relationship between literature, translation, and mapping, and we will learn and discuss the concept of planetary thinking and writing as an alternative to border and global thinking.",Atefeh Akbari Shahmirzadi,2:40pm,3:55pm,00686,,X3521-20261-001,GLOBAL LITERATURES IN ENG,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3521-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ENGL3521X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3609,THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM OF CO,"From Frederick Douglass’s The North Star, which insisted that journalism could be a tool for liberation and collective conscience, to today’s digital-first platforms, American journalism has always been a site of struggle over truth, power, and representation. This course explores the power of journalism to shape public conscience — from the days when print was the Twitter of its time to the rise of radio, television, and digital media. At its core, this seminar centers the voices of journalists of conscience — those who speak truth to power, challenge dominant narratives, and reflect the full spectrum of human experience. We will approach journalism through a lens that foregrounds the perspectives of people of color, recognizing how mainstream media has historically erased, distorted, or marginalized their voices while also highlighting the powerful traditions of resistance and self-representation in journalism.
  
To foster meaningful connection and collaboration, students will be split into groups for the semester. These groups will meet in breakout rooms during each class session to workshop ideas, respond to prompts, and sometimes collaborate on short journalistic pieces. The goal is to make a large seminar feel intimate and to encourage peer-to-peer dialogue throughout the course.
  
 Through weekly readings, in-class discussions, site visits, guest speakers, and multimedia projects, students will examine how journalism has both reflected and resisted dominant narratives across history. Students will also create original work that embodies conscience-based journalism.",Maria D Hinojosa,11:40am,12:55pm,00685,,X3609-20261-001,US JOURNALISM OF CONSCIEN,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3609-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261ENGL3609X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3644,DEPRESSION,"Depression has existed for all time.  But our explanations of it has shifted, from sin, to an imbalance of the humours, and a poetic inspiration; from the eighteenth-century mechanistic understanding of the self, to the Freudian family romance that generates trauma, and to our current neuro-genetic understanding of the mind as a machine that can achieve happiness with pharmaceutical intervention.    We will follow these permutations, even as we read novels, poems, plays, and view film (and art) for their diagnostic awareness of mental suffering.   And we will also ask the question: what if depression comes not from within but without, the intelligent response of aware minds to a world that has become undone.",Daphne Miriam Merkin,4:10pm,6:00pm,00094,,X3644-20261-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3644-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261ENGL3644X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3750,"GENDER, SEXUALITY AND THE AMERICAN STAGE","This seminar investigates how American theatre/performance, as read through the lens of gender and sexuality, operates as a cultural force.  Simply put, the U.S. is obsessed with sex; theatre/performance has proven a fertile medium for America’s expression of this obsession. Exploring texts from the seventeenth through the twenty-first centuries, we will consider how performance intersects with the nation state’s desire to regulate how we “practice” gender both publicly and behind closed doors and how that intersects, overlaps and influences the politics of American Identity. How is performance, which always includes gendered/raced/classed/sexualized bodies, situated in relationship to ideas of a national body politic?  How does the American nation state hinge on how gender and sexuality are performed both on-stage and off?",Pamela Cobrin,11:00am,12:50pm,00684,,X3750-20261-001,PERFORMING THE BODY POLIT,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3750-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261ENGL3750X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3768,LITERATURE ON DRUGS,"Whether as sources of artistic creativity, symbols of moral decay, avenues of escape, or
 foundations for alternative forms of sociality, drugs are an inexhaustible source of inspiration
 for all manner of storytellers. Why is that? This course surveys the narrative history of
 “literature on drugs” from three angles: first, we examine poetry and fiction composed under
 the influence of mind-altering intoxicants; second, we study literature about drug-induced
 experiences and the counter-cultures they have fueled; and we ask why literary criticism is
 essential to articulate the danger and allure of drugs, past, present, and future. We will read
 from literary psychonauts including William Blake, William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, Allen
 Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, Anaïs Nin, and Hunter S. Thompson; historians of the highly weird like
 Michel Foucault and Erik Davis; and an array of primary sources on the legal, therapeutic, and
 psychological complexities of drug use, such as Billy Holiday, Sigmund Freud, William James,
 and Margaret Mead. We also will consider the cinematic history of literature on drugs with
 films like Altered States, Trainspotting, and Apocalypse Now. The course incorporates hands-on
 archival work and includes a visit to Columbia’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library.",Nathan Gorelick,2:40pm,3:55pm,00683,,X3768-20261-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3768-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261ENGL3768X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3865,OUT OF PLACE,"Literature has always attracted the outsider, and literature itself seems to demand from its writers to momentarily step out of the fray in order to hope to observe it. The modern age has offered different examples of this. When Bernard Levin described V.S. Naipaul as an ‘inquiline’ author — meaning, a guest or a lodger, an animal that lives in another's nest — Naipaul responded:
  
‘When I see the sun set here at Stonehenge, there is a way that it is somebody else’s sun, somebody else’s landscape, it has somebody’s else's history connected with it. I can't avoid that: that's the way I think.’
  
When Virginia Woolf received news of the death of Joseph Conrad, she sat down and penned an admiring obituary that opens with what might be read as a presumptuously arrogant statement:
  
‘Suddenly, without giving us time to arrange our thoughts or prepare our phrases, our guest has left us; and his withdrawal without farewell or ceremony is in keeping with his mysterious arrival, long years ago, to take up his lodging in this country.’
  
Despite Woolf’s English snobbishness, her words reveal something true about Conrad’s situation, and about the place of many other writers who were, for one reason or another, obliged to operate in foreign lands, inside other languages or states of being, authors such as V.S. Naipaul, Ovid, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, Jean Rhys, Waguih Ghali and David Malouf.
  
Through the close analysis of a narrow selection of works, this class will chart the ways in which such works reveal the nature and imaginative location of the artist out of place. We will be interested in the question of to what extent is writing a process of mapping an intellectual, aesthetic, psychic or geographical territory. We will be motivated by close reading, interpretation, and the adventure of comparing different portraits of being an outsider-insider.
  
We may refer to fragments by travellers and explorers such as Leo Africanus, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Bartolomé de las Casas, and Ibn Battuta, or look at the work of artists who crossed boundaries, such as the 15th century Venetian painter Gentile Bellini and the impact of his visit to Mehmed II’s court in 1479, or the influence of the Arabesque on the music of Claude Debussy.

ENGL BC3992,SENIOR PROJECT IN CREATIVE WRITING,"Enrollment limited to Barnard senior English majors with a concentration in creative writing.
  
This creative writing workshop represents an opportunity for creative writing concentrators to focus on one large project that will serve as a capstone senior project. As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project—such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement.

While we will read some practical “how to” literature and models, the focus will be on writing, workshopping material, and discussing process (time-management, organization, etc). Both out-of-class assignments and in-class writing exercises should serve to extend your ideas—or shake them loose—and bring you closer to a dissertation that represents your vision, makes others want to read your work, and reminds you why you care. By the end of the year, you will have a polished dissertation prospectus and should have submitted at least one article for publication (or have one close-to-ready for submission).

ENGL GR6918,Queer Theory,"Recent scholarship in queer theory speaks of “bad education” and “ugly feelings,” “beautiful experiments” and “poor queer studies.” In this survey of mostly recent queer theoretical work we will read a range of texts that debate the use, the abuse and the uselessness of queer theory in an era of anti-intellectual policies aimed at both critical race theory and gender and sexuality studies. While Lee Edelman, in 
Bad Education
, insists that queer theory has nothing to teach us, Paul Preciado in 
Dysphoria Mundi
 proposes that the whole world is ailing from a shared dysphoria. Meanwhile, at the intersections of Afro-Pessimism and queer theory, Calvin Warren proposes that to speak of Black trans identities is impossible given the negative ontologies that pertain to Black personhood. Working through oppositions between optimism and pessimism, utopia and dystopia, good and bad feelings, beauty and ugliness, we will ask: What constitutes the ethical in queer theory and how does queer theory approach the good, the bad and the beautiful? At stake here are questions about aesthetic experimentation and politics and unpredictable links between beauty and power, alternative subjects and domination, and bodies and language.",Jack Halberstam,2:10pm,4:00pm,13061,,G6918-20261-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/G6918-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Engineering:Graduate

ENGL GU4729,CANTERBURY TALES,"(Lecture). Beginning with an overview of late medieval literary culture in England, this course will cover the entire Canterbury Tales in the original Middle English. We will explore the narrative and organizational logics that underpin the project overall, while also treating each individual tale as a coherent literary offering, positioned deliberately and recognizably on the map of late medieval cultural convention. We will consider the conditions—both historical and aesthetic—that informed Chaucer’s motley composition, and will compare his work with other large-scale fictive works of the period. Our ultimate project will be the assessment of the Tales at once as a self-consciously “medieval” production, keen to explore and exploit the boundaries of literary convention, and as a ground-breaking literary event, which set the stage for renaissance literature.",Eleanor Johnson,8:40am,9:55am,13044,,W4729-20261-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4729-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

ENGL GU4975,PRISON LITERATURE,"Prison literature—poems, plays, memoirs, novels, and songs written in prison or about prison—constitute a significant part of American literature. Prisons expose many of the systemic inequalities of American life, above all those based on racism and the enduring legacies of slavery. Using the tools of critical race theory, feminism, and class analysis, this course will explore the forms of cultural expression that have emerged in relationship to the American prison experience. Though the course will touch on the rise of convict leasing, chain gangs, and work farms as part of the penal system under Jim Crow, the main focus will be on developments in the U.S. prison system and in prison literature since the 1960s, roughly from the prison writing of George Jackson, Angela Davis, and Malcolm X to the outpouring of contemporary fiction and poetry about prison life by Jesmyn Ward, Colin Whitehead, Rachel Kushner, and Reginald Betts. This is the era of what Michelle Alexander has called “the new Jim Crow,” the rise of mass incarceration, the partial privatization of the penal system, and the growth of supermax facilities.
  
Among the questions we will explore together are these: What tools and techniques do writers use to construct the prison experience? What are the affordances offered by various genres (drama, autobiography, poetry, the novel) for exploring the prison system and the systems of oppression that converge at that site? Does some literature of incarceration perpetuate damaging discourses about “felons,” or does it revise and complicate stereotypes and narratives about incarcerated individuals? How do narratives involving change, conversion, growing up, or being defeated operate in various genres of prison literature? What role do mourning, witnessing, testifying, and resistance play in such writing? What is the imagined audience of various genres of prison writing, that is, for whom is it written? What ethical and political demands does such writing make on us as readers, citizens, activists?",Jean E Howard,10:10am,12:00pm,13050,,W4975-20261-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4975-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ENGL UN2000,Approaches to Literary Study,"Why does literature affect us as it does, why might you want to understand its history, strategies, and meaning, and how exactly do you go about that? This course won’t give you 
the
 answer, because there is no single answer. It will instead point the way toward the multitude of possible answers, giving you a variety of critical tools for exploring these questions, and deepening your powers as a thinker, reader, and writer.
             The course consists of weekly lectures by department faculty members (ENGL 2000) and small weekly seminars with advanced doctoral candidates (ENGL 2001). The lectures will introduce you to texts from across literary history and in various genres (poetry, drama, prose narrative, etc.), giving you an opportunity to learn from and get to know our renowned faculty members. The intimate seminar setting will give you an opportunity to delve further into these texts and techniques, debate their meaning with one another and an expert guide, and engage in exercises that advance your critical writing and interpretive skills, putting into practice what you’ve learned. You will encounter the wide variety of critical approaches taken by our faculty, your seminar leader, and the discipline at large, while learning to expand upon these approaches and make them your own.
             The course is required for English majors and minors (who should take it as early as possible in their Columbia careers), but it is for everyone: advanced students of literature or those new to literary study; committed majors or those still exploring; anyone seeking the excitement and immersion this course offers.

Some of these characters cheat, lie, and murder, while others perfect the guise of seeming compliance; some brazenly flout the structures that aim to contain them, while others are subtler in their subversion. We will use these plays to investigate what is by turns exciting, threatening, and frightening about these unruly women, paying attention to the ways that they are punished and sometimes rewarded. We will also attend to the resources of theatrical form, especially the early modern use of boy actors to play women’s parts, to ask how the conditions of staging uphold or undercut the plays’ ideological messages. Finally, we will supplement our reading of this drama with other historical and cultural texts from this period—pamphlets, advice literature, poems, court cases, and ballads—in order to get a better sense of the plays in relation to early modern gender, sexual, and political norms, many of which were crucially different from our own.",Lauren E Robertson,12:10pm,2:00pm,12901,,W3343-20261-001,Unruly Women in EarlyMod,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3343-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

Our classroom will operate as a laboratory for experimenting with the practices that the research identifies.

ENGL UN3402,Language Rights and Wrongs,"This course examines public battles over language in American and invites you to situate your linguistic history in the larger context of thesebattles. We will ask, Is Northern English more correct than Southern English? Are Black English speakers disadvantaged in the job market? Should English be our national language? What should the language of instruction be in public schools? Do nonbinary students have a right to determine the pronouns their professors use to address them? These language rights battles play out in Congress, the courts, and classrooms. At stake are voting access, employment rights, learning opportunities, and the pathway to American citizenship.
  
The first half of the semester will introduce you to sociolinguists’ understandings of language differences. We will put their research in conversation with the lived experiences of diverse Americans by exploring a number of literacy narratives. And as a class, we will carry out research to study the language attitudes and experiences of members of our own community. The second half of the semester features a series of case studies—legal cases, school board fights, academic battles, legislation—that will lay bare the surprising disagreements between what sociolinguists understand about language and what laypeople passionately believe about it.

The New York Times reported a “rare cancer observed in 41 homosexuals,” a condition that the CDC would name “AIDS” in 1982. HIV/AIDS transformed the shape of queer politics. It encouraged coalitional organizing that necessarily responded to the interlocking nature of race, gender, sexuality, and class. In this course, we will examine literature, film, visual art, performance, theory, and political actions produced during the crisis and in its wake. We will analyze the aesthetic and political strategies artists and activists used to respond to the epidemic. Our texts will be diverse, ranging from diaries and notebooks that chronicle life with AIDS to poems and memoirs that memorialize those who were lost. We will read queer theory and critical essays to enrich our primary readings. Writers and artists under consideration include Gregg Araki, Samuel R. Delany, Tory Dent, Gran Fury, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Essex Hemphill, Gary Indiana, Derek Jarman, Jamaica Kincaid, Larry Kramer, Marlon Riggs, Sarah Schulman, and David Wojnarowicz.

ENGL UN3444,"Race, Religion, and Early Modernity","“Race and religion are conjoined twins. They are both products of modernity.”
—Theodore Vial
  
In this course, we will turn the clock back to 
early
 modernity, exploring the entanglement of concepts of racial and religious difference in the texts and cultural products of early modern England. Beginning in sixteenth century England, we will explore how a distinctive English Protestant identity was fashioned in relation to various religious and racial others, most notably the Jew, the Ottoman “Turk”, and the Black African. We will then turn to the literatures of encounter, exploring how the categories of race and religion were articulated in travel narratives, ethnographic accounts, and political polemic. Finally, we will turn to the writings of Afro-descended and Indigenous Christians, exploring how religious self-fashioning was performed by these racialized subjects.
  
Conversations throughout the semester will be attentive to the specificities of the period, whilst also serving to recontextualise and unsettle contemporary categories of racial and religious difference. Seminar readings will primarily consist of primary sources from the period including poetry, prose and drama from England and, in the latter part of the semester, its colonies. These will be supplemented with a variety of textual and non-textual materials, including works of art, historical documents, period-specific scholarship, and contemporary theory.

DuBois, Samuel Delany, Wangechi Mutu, Janelle Monae, Sun Ra, Saul Williams, and others, this class considers the contexts of possibility for re/imagining Black pasts, presents and futures. Paying particular attention to how Black speculative fiction creates new worlds, social orders, and entanglements, students will develop readings informed by ecocriticism, science and technology studies, feminist, and queer studies. We will consider the multiple meanings and various uses of speculation and worlding as we encounter and interpret forms of utopian, dystopian, and (post)apocalyptic thinking and practice.

ENGL UN3832,"New York Intellectuals: Mary McCarthy, H","The nation’s most distinguished homegrown network of thinkers and writers, the New York intellectuals, clustered in its major decades from the late thirties to the late sixties up and down Manhattan, centered mainly in and around Columbia University and the magazine 
Partisan Review
 on Astor Place.  Although usually regarded as male dominated—Lionel Trilling, Clement Greenberg and Dwight Macdonald were among the leaders—more recently the three key women of the group have emerged as perhaps the boldest modernist thinkers most relevant for our own time.  Arendt is a major political philosopher, McCarthy a distinguished novelist, memoirist, and critic, and Susan Sontag was the most famous public intellectual in the last quarter of the 20th century. This course will explore how this resolutely unsentimental trio—dubbed by one critic as “tough women” who insisted on the priority of reflection over feeling—were unafraid to court controversy and even outrage: Hannah Arendt’s report on what she called the “banality” of Nazi evil in her report on the trial in Israel of Adolph Eichmann in 1963 remains incendiary;  Mary McCarthy’s satirical wit and unprecedented sexual frankness startled readers of her 1942 story collection 
The Company She Keeps
; Susan Sontag’s debut 
Against Interpretation
 (1966) turned against the suffocatingly elitist taste of the New York intellectuals and welcomed what she dubbed the “New Sensibility”—“happenings,” “camp,” experimental film and all manner of avant-garde production. In her later book 
On Photography
 (1977) she critiques the disturbing photography of Diane Arbus, whose images we will examine in tandem with Sontag’s book.",Ross Posnock,4:10pm,6:00pm,13007,,W3832-20261-001,New York Intellectuals,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3832-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

ENGL UN3851,INDIAN WRITING IN ENGLISH,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. (Seminar). As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Mahasweta Devi, Bapsi Sidwa, Rohinton Mistry, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy.

Why did so few of the very Jews to whom Jesus preached accept him as their messiah? Why, as the Church grew in wealth and influence, did Jews continue to live in Christian communities, and what was their proper place in Christian society? In our course, we will read early and medieval Christian narratives about Jews that are, in many ways, an attempt to answer these questions – dark imaginative visions of Jews as child-killers, cannibals, and devil worshippers.

ENTA GR6225,Chorus and Collectivity,"For whom does the dramatic chorus speak? In this graduate seminar, we track the figure of the chorus in drama, theater, and performance from antiquity to modernity, investigating how the chorus represents collectivity and enacts new social forms onstage. The chorus, as we’ll find, can be an instrument of tyranny or of transformation, depending on the members who comprise it – whether they are an assembly of elders (Sophocles’s Antigone), a gathering of survivors (Euripides’s The Trojan Women), a cadre of revolutionaries (Bertolt Brecht’s The Mother), a crowd of athletes 2 (Elfriede Jelinek’s Sports Play), or a digital network of chattering AI machines (Annie Dorsen’s Prometheus Firebringer). Our seminar attends to how the chorus shifts across historical, geographic, and cultural contexts: from ancient Athens to postwar Germany, and from American mass culture to decolonizing movements in the Caribbean, the chorus has proven to be a remarkably flexible and resilient element of live art. The course offers graduate students a broad introduction to canonical works of dramatic literature both ancient and modern, while also featuring lesser-known plays and productions by emerging artists. For the first two-thirds of the term, our sessions will juxtapose a dramatic text with a work of social theory (by thinkers including Nietzsche, Simmel, and Goffman), as well as at least one scholarly essay. Our broader goal in the course is to develop fluency in critical methods at the intersection of drama, philosophy, and social theory. In this course, that is, we approach theater as not only responsive to traditions of social thought, but also generative of new social practices and collective habits of body and mind.

ENTH UN3100,HAMLET,"In this course, we will spend a semester reading, thinking about, seeing, and writing about one play, Shakespeare’s 
Hamlet. 
We will begin by reading 
Hamlet 
slowly, using various critical perspectives to attend to some of the historical and contemporary problematics of the play. In addition to glancing at sources (Saxo Grammaticus’ narrative of Amleth’s revenge in 
Historia Danica
) and contemporaries (Thomas Kyd, 
The Spanish Tragedy
), we’ll consider the relationship between the two media of 
Hamlet
’s production, the book and the stage, taking the opportunity to consider what the three texts of 
Hamlet
s—the 1603 quarto, the 1604 quarto, and the folio version—have to say to us about our preconceptions of theatre and print. Then we will turn to two problems. The first is 
Hamlet 
as a conceptual challenge, focusing on Hamlet in modernism, notably as framed by Mallarmé, Eliot, Freud, and Joyce; as part of this consideration  we’ll take up some modern dramatic encounters with 
Hamlet, 
notably Tom Stoppard’s 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dea 
(1966),
 
Heiner Müller’s 
Hamletmachine 
(1977) and Magda Romanska’s 
Opheliamachine 
(2013)
, 
Samuel Beckett’s 
Endgame 
(1957)
. 
We will conclude the semester by thinking about mediated performance, beginning with Laurence Olivier’s controversial (and award-winning) 1948 film, and tracing through Michael Almereyda’s 2000 media allegory,  concluding with two productions that move 
Hamlet 
into the sphere of digital performance, The Wooster Group

ENVP IA6239,Politics & Policy of Urban Sustainabilit,"This is a course for thoughtful people who wish to influence actual policy outcomes related to sustainability challenges in major cities. Its objective is not to provide a primer on urban sustainability solutions; this is readily available from textbooks and will change by the time you are in a position to act. Rather, the course’s objective is to prepare you for the kind of challenges that will face you as a policy practitioner in the field of urban sustainability. Cities are increasingly recognized as a key level of government for environmental and sustainability policy. As at all levels, politics and policy are intensely intertwined, and perhaps more so at the local level because the decisions involved often affect constituents directly and intimately --in their neighborhoods, in their homes, in their commutes. This reading-heavy colloquium explores the politics and the policy of urban sustainability from the perspective of someone who wishes to effect change. It culminates in a team project in which students act as a sustainability policy team in a mayoral (or equivalent) office in one of the world’s major cities. The course considers key components of the city itself, with the objective of understanding what shapes the city and its impact on the environment. It mainly uses case studies from the twentieth-century United States, paired with international readings to allow a comparison with other experiences. The focus on deep case studies allows the consideration of the situations, constraints, and political dynamics of specific situations. It is intended to provide students with the ability to recognize patterns in urban political and policy dynamics related to sustainability. These are paired with an overview of leading solutions and how the professor believes practitioners should evaluate them for their own cities. The course also prominently features in-class presentations and discussions of the students’ main project: a team-based memo making a specific recommendation to solve a problem in a specific major world city, which is presented twice, once for a diagnosis of the problem in a given city and a second time with a policy recommendation. This project is the major portion of the overall grade for the class, and is used to allow the students to wrestle with the challenge of turning ideas from past and present into successful urban sustainability policies that can get implemented in a political and institutional world. In order to cover issues in depth, this course is not exhaustive;",Rohit T Aggarwala,,,10351,,U6239-20261-001,Politics & Policy-Urban S,MPA-ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE POL,ENVP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENVP/U6239-20261-001/,,In-Person,"Architecture

ENVP IA8216,Microeconomics and Policy Analysis II,"This two-semester course demonstrates that it is both possible and useful to think about public policy rigorously: to examine underlying assumptions; to understand how formal models operate; to question vagueness and clichés; and to make sophisticated ethical arguments. An important goal of the class is to have students work in groups as they apply microeconomic concepts to current public policy issues having to do with urban environmental and earth systems. The course includes problem sets designed to teach core concepts and their application. In the spring semester, the emphasis is on the application of concepts to analyze contemporary policy problems. Some time is also devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn microeconomic concepts, but also how to explain them to decision-makers. Student groups take on specific earth system policy issues, analyze options through the use of microeconomic concepts, and then make oral presentations to the class.",Eren Selcuk,,,10353,,U8216-20261-001,Microecon & Policy Analys,MPA-ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE POL,ENVP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENVP/U8216-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ENVP8216U001,LECTURE

ERMC PS5430,LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT,"Indicators of companies running into hard times typically include revenue volatility, loss of key personnel, reputational damage, and increased litigation. However, company failures are frequently marked by insufficient liquidity, or the lack of cash to meet obligations. Liquidity risk is the unexpected change in a company’s cash resources or demands on such resources that results in the untimely sale of assets, and/or an inability to meet contractual demands and/or default. In extreme cases, the lack of sufficient cash creates severe losses and results in company bankruptcy.
  
An institution’s cash resources and obligations can and must be managed. Indeed, the field of liquidity risk management is an established part of treasury departments at sizable institutions. The regularity of cash flows and the turbulence of business and markets must be assessed and quantified.

FILM AF6965,"Waves on Different Shores: France, Japan","In the early 1960s, a number of new film movements in national cinemas around the world. Inevitably called “new waves” or “new cinemas,” these movements, usually made up of young filmmakers, would challenge both the cinematic industrial structures in each of their respective nations, as well propose often radically different approaches to filmmaking and to cinematic storytelling. This course will explore three important examples of this development—the French New Wave, the Japanese New Wave and the Brazilian Cinema Novo—and detail both the commonalities among these movements (aesthetic, social, political) as well those factors which made each unique. A special concern will be the relationship of the “new waves” to simultaneous radical experiments in visual arts, theater, literature and music. The course will begin with a consideration of Roberto Rossellini’s VOYAGE TO ITALY, a watershed work between Neorealism and subsequent cinematic modernism, and will conclude with Andrei Tarkovsky’s MIRROR, described by Andras Balint Kóvacs as “the last modernist film.”",Richard A Pena,,,11988,,R6965-20261-001,Waves on Different Shores,Film,FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/R6965-20261-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20261FILM6965R001,SEMINAR

Priority is given to Film Studies majors/concentrations in order of class seniority. Corequisites: (Since this is a Film course, it does not count as a writing course for English majors with a Writing Concentration.)
  
This course is ideal for writers of their FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD screenplays. The first several weeks will focus on STORY: What it is, what it isn’t, how to recognize the difference. How to find your own individual stories that nobody else in the universe can tell.
  
From there we will make the transition to the highly individualized techniques, the strengths and limitations, the dynamics of telling a SCREEN STORY; what to leave in, what to leave out. As Michelangelo puts it—starting with a block of marble and chipping away everything that isn’t David.  Through studies of existing screenplays and films in coordination with and hands-on writing exercises which we will share in class, we will develop our skills in all aspects of screenwriting; building fascinating characters, dialogue, story construction (The BIG PICTURE) and scene construction (The Small Picture)

both 
FILM BC3201 (or equivalent) 
and 
FILM BC3200 (or equivalent). Digital Production offers visual storytellers an incredible medium to connect and build an audience.

We will also consider how these queer films are informed by various local, national, cultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers create queer narratives that contest, complicate or reify dominant narratives of gender and sexuality? How do they play around with cinematic and genre conventions?

FILM BC3702,MAJOR WOMEN FILMMAKERS,"Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood’s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as “marginal” or “peripheral” cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet… are these motion pictures really “secondary”? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called “alternative women’s cinema” at the core of film history. Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women’s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agnès Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, Věra Chytilová, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertmüller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler. Among the films screened in the classroom are silent movies –
Suspense
 (Lois Weber, 1913),
 The Seashell and the Clergyman 
(Germaine Dulac, 1928)—, early independent and experimental cinema –
Girls in Uniform

FILM UN2310,THE DOCUMENTARY TRADITION,"This class offers an introduction to the history of documentary cinema and to the theoretical and philosophical questions opened up by the use of moving images to bear witness, persuade, archive the past, or inspire us to change the future. How are documentaries different than fiction films? What is the role of aesthetics in relation to facts and evidence in different documentary traditions? How do documentaries negotiate appeals to emotions with rational argument? From the origins of cinema to our current “post-truth” digital age, we will look at the history of how cinema has attempted to shape our understanding of reality.

FINC B8320,Climate Tech,"Climate Tech refers to a broad range of technologies designed to mitigate the drivers and impacts of climate change. Development and commercialization of these technologies is essential if humanity is to maintain global prosperity while also avoiding catastrophic climate change. This immersion course provides students with the opportunity to work on a real-world technology to address climate change.
 
 Students will be placed in teams of four, composed of two CBS students and two SEAS engineering students. Student teams will be matched with venture capital funds actively financing climate tech that have identified an innovative technology for mitigating or adapting to climate change. Students will meet virtually with their assigned venture fund at the beginning of the course, during a mid-point check-in, and at the end of the course for the final presentation.
 
 Each team will be tasked with assessing their assigned technology on (i) technical viability, (ii) commercial opportunity, and (iii) impact on mitigating or adapting to climate change. The final course deliverables are a presentation to classmates, a presentation to each team’s assigned investment fund, and a written report or presentation deck for the investment fund. Students are also required to complete a reflections assignment at the conclusion of the course. During weeks 4 – 11 students will spend up to nine hours every week doing independent research, collaborating with the fund, and completing assignments.
 
 The purpose of this immersion course is for students to learn to work in teams across different skill sets and disciplines, combining expertise in business and engineering, with the objective of learning how to evaluate technology solutions to climate change. This course is designed to replicate the real-world experience in which collaborative teams use a multi-disciplinary approach to assess the opportunities, challenges, and impacts of new technology solutions to climate change.",,9:00am,12:15pm,14696,,B8320-20261-001,,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8320-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20261FINC8320B001,LECTURE
FINC B8322,Private Equity Field Study,"The “Private Equity Lab” offers a distinctive experiential learning opportunity for students to engage directly with private equity firms on real-world projects. This course is a blend of academic instruction and hands-on experience, tailored for those looking to deepen their understanding of private equity (PE) through practical application. Partnering with PE firms identified through the Columbia Business School's (CBS) alumni network in the New York City area, this program supports students who work on specific research projects integral to the firms' current deals, portfolio management, or investment strategy. These projects are screened to be mission-crucial but not mission-critical for the firms. This ensures students will work on meaningful projects while protecting the partner firm’s performance.  The course thus facilitates a connection between a student and a PE firm with a self-contained research project that could benefit from the student’s skills.  
 The course aims to coordinate a collection of such projects that would otherwise be organized as “Field Study Projects” in independent studies and seeks to overcome the challenge of students sourcing these opportunities and identifying faculty advisors to mentor the project. Importantly, this is not an internship arrangement, and students are not paid (thus, the hours worked are capped at the usual amount of total expected class time).",Michael Ewens,2:20pm,3:30pm,14471,,B8322-20261-001,Private Equity Field Stud,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8322-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,T,20261FINC8322B001,LECTURE

Asset owners may be individuals (e.g. personal wealth), collective owners (e.g. families or pension funds), charitable endowments and foundations (e.g. Columbia University), corporations, and nations (e.g. sovereign wealth funds). We characterize the properties of asset returns and the nature of various investment strategies to assess how asset management can meet the specific investment goals of asset owners. Asset owners usually delegate management of their portfolios to financial intermediaries, which may invest across a broad array of assets or specialize in a certain investment style or asset class. The delegated nature of investments necessitates understanding the principal-agent issues and market frictions associated with each type of asset class.",Geert Bekaert,2:20pm,5:35pm,14452,,B8323-20261-001,,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8323-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

FINC B8368,Security Analysis,"The course’s objective is to present a rational investment philosophy and process for equity security analysis and capital allocation. The course has three sections:
 
 (1) Investment Philosophy and Capital Markets
 
 What is the objective of security analysis and investing?
 Why does a value-based methodology win over time?
 Does Modern Portfolio Theory explain empirical evidence?
 What is more instructive for investment analysis – determining value or expected return?
 What is the difference between “cheap” and “mis-priced”?
 (2) Investment Process – Valuation and Competitive Strategy
 
 What is the difference between a great business, a good business and a bad business?
 How can we evaluate when a business and/or an industry’s mid-long term economics change?
 How can we evaluate company specific structural mis-pricings that exist?
 How can we categorize investment opportunities to improve how we value and define them?
 How can we define a process to source mis-pricings into investment categories?
 What are the commonly used valuation methodologies and which are most instructive for certain situations?
 What is the most effective framework for modeling a business and what are the pitfalls?
 How can we evaluate management’s history of capital allocation? How important is it and how do we factor this into valuation?
 (3) Capital Allocation and Global Macro
 
 What top-down inputs are instructive for a security analyst?
 What lessons have we learned from previous bubbles?
 Can computing and evaluating asset class expected returns help source where a security analyst might find mis-pricings and compounding opportunities?
 How do we evaluate secular headwinds or tailwinds for industries and businesses?
 What are the pitfalls of consensus thinking and is there a benefit to seeking the edge of the crowd?
 What are the key economic data points that truly inform the analyst where we are in certain cycles?
 The curriculum will seek to answer these questions by first reviewing investing principals and concepts. Thereafter we will bring in company executives and investment practitioners to provide real world evidence of these principles in action and allow for students to participate in a

The purpose of this class is to answer these questions and equip students to profitably employ short-selling investment strategies. We will introduce students to all aspects of short-selling. However, we will assume that students have prior knowledge of the basics mechanics of shorting a stock, as well as various accounting tricks and “shenanigans” that companies employ to mask weaknesses in their business. To that end, we will provide some materials that should be reviewed before the start of class to review these concepts.
 
 In class, we will first dig into the academic literature behind short selling. We will discuss what has worked historically, and whether or not it has been successful as of late. We will then read and discuss case studies on “famous” shorts and frauds. We will, with the benefit of hindsight, try to identify inflection points in the arc of each company. The students will also become familiar with the risks of shorting frauds too early. We will examine various short selling strategies, including “activist shorting”, that are currently being employed in the markets. We will evaluate what elements make for a compelling short “pitch.” Additionally, students will learn about idea sourcing, portfolio management, risk management, and compliance.
 
 While the title and focus of the class is “Short Selling,” it is important to note that the techniques and investment approaches we will discuss are highly applicable to long-focused investing as well. Deciding not to own a security that is included in a tracking index is functionally the same as shorting the security, and understanding a company’s true profitability (and not the version that it promotes through its accounting decisions) is highly important for valuation efforts. A deep and skeptical research approach should assist fundamental analysts in all fields. We will approach this topic from both theoretical and practical perspectives, drawing heavily on the academic literature around short selling as well as highly-experienced practitioners. We will examine what makes a profitable short, and pay particular attention to unsuccessful shorts and
 how to avoid them.

 The key to equity wealth creation is hiding in plain sight. Since 1926, a mere four percent of stocks have
 generated all the wealth in the US stock market1. We call these unique companies “compounders.”2
 With the exception of a few magic market companies (Facebook, Google), the vast majority of
 compounders achieve this distinction in two acts. One product in one market, in most cases, is simply not
 enough to become a durable and sustainable large-cap company. A second act is usually an adjacent
 product or market. Think of Netflix transitioning from in-home DVD rental to streaming, or Grubhub
 moving from marketplace to first party delivery, or Vail Mountain Resorts translating its subscription
 season pass into an acquisition platform.
 Compounders is a class dedicated entirely to the exploration of these companies. We will start off with an
 examination of their core characteristics and life-cycle. We will then delve more deeply into four
 compounder patterns, illustrated with case studies and brought to life by the executives who led these
 companies to this rare distinction.
 Students will be paired with experienced investors and, over the course of the class, will study six recent
 compounders with the goal of extracting contemporary patterns that may help us to identify the future
 drivers of equity wealth creation. The goal of the class is to understand compounder patterns: what are
 the people, processes and systems that allow small companies to become durable and sustainable large
 companies over time?",,2:20pm,5:35pm,14640,,B8433-20261-001,,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8433-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1.5,,W,20261FINC8433B001,LECTURE

This course will enable students to develop an understanding of the corporate credit markets and build a practical skill set to evaluate and invest in individual credits using a classic Value Investing methodology.
 The approach will be a pragmatic one. Throughout the course, we will focus both on learning how to interpret the market as well as on 4 to 5 different companies - all debt issuers of different credit risk profiles - and will utilize class lectures to discuss the factors that shape capital structure and pricing of various securities (debt or equity) issued by these companies. As part of the final project, students are expected to work in teams and analyze and generate a buy or sell recommendation on the securities issued by a U.S.-based corporate issuer. This assignment will provide students with an opportunity to solidify the learnings in a hands-on, experiential manner.
 In addition to lectures and student presentations, students will also hear from representatives of private equity, credit and distressed investment management, and investment banking firms. These speaker sessions will enable students to gain access to multiple viewpoints to credit markets and various investing techniques and styles.
 Given the importance of credit to companies, we believe that the skill set and knowledge obtained from this class will be valuable whether one becomes an equity (public or private) investor, a credit investor, or an investment banker.

FINC B8442,Shareholder Activism,"Value investing is a challenging but simple endeavor based on two key principles: 1) We view
 shares in a public company as fractional ownership of the business, and 2) we focus on the
 business’ long-term prospects, and try to buy shares at a discount to fair value, with a margin of
 safety against risks inherent in any enterprise. When you execute this strategy well, you will
 find that the biggest risk to your investment does not derive from a weakness in your business
 analysis, or a deficiency in your ability to predict future cash flows. The biggest risk does not
 come from macroeconomic conditions or the seductive cries and cheers of a volatile Mr.
 Market. No -- when a good investment process yields a lousy outcome, the culprit is often bad
 corporate oversight. The inverse of this equation is equally important. The best investments,
 the ones that compound value over many years, don’t arise simply from buying at a bargain
 price. They benefit from a board and management team that know how to drive shareholder
 value.
 This course is about shareholder activism and corporate governance, taught from the
 perspective of value investors, but filled with lessons for anyone who wants to learn how public
 companies work. We believe that most young investment analysts do not have a deep enough
 understanding of the complicated interactions between public company CEOs, boards of
 directors, and shareholders. The best way to learn about corporate oversight is to study the
 fault line where these three constituencies meet. Without this knowledge, it is difficult to
 evaluate the prospects of a poorly-governed company that must change course to create value.
 It is even harder to use your position as a shareholder to be an agent for positive change.
 Shareholder activism can be put to good use and bad. It challenges corporations to utilize their
 assets efficiently, but can also foster destructive and destabilizing short-term strategic
 decisions. It is our goal to teach you to differentiate between good and bad interventions, and
 to give you the tools to lead activist campaigns of your own.
 This will be a fast-paced course with a significant workload, as we examine historical and
 current activist situations. At the end of this course, the students will pitch their own activist
 engagement – a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience crafting a real campaign.
 The winning team will have their work presented",,2:20pm,5:35pm,14638,,B8442-20261-001,,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8442-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

Through a combination of lectures, case discussions, real life examples and a Private Equity Game Simulation this course focuses primarily on the two key components of a successful private equity business: 
Analyzing & Selecting Investment Opportunities
 and 
Managing Portfolio Companies, with a special focus on crafting winning marketing strategies
.
  
 
  
The skills & toolkit you’ll learn in this course, go beyond Private Equity. Analyzing & valuating businesses, implementing operational improvements and realizing value for shareholders are key activities for any organization, especially those operating in Emerging Markets.

focuses on three main issues: 1) Value creation through strategic marketing analysis of opportunities, 2) Management of portfolio companies
 
and 3) How these concepts apply in Emerging Markets
  
 
  
Specifically, we will review key models and frameworks used by top world-class PE practitioners and management consultants to evaluate deals, to better understand industries, drivers of value, players and the likelihood of success of different business models.
  
 
  
Additionally, we will focus on how to manage portfolio companies to achieve superior returns and how to diagnose, solve, recommend and implement top strategic corporate decisions.
  
 
  
All of these skills will be developed and discussed through the lens of Emerging Markets, paying particular attention to the added complexity that these markets bring to PE investment, mainly regarding macro risks, information asymmetry, governance and other issues.

FINC B8469,Distressed Real Estate Investing,"B8332 Real Estate Transactions is recommended. The goal of this course is to make you knowledgeable and conversant about the principles of real estate investing as applied to purchasing distressed assets. The Covid crisis is only the most recent example of how changes in the economy or capital markets can have a profound impact on real estate investors. During the Great Recession and the US Savings and Loan crisis before that, real estate assets suffered appreciable losses, and thus also provided an opportunity for investors to find new opportunities to recapitalize and reposition troubled properties and companies. As both a physical asset and an investment asset with a defined location in space, real estate is strikingly different from other asset classes. It is a long-lived asset that depends on attractive financing, rental increases, and long-term appreciation to maintain its value. Real estate forms part of the alternative investment asset class and institutional investors target a substantial part of their alternatives portfolio in real estate. The class will cover both US and international distressed investments and across traditional and niche sectors. The goal is to provide students with the tools to identify and purchase distressed real estate assets globally and to target superior risk-adjusted rates of return.",,6:00pm,9:15pm,14432,,B8469-20261-001,Distressed RE Investing,Finance,FINC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FINC/B8469-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Business

FINC B8528,Family Enterprise and Wealth,"This course introduces students to the complex topics of family enterprise and family wealth.  Wealth in the United States and globally has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of families, which is having a major impact on business, financial, and philanthropic sectors. These families often start with an entrepreneur who creates an operating business, that later evolves into trusts, holding companies, investment vehicles, a family office, and charitable foundations.   This conglomeration of holdings is referred to as a complex ""family enterprise"" and all the assets of the family comprise its ""wealth."" Given the magnitude of this trend, it is almost inevitable that each MBA student will own, work for, invest in, or otherwise interact with family enterprises after graduation.  
Students will be exposed to a variety of perspectives, including in-depth research, analysis, and insider's views on family dynamics, governance, business, investments, and philanthropy.  The course will proceed from the perspective of family first and particular emphasis will be given the fact that the family’s “human capital” is its most important resource to foster a successful family enterprise and optimize its important role in society.  Technical issues, including legal concepts and structures applicable to family enterprises, will also be examined.  Guest lecturers from industry and family enterprises will provide real-life context to class discussions.  
Students will leave the course prepared to more effectively own, manage, and work with family enterprises, and with a more nuanced understanding of family wealth as it is now understood by leading global families. This will have a direct impact on future success, both personally and professionally.   While the course will be especially relevant for students who come from family enterprises, it will also provide insights and tools for students who intend to work in private wealth management, privately held companies, management consulting, private equity/ venture capital, and social enterprises.  This is not just an investment, finance, or family business management course, as those subjects are covered in more detail elsewhere in the curriculum but is a multi-disciplinary approach to this complex set of issues. 
The course has the following objectives:
- Increase awareness of the role and importance of family enterprises globally.

 enterprises.
 
 Students are placed in teams to evaluate social entrepreneurs from the Columbia University community who have applied
 for funding from the Tamer Fund for Social Ventures. The course is a combination of in-class lectures and discussion, and
 practical application of class lessons outside of the classroom. Major topics covered include: the due diligence process,
 assessing venture pitches and teams, due diligence in emerging markets, due diligence of non-profits, impact
 measurement and management, and valuations and deal structure.
 
 During the course, each student team completes detailed due diligence on their assigned social venture, including
 diligence on applicants, the social venture and the sector. The course concludes with student teams submitting a written

FREN BC3079,HISTORY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE,"This seminar examines the history of the French language, both in France and in the many areas of the world in which French is a primary language. In the first part of the semester we engage in a chronological study of how the language emerged from a fusion of late medieval Latin with Germanic dialects to become a strong national institution. The development of the language is contextualized by consideration of the social and political history of France. We also devote two weeks of discussion to the situation of the French language today, with topics such as linguistic legislation, regional languages and dialects today, and gender inclusivity. This diachronic approach is carried over into the second part of the semester in which we concentrate on French in several regions outside of France including the Caribbean, North Africa, Central Africa, and North America.  Here we examine how the language was first introduced, what it represented at different moments in history, the relation of French to other languages, and the situation of French in the region today. Work for the course includes a digital project (digital timeline and map, and website) to document visually the presence of French in the world, across history and in the 21st century.",Laurie Postlewate,4:10pm,6:00pm,00687,,X3079-20261-001,HISTORY OF THE FRENCH LAN,French @Barnard,FREN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FREN/X3079-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261FREN3079X001,SEMINAR

FREN GU4028,French Film Aesthetics,"The seminar prioritizes a particular branch of French-language film theory and criticism that broadly deals with aesthetics, at the expense of reception and apparatus theories. We follow its history from the silent film-era writings of Germaine Dulac and Jean Epstein to the intersection of film aesthetics and French theory in the work of Barthes, Deleuze, Lyotard, and Rancière, to the most recent inquiries into such notions as montage, découpage, and mise en scène (Aumont, Barnard, Kessler). Weekly films will accompany the readings in order to put pressure on theory, but also to help dissipate its excessive maleness. Because French film aesthetics has been influential around the world and—vice versa—because world cinema has been crucial for the development of French film aesthetics, we will also see American, Italian, Soviet, Japanese, Iranian, Malian, and Taiwanese films, in addition to French films.
  
All films will be presented with English subtitles.

GERM BC3082,"Tempo - Bodies in Motion: Leisure, exerc","This course introduces students of German on the advanced level of language acquisition to depictions of wayfarers in Romantic and modern literature. It includes more recent, 21st-century developments such as literary representations of extreme or physically challenging adventure sports. The selection of texts is geared toward exploring the human experience of leisurely or athletic experiences in urban or natural surroundings. The literary sources make us aware of how the experience of hiking, walking, swimming or climbing is inextricably tied to an understanding of the value of outdoor activities while acknowledging the strong impact of modern technology (maps, GPS, special gear or means of transportation) and recognizing changing attitudes toward strenuous or even risky movements in mountains, rivers, seas or deserts. First, a number of memorable Romantic songs and short poems will give us the opportunity to quickly identify central themes; as we move from poetry to prose, we will continuously adhere to the principle of simplicity and conciseness; this is why we will limit the scope of analysis by using excerpts from novels or longer stories. This way we can spend time on expanding your vocabulary; other features—such as grammar, central motifs, and stylistic features will be of equal importance. Our aim is to reduce the complexity of a text written in German to manageable level and develop our own lexicon for discussing the main topic of “bodies in motion.”",Erk Grimm,4:10pm,5:25pm,00887,,X3082-20261-001,MOVING BODIES IN GERMAN L,German @Barnard,GERM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/GERM/X3082-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261GERM3082X001,LECTURE

HCM_ PS5230,CHANGE MANAGEMENT,"Change is a necessary and constant part of any organization. The change may be expected, or it may be in reaction to unanticipated external and/or internal factors. In fact, organizations that do not change do not last.
  
Change initiatives can be exceedingly complex and disorienting, however. The success of a given changeinitiative often rests on the clarity of vision of an organization’s leaders; an accurate and sensitiveunderstanding of the organization’s culture; the involvement, input and buy-in of multiple internal andexternal stakeholders to the change objectives and process; leaders’ ability to leverage technology tocommunicate and drive change; and an organization’s analytical capabilities to document and measureprogress, and continue to iterate and improve.
  
In light of these requirements, this course seeks to ask: What is the role of the HCM leader in facilitatingchange within an organization? The aims of this course are not abstract. This course will help studentsdevelop skills to support actual organizations (their own and/or others) through change. Lectures, readings,videos, in-class and asynchronous discussions, and assignments will all focus on the practical application ofchange theory and empirical research to real-world organizational contexts.

HIST BC2099,Making the Viking World,"Between the 700s and 1000s, pirates known as Vikings raided much of Europe. Some were linked to merchant groups reaching into Central Asia, while others joined diaspora communities that sailed across the Atlantic. They made their worlds in many ways—through texts, images, artifacts, and behaviors. In this class, students will accomplish the same, guided by the principle that making is best studied by doing. This will be accomplished through a series of creative assignments accompanied by written discussions drawing on scholarship and historical materials. The course will culminate in a written proposal for a museum exhibit allowing students to explore chosen narratives or thematic interests. Through this work, students will learn how Viking-Age peoples made their world and consider how we recreate and represent that world today",Matthew Delvaux,11:40am,12:55pm,00896,,X2099-20261-001,,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2099-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261HIST2099X001,LECTURE
HIST BC2195,Gender and Sexuality in European History,"This course examines the history of gender and sexuality in Europe, from the Renaissance to the present day. We will take a thematic approach, tracing the shifting operations, definitions, and understandings of both gender and sexuality within European culture and society. Topics include: Renaissance visual culture, the witchcraft trials, Enlightenment philosophy, European imperialism and colonialism, revolutions (both political and sexual), moral reform campaigns, the birth of sexology, queer and trans histories, sex work, and the politics of control. Central to this course is an examination of the ways gender and sexuality function at the intersections of class, race, nation, ethnicity, and religion, and how these intersections speak to dynamics of social, cultural, and political power. In our work throughout the semester, we will draw from a range of sources, including film, painting, photography, literature, and music. We will regularly engage with primary sources, which will allow students to learn the skills and techniques necessary for the work of historians. Throughout the course, students will examine how historians write, interpret, and construct histories of gender and sexuality, and question what place these histories have in our contemporary world.",Dale Booth,10:10am,11:25am,00897,,X2195-20261-001,Gender &Sexuality in Euro,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2195-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261HIST2195X001,LECTURE

How did the Fascist “New Order” challenge liberal democracies and why did it fail in World War II? What was the common denominator of Fascist movements across Europe, and in particular in Mussolini’s Italy, Salazar’s Portugal, Franco’s Spain, culminating in Nazi Germany?
  
This class examines the history of Fascism as an ideology, constellation of political movements, and authoritarian regimes that aimed at controlling the modernization of European societies in the interwar period. Thus, the course focuses in particular on the relationship between politics, science and society to investigate how Fascism envisioned the modernity of new technologies, new social norms, and new political norms. The class will also explore Fascism’s imperialist goals, such as the calls for national renewal, the engineering of a new race, and the creation of a new world order.",Angelo Caglioti,4:10pm,5:25pm,00717,,X2375-20261-001,FASCISM IN EURO HISTORY,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2375-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261HIST2375X001,LECTURE

In order to balance the specificity of particular histories and larger processes common to Latin America, units will often start with a general presentation of the main questions and will be followed by lectures devoted to specific countries, regions, or themes. We will look closely at the formation of class and ethnic identities, the struggle around state formation, and the links between Latin America and other regions of the world. We will stress the local dimension of these processes: the specific actors, institutions and experiences that shaped the diversity and commonalities of Latin American societies. The assignments, discussion sections, and lectures are intended to introduce students to the key conceptual problems and the most innovative historical research on the region and to encourage their own critical reading of Latin American history.",Alfonso Salgado,2:40pm,3:55pm,00322,,X2699-20261-001,Latin American Civilizati,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2699-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,MW,20261HIST2699X001,LECTURE

HIST BC2985,History of Global Economic Inequality,"Economic inequality characterizes virtually every human society, informing deep social dynamics. And yet scholars and lay people alike hold vastly differing opinions about the effects that inequality has on the social fabric, and the need to combat it. The question of how wealth and income are distributed among the members of a national community as well as among nations has acquired center stage in analyses about fundamental issues such as the causes of the progress and decline of societies and the dynamics of globalization. Inequality issues are at the heart of discussions about international economic relations, transnational phenomena such as migrations and the domestic economic platforms of political parties.
  
This course will provide students with the critical instruments with which to analyze the main interpretations of economic inequality from the eighteenth century to the present. We will read and discuss authors who have addressed the question of inequality and distribution: how did they frame the issue? What visions of society emerged from their analyses? We will see how the concept of inequality has changed historically, how different dimensions (e.g., national and international) have appeared and disappeared, and how visions of national, international and global inequality inform debates about the foundational elements of the social compact.",Michele Alacevich,8:40am,9:55am,00323,,X2985-20261-001,Hist of Global Econ Inequ,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2985-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261HIST2985X001,LECTURE

Students will examine how ice cores, tree rings, isotopes, bone morphology, genetic materials, and chemical compositions have all been used as keys into the human past, appraising successes and failures. Assignments will offer temporal depth and geographic breadth, ranging from the micro to the global. This course contributes to curricula for the Columbia Center for Science and Society, emphasizing connectivity, migration, and the environment to support the Climate Humanities minor while examining to how material studies are used in broader support of the Science and Society minor. Students from the sciences will meanwhile have an opportunity to develop skills in navigating and communicating within humanistic understandings of rigor. This course will culminate in students selecting a site, collection, or method to evaluate how studies have measured against apparent possibilities for scientific research and historical interpretation in that field.",Matthew Delvaux,2:10pm,4:00pm,00898,,X3076-20261-001,The Science of World Hist,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3076-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261HIST3076X001,SEMINAR
HIST BC3301,Science and Fascism,"In 1942, the American sociologist Robert Merton described modern science as an intellectual enterprise that can produce truthful and factual knowledge only if inspired by democratic values. Yet such concept contrasted starkly with the reality of science in the interwar period and World War II, at the peak of the clash between liberal democracies and fascist dictatorships. What was the role of science in the global conflict between liberalism and the fascist ‘New Order’? What did science and technology look like under fascism?
  
This class examines the relationship between science and fascism in Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Franco’s Spain, and Salazar’s Portugal. During the Great War (1914-1918), science and technology were enlisted as critical assets for the war effort and the international scientific community was shattered across national lines. The Great War proved the importance of the scientific organization of society and state-controlled scientific advancement. Fascism developed this lesson in the interwar period to pursue its nationalist and imperialist goal: the creation of a new world order.
  
Thus, the seminar explores the entanglement between science, technology and fascism by examining a wide range of disciplines, such as physics, medicine, eugenics, statistics, demography, agronomy, and engineering. Focusing in particular on fascism’s central themes of race and empire, the course examines the relationship between state power and scientific expertise, the persecution of Jewish scientists in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and scientists’ critical competition in World War II ahead of the creation of the atomic bomb, which ushered in the new era of the Cold War.",Angelo Caglioti,10:10am,12:00pm,00725,,X3301-20261-001,SCIENCE AND FASCISM,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3301-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261HIST3301X001,SEMINAR

We will also develop a general understanding of the different epochs of economic thinking about the evolving capitalist system. We will analyze classics such as Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, Karl Marx’s Capital, and John M. Keynes’ General Theory, as well as more recent classics that have deeply influenced social science thinking in the second half of the XX century.

At last count, over 15 million people to be (in)exact which makes Lagos the second most densely populated city in Africa. How does a city like Lagos come into being? What are its origins?  What is its history in regional, continental, and global context?  How does it ‘work’ and what work does it do for our understandings of cities, urbanization, urbanism, colonialism, globalization, trans-nationalism, and the spatial factor in Africanist historical analyses?  This course examines the many Lagoses that have existed over time, in space, and in the imagination from the city’s origins to the 21st century.  This is a reading, writing, viewing, and listening intensive course.  We will be reading scholarly, policy-oriented, and popular sources on Lagos as well as screening films and audio recordings that feature Lagos in order to learn about the social, cultural, and intellectual history of this West African mega-city.",Abosede A George,2:10pm,4:00pm,00726,,X3791-20261-001,Lagos: Pepperfarm to Mega,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3791-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261HIST3791X001,SEMINAR
HIST BC3825,"RACE, CASTE, AND THE UNIVERSITY: B. R. A","B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.
  
 
  
This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, Rare Books and Manuscript Library Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.
  
This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and stuents will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research.  This seminar inaugurates an on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with globalizing the reach and relevance of B. R. Ambedkar and to share our findings with the Columbia community and beyond.  Working independently, students will define and pursue individual research projects.  Working together, the class will create digital visualizations of these projects.",Anupama Rao,4:10pm,6:00pm,00727,,X3825-20261-001,"RACE, CASTE, AND UNIVERSI",History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3825-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261HIST3825X001,SEMINAR

The seminar explores the “Other Europe” as a constellation of specific regions as much as key localities from which to view the world. The course is based on the premise that global history should be narrated beyond center-periphery frameworks, and from any place where people have reimagined their relationship to a shared global modernity. We will investigate topics ranging from multi-confessional and multi-ethnic land empires (German, Russian, Habsburg, Ottoman, Soviet) and their post-imperial forms; globalization and isolation; nationalisms and internationalisms; modernization; communisms; borderlands; dictatorships; Orientalism outside of Western Europe; migration and expulsion across borders and the rise of so-called closed societies; interethnic and communal violence, genocide, and mass killing. Through the lens of cultural, intellectual, social, international, transnational, environmental, regional, urban, legal and gender history, and the history of science and technology, we will explore the region’s historic liminality (as a bridge between “East” and “West’) and its historic ties with Western Europe, the Ottoman Empire, the United States, and Southeast Asia.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,12413,,G8397-20261-001,E.

HIST GR8989,Capitalism and Democracy,"It is a common-place that the twentieth century ended with the establishment of capitalism and democracy as the “one best way”. In triumphalist accounts of the end of the Cold War the two are commonly presented as sharing a natural affinity. As never before the democratic formula was recommended for truly global application. To suggest the possibility of a contradiction between capitalism and democracy has come to seem like a gesture of outrageous conservative cynicism, or leftist subversion. And yet the convergence of capitalism and democracy is both recent and anything other than self-evident. It has been placed in question once again since 2008 in the epic crisis of Atlantic financial capitalism.

HIST GU4811,Encounters with Nature: The History and,"This course offers an understanding of the interdisciplinary field of environmental, health and population history and will discuss historical and policy debates with a cross cutting, comparative relevance: such as the making and subjugation of colonized peoples and natural and disease landscapes under British colonial rule; modernizing states and their interest in development and knowledge and technology building, the movement and migration of populations, and changing place of public health and healing in south Asia. The key aim of the course will be to introduce students to reading and analyzing a range of historical scholarship, and interdisciplinary research on environment, health, medicine and populations in South Asia and to introduce them to an exploration of primary sources for research; and also to probe the challenges posed by archives and sources in these fields. Some of the overarching questions that shape this course are as follows: How have environmental pasts and medical histories been interpreted, debated and what is their contemporary resonance? What have been the encounters (political, intellectual, legal, social and cultural) between the environment, its changing landscapes and state? How have citizens, indigenous communities, and vernacular healers mediated and shaped these encounters and inserted their claims for sustainability, subsistence or survival? How have these changing landscapes shaped norms about bodies, care and beliefs? The course focuses on South Asia but also urges students to think and make linkages beyond regional geographies in examining interconnected ideas and practices in histories of the environment, medicine and health. Topics will therefore include (and students are invited to add to these perspectives and suggest additional discussion themes): colonial and globalized circuits of medical knowledge, with comparative case studies from Africa and East Asia; and the travel and translation of environmental ideas and of medical practices through growing global networks.",Kavita Sivaramakrishnan,2:10pm,4:00pm,12185,,W4811-20261-001,Encounters with Nature,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W4811-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20261HIST4811W001,SEMINAR

HIST GU4872,"North Korean History, Culture and Politi","North Korea is widely regarded as a country without a history; as enigmatic as it is isolated. Dispensing with this cliché, this course invites students to engage with North Korean history using a variety of primary and secondary sources. We begin in the medieval period to trace the distinct features of the northern region that made it uniquely receptive to outside ideas. Understanding the north as a frontier zone of experimentation and adaption allows us to examine the attractive power of modernity in the north during the early twentieth century via the influence of Christianity, capitalism and communism. Utilizing texts and materials made in North Korea and internationally, including feature and documentary films, women’s magazines, graphic novels, literary fiction and testimony, the course investigates the conditions within which knowledge about North Korea has been produced, circulated and repressed. Key topics to be explored include the history of Christianity and capitalism in Pyongyang and the northern provinces, communist cadres in the 1930s, the allure of the North in the 1940s, the Korean War and the purges that followed, North Korea’s relations with neighbors and the world, and the high cost its citizens pay for the country’s brutal sanction economy.",Ruth Barraclough,4:10pm,6:00pm,12196,,W4872-20261-001,North Korean History,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W4872-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20261HIST4872W001,SEMINAR

HIST UN1512,The Battle for North America: An Indigen,"This course will explore the struggle to control the continent of North America from an Indigenous perspective. After a century of European colonization Native peoples east of the Mississippi River Valley formed a political confederation aimed at preserving Native sovereignty. This Native confederacy emerged as a dominant force during the Seven Years War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812. At times Native political interests aligned with the French and British Empires, but remained in opposition to the expansion of Anglo-American colonial settlements into Indian country. This course is designed to engage literature and epistemology surrounding these New World conflicts as a means of the colonial and post-colonial past in North America.  We will explore the emergence of intersecting indigenous and European national identities tied to the social construction of space and race. In this course I will ask you to re-think American history by situating North America as a Native space, a place that was occupied and controlled by indigenous peoples.  You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, and not necessarily destined to be absorbed by European settler colonies.  Accordingly, this course we will explore the intersections of European colonial settlement and Euro-American national expansion, alongside of the emergence of indigenous social formations that dominated the western interior until the middle of the 19th century.  This course is intended to be a broad history of Indigenous North America during a tumultuous period, but close attention will be given to use and analysis of primary source evidence.  Similarly, we will explore the necessity of using multiple genres of textual evidence – archival documents, oral history, material artifacts, etc., -- when studying indigenous history.",Michael Witgen,11:40am,12:55pm,11651,,W1512-20261-001,Battle for N.

HIST UN1942,The Year 1000: A World History,"This course is designed to introduce students to the study of premodern history, with a substantive focus on the variety of cultures flourishing across the globe 1000 years ago.  Methodologically, the course will emphasize the variety of primary sources historians use to reconstruct those cultures, the various approaches taken by the discipline of history (and neighboring disciplines) in analyzing those sources, and the particular challenges and pleasures of studying a generally “source poor” period. The course queries the concepts of “global history” and “world history” as applied to the “middle millennium” (corresponding to Europe’s “medieval history”), by exploring approaches that privilege connection, comparison, combination, correlation, or coverage.",Adam Kosto,8:40am,9:55am,11654,,W1942-20261-001,The Year 1000: A World Hi,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W1942-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261HIST1942W001,LECTURE

Russia’s role on the European continent, intellectual movements, unfree labor and emancipation, economic growth and social change, and finally the great revolutions of 1905 and 1917 define the “long nineteenth century.” The second half of the course turns to the tumultuous twentieth century: cultural experiments of the 1920s, Stalinism, World War II, and the new society of the Khrushchev and Brezhnev years. Finally, a look at very recent history since the East European revolutions of 1989-91.

HIST UN2222,NATURE & POWER: ENV HIST NORTH AMERICA,"Environmental history seeks to expand the customary framework of historical inquiry, challenging students to construct narratives of the past that incorporate not only human beings but also the natural world with which human life is intimately intertwined. As a result, environmental history places at center stage a wide range of previously overlooked historical actors such as plants, animals, and diseases. Moreover, by locating nature within human history, environmental history encourages its practitioners to rethink some of the fundamental categories through which our understanding of the natural world is expressed: wilderness and civilization, wild and tame, natural and artificial. For those interested in the study of ethnicity, environmental history casts into particularly sharp relief the ways in which the natural world can serve both to undermine and to reinforce the divisions within human societies. Although all human beings share profound biological similarities, they have nonetheless enjoyed unequal access to natural resources and to healthy environments—differences that have all-too-frequently been justified by depicting such conditions as “natural.”",Karl Jacoby,1:10pm,2:25pm,11656,,W2222-20261-001,NATURE & POWER: ENV HIST,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2222-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261HIST2222W001,LECTURE

HIST UN2336,EVERYDAY COMMUNISM,"This lecture course comparatively and transnationally investigates the twentieth-century communism as a modern civilization with global outreach. It looks at the world spread of communism as an ideology, everyday experience, and form of statehood in the Soviet Union, Europe, Asia (Mao’s China), and post-colonial Africa. With the exception of North America and Australia, communist regimes were established on all continents of the world. The course will study this historical process from the October Revolution (1917) to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster (1986), which marked the demise of communist state. The stress is not just on state-building processes or Cold War politics, but primarily on social, gender, cultural and economic policies that shaped lived experiences of communism. We will closely investigate what was particular about communism as civilization: sexuality, materiality, faith, selfhood, cultural identity, collective, or class and property politics. We will explore the ways in which “ordinary people” experienced communism through violence (anti-imperial and anti-fascist warfare; forced industrialization) and as subjects of social policies (gender equality, family programs, employment, urban planning). By close investigation of visual, material and political representations of life under communism, the course demonstrates the variety of human experience outside the “West” and capitalist modernity in an era of  anti-imperial politics, Cold War, and decolonization, as well as current environmental crisis.",Malgorzata Mazurek,11:40am,12:55pm,11663,,W2336-20261-001,,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2336-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261HIST2336W001,LECTURE

HIST UN2432,U.S. ERA OF CIVIL WAR & RECON,"It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of the American Civil War as an event in the making of the modern United States and, indeed, of the western world.  Indeed the American Civil War and Reconstruction introduced a whole series of dilemmas that are still with us.  What is the legacy of slavery in U.S. history and contemporary life?  What is the proper balance of power between the states and the central government? Who is entitled to citizenship in the United States?   What do freedom and equality mean in concrete terms?
  
This course surveys the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction in all of its aspects.  It focuses on the causes of the war in the divergent development of northern and southern states; the prosecution of the war and all that it involved, including the process of slave emancipation; and the contentious process of reconstructing the re-united states in the aftermath of Union victory.  The course includes the military history of the conflict, but ranges far beyond it to take the measure of the social and political changes the war unleashed.  It focuses on the Confederacy as well as the Union, on women as well as men, and on enslaved black people as well as free white people.  It takes the measure of large scale historical change while trying to grasp the experience of those human beings who lived through it.",Stephanie McCurry,11:40am,12:55pm,11671,,W2432-20261-001,U.S. ERA OF CIVIL WAR & R,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2432-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20261HIST2432W001,LECTURE

Most histories of the Republic equate the founding of the U.S. with the severance of colonial ties to Great Britain and the proceed to characterize America as a post-colonial society.

HIST UN3517,The Historical Imagination in Caribbean,"Caribbean literature offers complicated and vivid portrayals of the Caribbean’s past, and grapples with difficult histories lived by its people that compromised colonial archives can only partially capture. Literary works far exceed the limited narratives of Caribbean history by imagining entire worlds that official documents could never contain, rich selves, cultures and communities built by many generations of Caribbean people. This course is aimed at bringing forth a broader understanding of Caribbean history by examining a body of creative works by feminist and womanist writers that continuously remain attuned to the complexities of the past, which are either underrepresented or absent in the record. Chosen literary texts will also be paired with historical works that will illuminate and contextualize the multiple themes with which these Caribbean authors frequently engage, including slavery, and colonialism, racism and colorism, migration and immigration, gender and sexuality, poverty and globalization. From these pairings, students will explore both the divergences and alignments in how writers and historians approach the work of retelling the past, and will acquire reading and writing skills that will foster thoughtful critical analysis of the ever-changing contours of the Caribbean’s history.",Natasha J Lightfoot,2:10pm,4:00pm,11818,,W3517-20261-001,Hist Imagination Caribbea,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W3517-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20261HIST3517W001,SEMINAR

HIST UN3829,Citizenship: Regional and Global Histori,"This seminar explores the making and unmaking of citizenship, adopting regional and global histories from South Asia. Beginning with a brief overview of early twentieth century debates over imperial citizenship involving the Britain, its colonies, and North America and the making of a global color line in the years leading up to the formal end of empires, we look at how important political events (the 1947 Partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan, the 1971 War of independence for Bangladesh among others) were important inflection points in the rethinking of the relationship between national identity, belonging and formal-legal citizenship and its impact on people’s understanding of citizenship. Our discussions of citizenship after empire will include readings on citizenship debates involving the former Portuguese and French possessions in India in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a discussion of the broader debates over citizenship and belonging involving the South Asian diaspora in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. We will also look at how debates over indigeneity and authenticity mark citizenship debates in Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka as well as parts of Southeast Asia, and how this shapes global citizenship and refugee regimes. Returning to India, we consider how unmaking citizenship affects both people who stay behind and engage with state structures as well as those who are on the move, pursuing education or employment opportunities beyond it, shaped by uneven access to rights and shaping their social and political identities.",Kalyani Ramnath,2:10pm,4:00pm,14302,,W3829-20261-001,Citizenship in South Asia,History,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W3829-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20261HIST3829W001,SEMINAR

HROH GR5555,"Oral History & Justice: Memory, Power, a","This course will explore the ethics and politics of using oral history methods for documenting injustice, oppression, and human rights issues. The course is open to graduate students of oral history, human rights, journalism, and related fields; no prior experience with oral history interviewing is required. Oral history can be a powerful means of documenting oppression, human rights abuses, and crisis “from the bottom up” and facilitating the understanding and possible transformation of conditions of injustice. It can open the space for people and narratives that have been marginalized to challenge official narratives and complicate narrow accounts of injustice and crisis. The course will first explore what is distinct about oral history as a response to harm or injustice, comparing it to more familiar forms of testimony and narrative used within the realm of human rights, social justice organizations and courts of law. With its commitment to life narrative interviews and archival preservation, oral history situates injustice within the broader context of a life, a historical trajectory, and a political and cultural setting. Weaving together conceptual and practical approaches, we will examine different potential goals of oral history, such as documenting the experiences of people who have been marginalized; seeking justice; fostering dialogue and healing; and/or supporting activism and advocacy. The course covers interviewing skills and project planning specifically for oral history projects about injustice and human rights, and explores various dimensions of how power, politics, and ethics come into play — how politics and power shape the way a narrative is heard; the challenges of realizing ideals of collaboration and shared authority amid uneven power dynamics; contending with the effects of trauma on both narrators and interviewers; and critical considerations for projects produced with activist and advocacy aims. We will explore how oral history can work alongside other forms of memory and witnessing that go beyond words, such as activism, film, and memorials.",Suchitra Vijayan,2:10pm,4:00pm,11376,,G5555-20261-001,OH and Justice,Oral History,HROH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HROH/G5555-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,4,,M,20261HROH5555G001,SEMINAR

HRTS BC3935,"Power, Politics, and Procedure in US Imm","Immigration court has been described as akin to trying death penalty cases in traffic court. With a backlog of over two million cases and counting, judges have impossibly full dockets, cases get continued at the last minute, and many people are left to their own devices to try to make sense of what their options might be to stay in the United States. A key part of this confusion is because immigration court – though the stakes of decisions are as high as can be – is civil, not criminal. Given this, individuals are not guaranteed the right to a court appointed attorney. New York City, however, has been on the forefront of trying to remedy at least this part of the equation, piloting a unique program to guarantee representation to New Yorkers facing removal proceedings. While having access to an attorney can make a meaningful difference, immigration judges still enjoy wide discretion in how they decide a given case.
  
The core idea of this course is that there is a real utility to observing immigration court, both for research and for contributing to social change.  This course will center around a practice of court watching in immigration court in order to develop a scholarly analysis of systems, institutions, and the functioning (or not) of the law. At the same time, this court watching practice will also involve the systematic collection of qualitative data that may be directly useful to immigration attorneys and their clients in their perpetual effort to hold immigration courts accountable and create as fair as possible of a playing field that upholds the basic principles of human rights. To that end, in this class we will study how to conduct courtroom observations, drawing from different methodological approaches and findings, study the idea, history, and critiques of immigration law from across disciplines, and conduct extensive, in depth, immigration court watching. We will partner with local legal services organizations in order to sharpen our sense of what kinds of data is useful for their specific legal interventions and to ensure that the data that we do collect and interpret can become part of a larger project to hold courts accountable.
  
This course will offer students a unique opportunity to see how rigorous social science research and analysis can have real impacts in the world beyond the classroom, and how those two realms, through collaboration, can mutually contribute to advancing social change.

HRTS GU4460,Climate Justice,"The unfolding climate emergency occurs at the confluence of three global systems of domination – capitalism, racialized imperialism, and patriarchy. Premised as they are on exploitation, competition, and inequality rather than consideration, cooperation and balance, these systems of domination not only have caused the crisis but are seemingly unable to resolve it. Among the injustices of the contemporary impasse is the likelihood the people who have least benefited from the global (dis)order, and especially minorities in the global south, will be the worst affected casualties of climate change.
  
Encompassing a focus on equity and frameworks for accountability and redress, the human rights paradigm is a useful lens through which to analyze the emergency, exert accountability, and imagine better futures. It is against this backdrop that this interdisciplinary (climate science, law, politics, social science, development studies and anthropology) course on Climate Justice has been introduced to the Human Rights Studies MA program.
  
This 3-credit course addresses contemporary issues in the evolving discourse and epistemology of climate justice. How should we understand the climate emergency from a social justice perspective? What terminologies, discourses and paradigms are useful? How have individuals, non-government organizations and social movements sought to overcome climate change vulnerabilities and advance climate justice? What litigation, law and policy initiatives have been brought, and with what level of success? And what alternative models of living, working and being are conceivable for a more socially, ecologically, and existentially sustainable world?",Jacqueline Dugard,12:10pm,2:00pm,11293,,W4460-20261-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/W4460-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20261HRTS4460W001,SEMINAR

In doing so, we will examine how international humanitarian law and human rights law intersect. Both sets of legal norms are designed to protect the lives, well-being, and dignity of individuals.However, the condition of armed conflict provides a much wider set of options for governments and individuals to engage in violent, deadly action against others, including killing, forcibly detaining, and destroying the property of those designated as combatants.

This seminar explores the dynamics, contradictions and politics surrounding borders and surveillance, and borrows from the fields of film, architecture, art and urban studies to explore the effect on access to and formulations of human rights. To this end, we engage notions of biopolitics, racialization, exclusion/exception, necropolitics, coloniality, hospitality and securitization, among others. The course also engages visual and spatial methodologies and maps out everyday practices of resistance that seek to challenge, subvert or collapse the multifaceted violence of borders.
  
Taken together, this course provides an alternative to conventional scholarship on this subject. It engages with and provides an alternative to the mainstream literature to take for granted the inclusive and integrative character of nation-states.

HRTS UN3934,Seeking Sanctuary in New York City,"In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum – the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that of a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city’s long history of refuge? 
  
This course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection.
  
This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.",Jennifer Trowbridge,10:10am,12:00pm,00380,,V3934-20261-001,Seeking Sanctuary in New,Human Rights (HRTB),HRTS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/V3934-20261-001/,To be announced,,,5,,TF,20261HRTS3934V001,SEMINAR
HRTS UN3940,History of Human Rights,"This course provides students with an introduction to the history of human rights as a compelling, contested, and dynamic constellation of discourses, structures, and practices.  As a framework for articulating and pursuing justice at local, national, and global levels, human rights in the 21st century draw on the diverse histories of social movements, moral philosophy, legal institutions, and political maneuvers across the modern period.  Claimed most frequently when their violation is most egregious, the history of human rights is also a history of wrongs, with the changing nature and scope of oppression serving to provoke different kinds of human rights struggles.  Often invoked as timeless and universal standards, the history of human rights demonstrates their basic malleability, both in terms of which rights are recognized and who qualifies as human, and their fundamental contingency, both in terms of the precariousness of any human rights ‘victory’ and their potential for co-optation in the interests of power.  Finally, while this course is primarily concerned with the history of human rights, we will also consider the human rights of history, reflecting on the role of history and historical consciousness in the pursuit for justice.

HUMA UN2000,Core as Praxis/Fieldwork,"""The Core as Praxis/Fieldwork” provides students with the opportunity to explore the connections among texts from the Core Curriculum, their work in their major field of study, and their work in a professional environment outside of Columbia’s campus. Students will be guided through a process of reflection on the ideas and approaches that they develop in Core classes and in the courses in their major, to think about how they can apply theory to practice in the context of an internship or other experiential learning environment. Students will reread and revisit a text that they have studied previously in Literature Humanities or in Contemporary Civilization as the basis for their reading and writing assignments over the semester. 
To be eligible, students must (1) be engaged during the semester in an internship or other experiential learning opportunity, (2) have completed the sophomore year, and (3) have declared their major (or concentration)
. HUMAUN2000 may not be taken with the Pass/D/Fail option. All students will receive a letter grade for the course. Students can take HUMAUN2000 twice.",,,,10837,,S2000-20261-001,,Core (A&S),HUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HUMA/S2000-20261-001/,,On-Line Only,"Columbia College

IEOR E3404,SIMULATION MODELING AND ANALYSIS,"It is strongly advised that Stochastic modeling (IEOR E3106 or IEOR E4106) be taken before this course. This is an introductory course to simulation, a statistical sampling technique that uses the power of computers to study complex stochastic systems when analytical or numerical techniques do not suffice. The course focuses on discrete-event simulation, a general technique used to analyze a model over time and determine the relevant quantities of interest. Topics covered in the course include the generation of random numbers, sampling from given distributions, simulation of discrete-event systems, output analysis, variance reduction techniques, goodness of fit tests, and the selection of input distributions. The first half of the course is oriented toward the design and implementation of algorithms, while the second half is more theoretical in nature and relies heavily on material covered in prior probability courses. The teaching methodology consists of lectures, recitations, weekly homework, and both in-class and take-home exams. Homework almost always includes a programming component for which students are encouraged to work in teams.",Yi Zhang,5:40pm,6:55pm,13270,,E3404-20261-001,SIMULATION MODELING AND ANALYS,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IEOR/E3404-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Engineering:Undergraduate,4,"IEOR E3106

IFEP IA7650,Central Bank Crisis Management,"The extraordinary policy responses of global central banks to the 2023 banking turmoil, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2007-2009 financial crisis have fostered debate about both the appropriateness and the effectiveness of central bank actions.   This course will discuss the theory and practice of “unconventional” monetary policy tools – i.e., those used to address financial crises, widespread deflation, and deep recessions or depressions.  Examples in the course will be drawn from a broad array of crises, countries, and central banks in both the developed and emerging world over many decades. 
  
 The bulk of the course will focus on how central banks adapt their policy rules and tools in response to extraordinary financial or economic turmoil. Different types of monetary policy tools will be discussed and analyzed, with particular focus on the design and the effectiveness of various crisis policy tools.  Central to understanding policy effectiveness will be consideration of how financial and macroeconomic conditions impact central bank policy design,  and in turn, how financial markets and the macroeconomy respond to extraordinary policies. 
  
Examples of the use of crisis management tools – both more and less successful – across jurisdictions will be discussed in the latter half of the course.   The course finishes with discussions of several important and timely dilemmas: Where is the “line” between crisis monetary policies and traditional fiscal policy actions?  Why was the (inflation) impact of COVID-19 policy responses so different from previous episodes of instability?   How do central bank “undo” their crisis management policies and return to “normal”?  What difficulties do central banks face in handling economic side effects and the political consequences of extraordinary policies?",Patricia C Mosser,,,10318,,U7650-20261-001,Central Bank Crisis Manag,International Finance & Economic Policy,IFEP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IFEP/U7650-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261IFEP7650U001,SEMINAR

IFEP IA7820,Economic Measurement of Discrimination,"Discrimination is the differential treatment of people based on identity or perceived identity (race, gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ status, age, religion, disability, immigration status, etc.). Such behavior violates some legal, social, and moral norms and has a negative impact on those discriminated against.
  
For these and other reasons, it is important to be able to formally identify discrimination from data. But how do we know that A’s treatment of B is because of B’s identity as opposed to some other characteristic of B or A that we may not even have a variable for?
  
In this class, we will explore economists’ methodologies for answering this question. We will survey the economic literature on discrimination against a variety of types of people in a variety of markets and across countries. Students are encouraged to explore discrimination in contexts not covered in the reading in their final projects.",Ebonya L Washington,,,10320,,U7820-20261-001,Econ Measures-Discriminat,International Finance & Economic Policy,IFEP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IFEP/U7820-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261IFEP7820U001,SEMINAR

IKNS PS5986,SPECIAL TOPICS: Getting AI Right for Tec,"OVERVIEW:
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming every sector of human activity—from healthcare and education to defense and diplomacy—presenting both risks and opportunities and raising urgent questions about ethics, governance, global stability, and even civilizational churn. This course explores AI as both a technological and geopolitical force, one that has considerable societal impact in reshaping institutions, economies, and even civilization itself. Rather than approaching the topic from a technical perspective, the course is designed for students across disciplines who seek to understand how AI and convergent technologies can be developed and governed responsibly in a time of unprecedented change.
  
 
  
CONTENT:
 
Students will examine AI not as a set of tools but as an evolving infrastructure of global order. The course integrates ethical reasoning, policy analysis, and systems thinking to investigate how to get AI right in an era of rapid techno-social transformation. Students will explore foundational frameworks for AI governance and regulation (e.g., EU AI Act); analyze how the convergence of emerging technologies drives innovation and reshapes industries (e.g., autonomous vehicles); understand the role of AI within the larger context of human innovation; debate the rise of sovereign AI as a geopolitical force (e.g., UAE’s ‘Falcon’, Singapore’s ‘SEA-LION’ models.); evaluate AI’s potential role in both civilizational collapse and societal resilience; and apply methods of strategic foresight to anticipate future emerging technologies (e.g., the work of Sachs, Acemoglu & Robinson, Spengler etc.). Final projects will synthesize technical, ethical, and geopolitical perspectives to design a Responsible AI framework relevant to students’ personal and professional contexts.

IKNS PS5988,Human-Centered Design for Data-Driven St,"Within this course, students will explore how practices from human-centered design (HCD) can be applied to the end-to-end data science workflow—problem (use case) definition, data collection & preparation, data exploration, data modeling, and communicating and visualizing the results— in order to build trust in data that is used to drive strategy and decision making and impact organizational change. Students will learn about fundamental human values and how methods from the behavioral sciences and HCD can inspire ethical use of data to drive strategy and change in the modern, data-driven workplace. Students will understand how keeping “humans in the loop” is beneficial, and they will develop a critical eye for assessing whether the data they rely on to make decisions at work is human-centric, particularly as we become more reliant on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to inform our insights, strategies, and decision making at work.
  
 Content & Goals: Through hands-on, project-based work, students will work individually and in project teams to practice designing human-centric information and communication experiences, leveraging audience-focused data visualizations and storytelling techniques to drive a strategic workplace objective, motivating leaders and employees into action to create traceable organizational impact that benefits people. Students will have an opportunity to practice their writing and presentation skills through practical course assignments.
  
 Logistics: This graduate-level elective course is designed for students in Information & Knowledge Strategy but is open to other students at Columbia University.

IKNS PS5990,NAVIGATING THE FUTURE OF WORK,"This course is designed to provide an understanding of the critical capabilities necessary for individual, team, and organizational success in the new world of work. Based upon current economic models, students will recognize the intangible factors within teams and organizations that drive decision making, knowledge, and culture as value and valuation of the work of organizations.
  
Our core question is, how to start, build, and sustain leadership and organization capabilities for successfully navigating the future of work? The course will answer this question by looking at successful case examples who are demonstrably leading the way. We will bring actual leaders and entrepreneurs to the class for exchange with our class. The course will require students to work individually and in teams to build their own future of work models through unlearning and learning.
  
Students will study modern exemplar organizations and leaders to harness their lessons for staying competitive and successful. We will explore the changing nature of work, provide the means for better understanding what is occurring, and develop strategies for successfully navigating this new world. This course will start by analyzing how platforms, robotics, AI, automation, data, digitization, and the speed of technology has changed work. The capabilities necessary for success require both technological expertise, as well as, human skill centered around leadership, knowledge, and cultures of trust, respect and intentional inclusion. Students will participate in an “intangibles” assessment survey that will measure behaviors associated with leadership, culture, and knowledge for driving performance. This approach allows for exploring how the intangible factors behind each of these change factors impact the world of work, workforces, and workplaces.
  
Assignments will include determining individual work interests, skills and connecting them to organizational objectives and key results (OKR).

IKNS PS5994,A Systems Approach to Knowledge Manageme,"This course will equip students with skills and strategies on how to plan, design, develop and deploy knowledge management programs for different types of organizations as well as for different sectors of the global economy. A hallmark of the course’s approach is that students will learn the steps from planning to deployment from a systems standpoint, i.e., students will learn how to use systems engineering principles as an analytic and structured framework for designing and implementing knowledge management programs that are responsive to organizational needs. 
  
The course first provides an overview of the strategic value of institutional and project knowledge when properly managed, shared and applied, or leveraged to support decision making.  Next, a system’s view and analysis of knowledge management (KM) is introduced as critical to business success because of the strategic value of knowledge assets. The knowledge management “system” as used in this course comprises of all the organizational elements that go into formulating a knowledge management strategy and its related implementation programs. Such system is made up of a defined KM strategy, appropriate information technology (IT) tools, processes, teams and leadership engagements, implementation programs delivery, institutional learning, lessons learned, knowledge sharing and transfer methodologies. Further, students will learn how to conduct organizational KM needs assessment, define institutional KM drivers, strategy formulation and knowledge sharing protocols. Students will also acquire skills for developing robust knowledge management practices and programs that support business objectives, enable project success, and sustain improved organizational performance. Additionally, students will apply the structured KM design principles they learned to real-world organizational challenges and opportunities. Assignments comprise a combination of individual exercises, a group project, and a final exam.

Part II focuses on counterterrorism, including U.S. policy responses, international strategies, and the tension between security and democratic values.",Stuart M Gottlieb,,,10322,,U7150-20261-001,Terrorism and Counterterr,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7150-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7150U001,LECTURE
ISDI IA7200,Conduct of War,"The conduct of war is central to international security policy. Even when unused, the ability to wage war effectively underpins deterrence and shapes foreign policy. Military organization, training, and strategy are built around this capacity, and the institutions that support it exist largely to ensure effectiveness in conflict. A strong grasp of modern warfare theory and practice is essential for anyone pursuing a career in security policy. This course provides a foundation in the conduct of war, preparing students for professional roles in government agencies, legislative offices, think tanks, and international organizations. It focuses on developing the analytical skills and conceptual tools needed for early-career success and long-term growth in the defense policy field. While the course includes critical thinking and key concepts, it is intended as targeted professional preparation rather than general education. The course complements ISDI IA6000: Foundations of International Security Policy, ISDI IA7250: Military Technology Assessment, and ISDI IA7275: Methods for Defense Analysis. While these courses may be taken independently, this course does not address topics such as war’s causes, ethics, or technology evaluation, which are covered elsewhere. Instead, it concentrates on the theory and practice of how wars are conducted.",,,,10323,,U7200-20261-001,,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7200-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,"ISDI IA6000

ISDI IA7204,The Politics of Defense in the United St,"This course examines how national security and defense policy are developed and implemented in the U.S., focusing on political processes and institutional dynamics. Topics include military strategy, budgeting, force structure, acquisition, personnel policy, and the use of force. Students explore five key dimensions: partisan politics, Congress–Executive relations, civil-military relations, inter-service dynamics, and coordination across federal agencies. While grounded in U.S. policy, the course addresses global contexts and current debates, including defense reform, great-power competition, and the sustainability of the all-volunteer force. Readings span historical and contemporary sources.",Michael O'Hanlon,,,10324,,U7204-20261-001,Politics of U.S. Defense,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7204-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7204U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7250,Military Technology Assessment,"Technology is central to modern defense debates in the United States and globally. Its assessment underpins core functions across the defense policy and planning community, including budgeting, modernization, intelligence, campaign planning, force design, and program management. In the U.S., this work spans think tanks, Defense Department offices, Congressional and Service staffs, the intelligence community, and the defense industry. These assessments influence hundreds of billions in spending and carry life-and-death stakes in wartime.
  
The demand for analysts with the ability to assess military technology is high. Thousands perform or rely on this work, making it a critical and widely applicable skill for early- and mid-career professionals in the defense field.
  
This course prepares students for that work by introducing the fundamentals of military technology and its analysis in policymaking contexts. It does not assume prior technical background, nor is it an engineering course. Instead, it focuses on how technologies function and interact under design constraints, and how to assess their operational utility.
  
The course complements other SIPA security courses, especially 
The Conduct of War
 and 
Methods for Defense Policy Analysis
. It does not cover broader strategic or policy debates, which are addressed elsewhere in the curriculum. While the course can stand alone, it is most useful when paired with related coursework.",Stephen Biddle,,,10325,,U7250-20261-001,Military Technology Asses,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7250-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7250U001,SEMINAR

Drawing on the instructor’s experience leading UN peacekeeping operations and conflict resolution initiatives, the course explores case studies from various regions, including Rwanda, Bosnia, Libya, Syria, Colombia, Ukraine, and Israel-Palestine. Students will analyze how geopolitical shifts, institutional capacities, and strategic choices have influenced outcomes. The course pays particular attention to the United Nations' involvement, the evolution of doctrines such as the Responsibility to Protect, and the role of external actors.",Jean-Marie Guehenno,,,10326,,U7300-20261-001,Peacemaking: Lessons & Fa,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7300-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7300U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7350,Gender and International Security,"Gender has important implications for international security policy. Gender bias can influence policy choices, distort understandings of military capability—especially among nonstate armed groups with women combatants—and aggravate the causes of war. It can increase internal and interstate violence in settings where women are mistreated or where sex imbalances create instability. Gender also shapes how individuals experience wars and disasters, as existing inequalities are often intensified. Bias can discourage women from pursuing careers in security policy, limiting states’ access to a full range of talent.
  
The intersection of gender and security has been formally recognized since the 2000 passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS). International organizations such as NATO have developed WPS policies, and the United States passed the Women, Peace, and Security Act in 2017 to integrate gender into the work of the State and Defense Departments.
  
This course offers a sustained exploration of how gender identities and related power dynamics influence international and internal conflict, as well as security policy. Through case studies and examples, students will learn to conduct gender analyses and apply these skills through research, writing, and presentations. The course is structured as a discussion-based seminar to support collaborative learning.
  
The course begins by defining gender and international security and examining why these concepts are difficult to define. Later sessions address the intersection of gender with other identity factors, explore how security institutions are gendered, and consider how to create gender-responsive policies. The course concludes by analyzing gendered strategies in conflict and state responses to conflict.",Phoebe Donnelly,,,10327,,U7350-20261-001,Gender & Int'l Security,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7350-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7350U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7395,History for Future Policymakers,"This course examines the uses and misuses of historical analysis in policymaking and strategic thinking. Although leaders often invoke historical analogies, they tend to rely on a limited set of familiar episodes. Students will explore the value and limitations of using history to inform decisions about present and future challenges. The course introduces key tools of historical reasoning, including concepts such as continuity and change, contingency, human agency, and structural constraint. Students will also consider the risks of overreliance on analogy or using history to support predetermined conclusions. The goal is to deepen understanding of frequently cited historical examples while encouraging more original and critical approaches to thinking about the future.",Sarah C Kovner,,,10328,,U7395-20261-001,History for Future Policy,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7395-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7395U001,SEMINAR

ISDI IA7406,United Nations and Globalization,"United Nations and Globalization
 introduces the various ways in which the United Nations affect global governance. Over the last decade, every aspect of global governance has become subjected to review and debate: peacekeeping and peacebuilding, the future of humanitarianism, a new climate change architecture, human rights, a new sustainable development agenda, and the need for a new understanding of multilateralism.
  
Part 1
 of this course introduces the different actors, entities, and platforms through which the UN affects global governance. It creates the conceptual foundations for the role of international organizations in today’s multiplex world. It sheds light on how the UN acts at various levels, in different forms and with a varied set of partners to foster global public goods and global public policy. This includes discussions on the role of international law, goal setting, and frameworks, as well as the interlinkages between global-level interventions and regional, national, and local activities and outcomes.
  
Part 2
 applies the conceptual insights to specific issue areas. Discussions on global governance mechanisms in the areas of peace and security, humanitarian action, sustainable development, climate change, human rights, gender, migration, global health, and COVID-19 deepen the understanding of the role the UN plays in global governance regimes more broadly.
  
In addition to critical scholarship on international organizations and global governance, the course relies on students’ analysis of relevant proceedings and debates at the UN, original policy documents, as well as expert testimony from a range of guest speakers, who share their extensive first-hand observations as actors of global governance processes. By these means, 
United Nations and Globalization
 offers insights into the processes, challenges, and impacts of UN activities to make global governance regimes stronger, more effective, and hold actors more accountable.",Daniel Naujoks,,,10331,,U7406-20261-001,United Nations & Globaliz,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7406-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7406U001,SEMINAR

ISDI IA7502,Foundations of Cyber Conflict,"This course explores the strategic, policy, and institutional dimensions of cyber conflict. It focuses on the national security implications of cyber threats and responses, rather than the technical mechanics of cyberspace. Students will examine how cyber operations unfold at both tactical and strategic levels, assess the comparison of cyber power to other domains of conflict, and trace the development of U.S. cyber policy and organizational structures. There are no prerequisites, though students without prior exposure to cybersecurity are encouraged to complete the assigned foundational readings before the first class or take a 1.5-credit introductory course.",Jason Healey,,,10334,,U7502-20261-001,Foundations of Cyber Conf,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7502-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7502U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7508,Cyberspace in Modern Warfare,"This course examines the evolving role of cyberspace in modern warfare. Since the emergence of the Internet, scholars and policymakers have debated whether cyber capabilities represent a fundamental shift in the nature of conflict or a complement to conventional military power. Students will engage key conceptual debates about cyber conflict, assess how major powers including the United States, Israel, Russia, and China develop and employ cyber capabilities, and consider whether cyber operations should be viewed as a distinct strategic domain. The course also explores the future of cyber warfare, including the role of non-state actors and the integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and space-based systems. Through case studies and policy analysis, students will develop a framework for understanding how cyber strategy is shaped and executed in theory and practice.",Erica D Lonergan,,,10335,,U7508-20261-001,Cyberspace in Modern Warf,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7508-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7508U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7510,Cyber Risks and Vulnerabilities,"The purpose of this course is to familiarize SIPA students with the function of the internet while focusing on the flaws and vulnerabilities that can be exploited in attacks or impact user privacy.  This course will approach each session in the following manner: discussion of recent cyber events, discussion topic(s) to be covered, and the ramifications when used in the real world.
  
This course is intended to build on the Basics of Cybersecurity with a tighter focus on specific vulnerabilities and information transmission and how these can be exploited by hackers, criminals, spies, militaries, or business interests.
  
This course is intended to be an introduction to cyber risk and vulnerabilities and is thus suitable for complete newcomers to the area. It is a big field, with a lot to cover; however, this should get students familiar with all of the basics.  The class is divided into weekly topics; the first five iteratively build on each other, and the others either addressing recent technologies or hosting relevant guest speakers.
  
Many cyber jobs are opening up with companies that need international affairs analysts who, while not cybersecurity experts, understand the topic well enough to write policy recommendations or intelligence briefs.  Even if you don’t intend your career to focus on cyber issues, having some exposure will deepen your understanding of the dynamics of many other international, privacy, and public policy issues.",Elizabeth Cartier,,,10336,,U7510-20261-001,Cyber Risks and Vulnerabi,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7510-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7510U001,SEMINAR

Topics include incident response, supply chain vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance, critical infrastructure, and cyber conflict. Through policy memos and a group-designed risk taxonomy, students build practical tools for evaluating and managing cyber threats in public, private, and nonprofit sectors.",,,,10337,,U7512-20261-001,Cybersecurity & Business,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7512-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7512U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7524,Cyberspace in Strategy and Grand Strateg,"This course examines the role of cyberspace in national strategy and grand strategy, with a primary focus on the United States and select comparative cases. As the United States shifts from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency toward renewed great power competition, questions about the utility of force, alliance structures, economic statecraft, and international institutions are increasingly framed by strategic thinking. Although cyberspace influences nearly all instruments of national power, its role in debates about grand strategy remains underexplored. This course addresses that gap by evaluating how traditional concepts of strategy and grand strategy apply in the digital domain. Students will assess how cyberspace shapes the formulation and execution of strategy through military operations, diplomacy, intelligence, and economic tools.",Erica D Lonergan,,,10338,,U7524-20261-001,Cyberspace & Grand Strate,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7524-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7524U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7625,Conflict Resolution,"This course introduces the study and practice of international conflict resolution, providing students with a broad understanding of the subject and a framework for approaching more specific strands of study offered by CICR. Can a war be stopped before it starts? Is it realistic to talk about ‘managing’ a war and mitigating its consequences? What eventually brings adversaries to the negotiating table? How do mediation efforts unfold and how are the key issues resolved? Why do peace processes and peace agreements so often fail to bring durable peace? Students will address these and other fundamental questions in order to develop an understanding of international conflict resolution.",,,,10339,,U7625-20261-001,,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7625-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7625U001,SEMINAR

Complementing other CICR courses, it offers students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of how various mediators—including the United Nations, multilateral institutions, states, and non-governmental organizations—are responding to shifting dynamics in global conflict and politics.
  
The course considers key questions: What factors hinder current conflict resolution efforts? How have mediators adapted to changes in geopolitics, the fragmentation of non-state armed groups, and a crowded mediation landscape? How should they continue to adapt, especially amid declining resources for peace and humanitarian efforts and growing resistance to established norms?
  
Students will also examine how mediators can engage conflict parties on emerging issues, including the effects of the climate crisis and digital technologies on conflict dynamics and peace processes.",Teresa Whitfield,,,10340,,U7630-20261-001,Mediation in a World in F,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7630-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,1.5,,,20261ISDI7630U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA7664,Applied Peacebuilding and Conflict Resol,"This course prepares students to engage in peacebuilding practice by developing fieldwork-related competencies rooted in critical reflection, professional strategy, and ethical engagement. Students examine foundational values, frameworks, and dilemmas in the peacebuilding field, while cultivating skills in project design, monitoring and evaluation (MEAL), communication, collaboration, and cultural awareness.
  
Structured as the first part of a spring-summer-fall sequence, the course introduces peacebuilding theory and practice through seminar-style discussions and applied assignments. Students collaborate with vetted field-based partner institutions to design projects aligned with real-world needs. These projects are implemented through optional summer internships, followed by a fall debrief session with the incoming cohort.
  
Coursework emphasizes partnership with local actors, conflict sensitivity, reflective practice, and an openness to critique and adaptation. Students are expected to grapple with the complexity of field conditions and to develop strategies for self-care, ethical engagement, and navigating uncertainty. Assignments include reflective journals, a midterm conflict analysis and thematic research paper, and a final project design paper.

Building on themes from the fall, the spring semester focuses on the challenges confronting a new U.S. presidential administration and the strategic decisions that will shape American leadership in a contested international environment. Through a combination of seminar discussions, case studies, guest speakers, and two regional crisis simulations, students will examine U.S. policy responses to geopolitical competition, regional instability, and transnational threats. Enrollment is limited to students in the International Fellows Program (IFP).",Victoria Nuland,,,10345,,U7902-20261-001,U.S. Role in World Affair,International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U7902-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI7902U001,SEMINAR
ISDI IA8878,"Nuclear Theory, Politics, and Strategies","Nuclear weapons are often considered to pose humanity’s gravest danger. Yet despite nuclear threats and crises, states have managed to avoid the deliberate or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons since the end of World War II. Eighty years after Hiroshima, how has nuclear war been avoided? Did the advent of nuclear weapons create a revolution in military affairs that stalemated major powers and dramatically reduced the prospects of great power war by the emergence of mutual vulnerability and mutual assured destruction (MAD) postures? Or are nuclear weapons central to great power competition and valuable instruments of force, including for deterrence and coercion? Is there a taboo against nuclear use? Do the major theories about the nuclear era match actual practice and how has nuclear theory evolved? Are the strategies and approaches that were employed in the past still appropriate for the new multipolar nuclear age? Why do some states acquire nuclear weapons while others that have considered going nuclear (e.g., South Korea and Germany) so far forego the option, while still others (e.g., South Africa and Ukraine) have given up their nuclear weapons? What are the prospects for continued nuclear proliferation and hedging (e.g., Iran)?
  
This class will explore past and current patterns of behavior among existing, potential, and former nuclear weapons states. Other questions that animate this course include: What do nuclear weapons actually deter? Can they be used for coercion? How do operational plans and force postures serve military and political objectives? What are the incentives, disincentives and risks of strategies premised on deliberate escalation to nuclear use? Do they increase the probability of inadvertent use of nuclear weapons? What role do nuclear weapons play in U.S. strategy and security policies? How does the U.S. experience compare to those of other nuclear weapon states, such as USSR/Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea? This seminar will examine such questions to gain a better understanding of the importance of nuclear weapons for international relations.",Cynthia A Roberts,,,10346,,U8878-20261-001,"Nuclear Theory, Politics,",International Security & Diplomacy,ISDI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ISDI/U8878-20261-001/,,In-Person,SIPA,3,,,20261ISDI8878U001,SEMINAR

popular culture in the last quarter of the Twentieth Century is a Jewish-American. Steven
  
Spielberg’s uncanny grasp of visual storytelling and his auteurist signature can be found
  
on every film he has directed, as well as many he has produced. This course will analyze
  
the content and formal construction of Spielberg’s films by following their thematic
  
through-lines – family ties (strained and healthy), the implacable threat, humanity at war,
  
man vs. the natural world, the child’s perspective, Jewish identity and others – in films as
  
disparate as Jaws and The Color Purple.
  
Each class meeting will include a complete screening of a feature film directed by Steven
  
Spielberg, as well as clips of related films by Spielberg. Readings will include critical
  
essays, histories, and interviews which elaborate on in-class screenings and cover
  
additional topics and films. Written assignments will be three analytical essays which
  
will encourage critical thinking, close analysis of film texts, and independent research

JWST GU4159,"Antisemitism and Resistance in Europe, t","In this course, we will not only analyze some of the key antisemitic texts and ideas of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but also consider the impact of antisemitism on Jewish lived experience in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe and the ways in which Jewish people and communities have responded to and confronted antisemitism in all three regions.
  
 
  
Antisemitism permeates the histories of nationalism, colonialism, and religion in ways that cross borders and cultures. Often, predominantly European phenomena – from the myth of ritual murder to fascist racism – have meaningfully informed Middle Eastern and North African antisemitism. Jewish resistance movements in all three regions, meanwhile, have relied and built upon one another: Middle Eastern Jews called upon European Jewish leaders to help them confront the anti-Jewish policies of colonial bureaucracies, and North African Jewish partisans rescued European Jewish refugees during World War II. These regions, however, are typically studied in isolation from one another. In this course, we will seek to arrive at an understanding of the interconnectedness of these histories.
  
 
  
Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Jewish life in these regions was radically transformed. Many longstanding Jewish communities – whole worlds of culture and human life – were ultimately destroyed. In our own time of rampant, well-documented antisemitism, it is especially important to learn about not only the history of antisemitism itself, but also the myriad successes and failures of those who, at every moment, found ways to resist. By learning about the past, we inherit the collective wisdom of those who have engaged with these issues before us; this may, in turn, help us to make well-informed, thoughtful decisions in the present and for the future.",,,,12693,,W4159-20261-001,Antisemitism and Resistan,Institute for Israel & Jewish Studies,JWST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/JWST/W4159-20261-001/,,In-Person,,4,,,20261JWST4159W001,SEMINAR

KORN BC2345,Introduction to Korean Society: Explorin,"This introductory lecture course introduces students with little or no prior knowledge of Korea or the
 Korean language to Korean society by exploring cultural codes—shared symbols, values, and practices
 that shape everyday life—through the lens of media and literature. By engaging with short stories, films,
 TV shows, music, and other cultural texts, students will examine how these cultural codes influence
 Korean social norms, identities, and global representations.
 The course focuses on six key cultural codes—food, language, family structure, religion, economic
 development, and the two Koreas—as reflected in Korean literature, film, drama, and YouTube content.
 Through these themes, students will gain a foundational yet comprehensive understanding of Korean
 society. At the same time, they will strengthen their critical and analytical skills in interpreting culture,
 cultivating a deeper awareness of how meaning is constructed and communicated across different media.",Hwanhee Kim,1:10pm,2:25pm,00903,,X2345-20261-001,Introduction to Korean So,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,KORN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/KORN/X2345-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261KORN2345X001,LECTURE

It provides a forum in which the entire community of dissertation writers meets, bridging the departments different fields and regions of research. It complements workshops outside the department focused on one area or theme. Through an encounter with the diversity of research underway in MESAAS, participants learn to engage with work anchored in different regions and disciplines and discover or develop what is common in the departments post-disciplinary methods of inquiry. Since the community is relatively small, it is expected that all post-M.Phil. students in residence will join the colloquium. Post M.Phil. students from other departments may request permission to join the colloquium, but places for non-MESAAS students will be limited.

MDES GU4532,Beyond Human in Modern Hebrew Literature,"“The possibility of pogroms,” claims Theodor Adorno, “is decided in the moment when the gaze of a fatally-wounded animal falls on a human being. The defiance with which he repels this gaze—’after all it's only an animal’—reappears irresistibly in cruelties done to human beings.” This course traces the development of Modern Hebrew literature, from its fin-de-siècle revival to contemporary Israeli fiction, through the prism of animality and animalization. We will focus on human-animal relations and animalization/dehumanization of humans in literary works by prominent Hebrew authors, including M.Y. Berdichevsky, Devorah Baron, S.Y. Agnon, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Orly Castel-Bloom, Almog Behar, Etgar Keret, and Sayed Kashua. Employing posthumanist and ecofeminist theoretical lenses, we will analyze the bio-political intersections of species and gender, as well as animalization as a process of otherization of marginalized ethnic groups. Throughout the course, we will ask questions, such as: why animals abound in Modern Hebrew literature? Are they merely metaphors for intra-human issues, or rather count as subjects? What literary devices are used to portray animals? How has the depiction of human-animal relations changed in Hebrew over the last 150 years? How do cultural and political frameworks inform representations of human-animal relations? No prior knowledge of Hebrew is required; all readings and class discussions will be in English.

MDES GU4655,India after 1947: Democracy and Majorita,"This course will explore recent histories of post-independence India, focusing on the first three decades of independence (1947-1977) following the end of British colonial rule. Until rather recently, most histories of South Asia concluded with independence, casting, perhaps unconsciously, the end of British rule as the end of history in the region. However, in recent years, we have witnessed a boom of historical writing on post-independence India.  In this class, we will analyze this emerging scholarship and focus on the themes of democracy and majoritarianism. We will read about the establishment of universal franchise in 1950s India, the writing and implementation of the constitution, and the country’s experiments with various economic plans. At the same time, we will study the Indian state’s often violent integration of regions originally outside Britain’s direct domain, including the princely states of Kashmir and Hyderabad, and the development of what scholars have described as new forms of colonialism in the region after 1947. Likewise
,
 we will study the growth of majoritarian ideologies and the continued struggle against caste oppression, all while considering India’s place in the larger Cold War. Throughout the class, we will remain attendant to aesthetic developments in media and literature during this period. While the course focuses on India—or more specifically on various communities’ interactions with the Indian state—we will also study developments in Pakistan (and Bangladesh after 1971) and other neighboring states, recognizing that their shared histories did not end with Partition.",Isabel Huacuja Alonso,2:10pm,4:00pm,12044,,W4655-20261-001,India after 1947: Democra,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W4655-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20261MDES4655W001,SEMINAR

MDES UN1630,Introduction to South Asia,"This course introduces students to South Asia through
 an analysis of the heterogeneity, richness, and
 complexity of the region’s conflicted pasts. Our
 historical scope is vast and ambitious, starting with the
 earliest urban settlements in about 2000BCE and
 ending in the present. Though focused on “South
 Asia,” the course problematizes the bounded areal
 model by emphasizing the region’s enduring
 connections to Eurasia, Africa, Southeast Asia, and
 the broader Indian Ocean world. With connected
 history as our method, the course asks students to
 grapple with South Asia’s literary, religious, and
 political histories as kinetic processes. This allows us to
 ask probing questions about issues that have had, and
 continue to have, major implications for the region––
 and the world––today: sovereignty, power, gender,

MDES UN2000,"ETHNICITY, RACE, IDENTITY IN THE PRE-MOD","This seminar investigates the concepts of ethnicity, race, and identity, in both theory and practice,
 through a comparative survey of several case studies from the Pre-Modern history of the Middle East.
 The course focuses on symbols of identity and difference, interpreting them through a variety of
 analytical tools, and evaluating the utility of each as part of an ongoing exploration of the subject. The
 survey considers theories of ethnicity and race, as well as their critics, and includes cases from the
 Ancient World (c. 1000 BCE) through the Old Regime (c. 1800 CE).
  
 Students in this course will gain a familiarity with major theories of social difference and alterity, and
 utilize them to interpret and analyze controversial debates about social politics and identity from the
 history of the Middle East, including ancient ethnicity, historical racism, Arab identity, pluralism in the
 Islamic Empire, and slavery, among others. In addition, students will spend much of the semester
 developing a specialized case study of their own on a historical community of interest. All of the case
 studies will be presented in a showcase at the end of the semester.

MDES UN2399,ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LITERATURE,"This colloquium is a course on many influential texts of literature from Ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Sumerian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Canaanite, and others. The emphasis is on investigating the literary traditions of each culture – the subject matter, form, methods, and symbolism– that distinguish them from one another and from later traditions of the Middle East. The course is not
 a “civilization” course, nor is it a history class, although elements of culture and history will be mentioned as necessary. The course is intended to provide a facility with, and an awareness of, the content and context of ancient works of literature in translation from the Ancient Middle East.
  
 Students in this course will gain a familiarity with the major cultures of the Ancient Middle East, the best known and most remarked upon stories, and the legacy of those works on some later traditions. The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.

MDES UN3121,LITERATURE&CULTURES OF STRUGGLE IN S.AFR,"Generations of resistance have shaped contemporary life in South Africa -- in struggles against colonialism, segregation, the legislated racism known as apartheid, and the entrenched inequalities of the post-apartheid era. Two constants in this history of struggle have been youth as a vanguard of liberation movements and culture as a weapon of struggle. As new generation of South African youth -- the born frees -- has now taken to the streets and social media to decolonize the university and claim their education as a meaningful right, this course traces the ways that generations of writers, artists, and activists have faced censorship, exile, and repression in an ongoing struggle to dismantle apartheid and to free the mind, the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor according to Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko. This course traces the profoundly important roles that literature and other cultural production (music, photography, film, comics, Twitter hashtags like #rhodesmustfall and #feesmustfall) have played in struggle against apartheid and its lingering afterlife. Although many of our texts were originally written in English, we will also discuss the historical forces, including nineteenth-century Christian missions and Bantu Education, as well as South Africas post-1994 commitment to being a multilingual democracy, that have shaped the linguistic texture of South African cultural life.",Jennifer Wenzel,2:40pm,3:55pm,14220,,W3121-20261-001,LITERATURE&CULTURES OF ST,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W3121-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261MDES3121W001,LECTURE
MDES UN3260,RETHINKING MIDDLE EAST POLITCS,"This course examines a set of questions that have shaped the study of the politics of the modern Middle East. It looks at the main ways those questions have been answered, exploring debates both in Western academic scholarship and among scholars and intellectuals in the region itself. For each question, the course offers new ways of thinking about the issue or ways of framing it in different terms. The topics covered in the course include: the kinds of modern state that emerged in the Middle East and the ways its forms of power and authority were shaped; the birth of economic development as a way of describing the function and measuring the success of the state, and the changing metrics of this success; the influence of oil on the politics of the region; the nature and role of Islamic political movements; the transformation of the countryside and the city and the role of rural populations and of urban protest in modern politics; and the politics of armed force and political violence in the region, and the ways in which this has been understood. The focus of the course will be on the politics of the twentieth century, but many topics will be traced back into developments that occurred in earlier periods, and several will be explored up to the present. The course is divided into four parts, each ending with a paper or exam in which participants are asked to analyze the material covered. Each part of the course has a geographical focus on a country or group of countries and a thematic focus on a particular set of questions of historical and political analysis.",Timothy Mitchell,10:10am,11:25am,11743,,W3260-20261-001,RETHINKING MIDDLE EAST PO,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W3260-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20261MDES3260W001,LECTURE

MDES UN3331,URBAN SPACE & CONFLICT IN MIDDLE EAST,"This course explores how civil war, revolution, militarization, mass violence, refugee crises, and terrorism impact urban spaces, and how city dwellers engage in urban resilience, negotiate and attempt to reclaim their right to the city. Through case studies of Beirut (1975-present), Baghdad (2003-present), Cairo (2011-present), Diyarbakir (1914-present), Aleppo (1914-present), and Jerusalem (1914-present), this course traces how urban life adjusted to destruction (and post-conflict reconstruction), violence, and anarchy; how neighborhoods were reshaped; and how local ethnic, religious, and political dynamics played out in these cities and metropolises. Relying on multi-disciplinary and post-disciplinary scholarship, and employing a wealth of audiovisual material, literary works, and interviews conducted by the instructor, the course scrutinizes how conflicts have impacted urban life in the Middle East, and how civilians react to, confront, and resist militarization in urban spaces.",Khatchig Mouradian,4:10pm,6:00pm,12092,,W3331-20261-001,URBAN SPACE & CONFLICT IN,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W3331-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

NECR K5330,Special Topics: Consulting on Organizati,"Conflicts in organizations can be productive or destructive, depending on the nature, frequency and intensity of the conflicts and how they are managed. When handled well, they can spark dialogue and innovation. Too often, however, they are not managed well and can have adverse effects on the people directly and indirectly involved, and the organization itself. They can cause absenteeism and lack of commitment, which can reduce productivity and increase the costs of doing business. They create unpleasant working environments and, when prolonged, can cause stress resulting in emotional and physical illness. There are different reasons for these conflicts, ranging from skirmishes within teams, to insufficient communication, to lack of enforced accountability measures, and indecisive leadership. The direct impact is to those involved in the conflict, while the indirect impact is more widely felt. By embracing a comprehensive conflict consulting framework, organizations can address disputes constructively, enhance communication, improve team collaboration, and create a more productive and harmonious work environment. 
  
 
  
This course is designed for those who would like to consult to organizations to address their internal conflict dynamics. It offers a structured process for engaging clients and partnering with them to effectively address and resolve conflicts within an organization. This course fits in well within the NECR programs’ course offerings, focused on skill building, systems, and for those interested in organizational dynamics. It covers a systemic approach to engaging in addressing organizational conflict by focusing on the client-consultant relationship. It draws on conflict analysis tools and conflict resolution methodologies from within the NECR program and the field, which also works to inform the credibility of the consultant. 
  
 This course is an elective and will meet one weekend, March 28th and 29th, a full Saturday and Sunday, from 9:00-5:00. There will be a pre-work module to lay the foundation for the course, to allow the two days in person, on campus, to be spent engaged in hands-on activities. This course is open to NECR students. Students from other programs with some organizational experience and focus, and some knowledge of conflict resolution, can be permitted to join upon Instructor approval. It is preferred that NECR 6050 and NECR 5101 be completed before taking this course.",Beth Fisher-Yoshida,9:00am,5:00pm,12778,,K5330-20261-001,Special Topics: Consultin,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5330-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

NECR PS5050,STRATEGIC NEGOTIATION IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,"Negotiation today requires navigating complexity, interpreting incomplete data, managing uncertainty, and fostering trust in environments where clarity is scarce and stakes are high. Practitioners must address information gaps and asymmetry, regulatory pressures, and power dynamics while aligning diverse interests and shaping agreements that endure.
  
This course prepares students with skills to negotiate effectively across healthcare, technology, and business—domains where outcomes hinge on data limitations, contractual nuance, and shifting stakeholder priorities. Trust and credibility are emphasized as essential currencies, especially when agreements depend on long-term relationships, compliance, and cross-functional collaboration.
  
Guest speakers from multiple industries will share practical insights into negotiating across roles and power structures. Their perspectives will underscore the value of preparation, trust-building, and adaptive strategies for navigating uncertainty in dynamic environments.
  
Students will:
  
  
Build and apply negotiation frameworks in complex, multiparty environments.
  
Learn how to extract meaning from structured (quantitative) and unstructured (qualitative) data.
  
Develop data-informed narratives to guide decision-making and stakeholder alignment.
  
Practice identifying cognitive bias, ethical tension, and strategic leverage points.
  
Engage in simulations and case studies grounded in real-world contracting and influence challenges.

The course explores how change can create conflict and also how conflict requires change. Conflict is generally about differences in how people think, know, prefer, believe, and understand. By entering into a conflict resolution process, people can shift their understanding and beliefs about the conflict, the other party or parties, and possible outcomes. The course reviews literature and case studies of how people are impacted at a fundamental level when change occurs. Understanding this elemental human experience can lead to greater self-awareness and the ability to manage change professionally and personally, in order to become effective change agents, negotiators, mediators, and peacemakers. We will also explore how leaders at all levels in organizations can play an important role in implementing change in an organizational context. Thoughtful and strategic approaches that consider the impact of a change management process can mitigate and even prevent conflict. We will review change management models and links to developments in neuroscience and how humans are biologically wired to resist change. Balancing theory and practice, this course will focus on the experience and expertise of the students. They will learn to apply practical conflict resolution approaches to change efforts at the individual and organizational levels as well as consider national and international applications.",Susan Levin,12:00pm,2:00pm,12746,,K5095-20261-D01,CONFLICT AND CHANGE MANAG,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5095-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Architecture

NECR PS5210,CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEM,"Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) is a methodology developed in the hard sciences to understand complex systems—from the weather to the functioning of cells, using mathematical algorithms. We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",,9:00am,5:00pm,12766,,K5210-20261-001,CONF RESOLUTION/DYNAMIC S,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5210-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,USSU,20261NECR5210K001,LECTURE
NECR PS5230,Executive Conflict Coaching,"The course offers an in-depth exploration of the foundational principles and skills of conflict coaching. This rigorous curriculum is designed to equip students with the expertise necessary to assist themselves and others in cultivating perspectives, mindsets, and strategies that espouse a constructive and collaborative conflict approach.
  
Inherent to human experience, conflict has outcomes primarily shaped by one's chosen approach. A confrontational stance often results in hampered communication, obstructionism, and a power struggle. Conversely, a collaborative approach accentuates effective communication, amiability, assistance, trust, and coordinated endeavors. This methodology frames conflicting interests not as adversarial positions but as shared challenges necessitating shared resolution. Central to the ethos of this course is the recognition of conflict as a conduit for growth, its potential for constructive engagement, and the imperative for adaptive and visionary leadership embodying executive presence.
  
Conflicts typically evoke a spectrum of emotions in individuals, making them one of the most demanding challenges a coach might assist clients with. Such moments of contention serve as a litmus test for what renowned executive coach John Mattone terms the ""Inner Core"" of an astute leader. Properly navigated, conflicts become avenues for leaders to refine their ""Inner Core"" and bolster their executive maturity.
  
This course is specifically designed for graduate students who aim to expand their expertise in navigating and mediating conflicts within the workplace.

NECR PS6050,CAPSTONE: Conflict Analysis Models,"Conflict analysis is central to understanding the context and content of any conflict. It is also critical for the person doing the conflict analysis to have a good understanding of who they are as a conflict resolution practitioner, including the frames with which they view the conflict analysis. Our worldviews, assumptions, values, and beliefs shape how we frame and create meaning from conflicts that we choose to examine, and how we understand the dynamics of those conflicts. Therefore, to conduct an impartial analysis of any conflict, and add value for the stakeholders involved, self-awareness is crucial.
  
This course is the foundation for developing the necessary mindset for conflict analysis. We want you to be able to enter any situation and ask the question, “What is really going on here?” and to use that inquiry to uncover underlying needs, issues, and assumptions. In this course, in addition to increasing your self-awareness as a conflict resolution practitioner, you will explore and become familiar with diverse conflict analysis approaches and tools, beginning with creating a conflict map to identify the actors, dynamics, and structures that are creating, escalating, and perpetuating the conflict. You will work with a variety of conflict analysis tools to examine the stakeholder perspectives and will be asked to identify issues that surfaced as a result of this analysis. You will define goals for your inquiry that correspond to the conflict issues you have identified and coalesce thematically around a specific purpose of appropriate scope for your capstone study. You will utilize the Coordinated Management of Meaning and Case Study frameworks to engage in desk-based qualitative inquiry using secondary sources. You will put theory into practice by interpreting the secondary data through the lens of applicable theory. The data will be further analyzed using CMM models and conflict analysis tools as a means of surfacing several needs to be addressed in your intervention design (in the next capstone course).
  
This course is the first of three (3) required courses of the capstone sequence.
 In 6050, students will complete conflict analysis for their capstone case study.
 In 6250, students will design an intervention that addresses the needs identified in their earlier analysis. In 6350, students will consider sustainability, as well as monitoring and evaluation strategies for their proposed intervention.",Courtney A Chicvak,10:00am,4:00pm,12782,,K6050-20261-D01,CAPSTONE: Conflict Analys,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K6050-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,S,20261NECR6050KD01,SEMINAR

NOPM PS5160,COMMUNICATIONS & MARKETING FOR NONPROFIT,"This introductory core course examines the central role of marketing and communications in fulfilling the mission of nonprofit institutions of all types and at all stages of development. The programmatic objective of this course is to build a shared set of competencies and understandings around the power, practices, ethical applications, and desired outcomes of nonprofit marketing and communications.
  
Dramatic changes across civil society in recent years, including the evolving role of nonprofits in democratic discourse and the rise of new forms of communications technologies, means that nonprofit leaders today must have a fundamental understanding of the principles of marketing and communications in order to ensure organizational success both internally and externally. While outreach technologies and trends change rapidly in our era, true excellence in the field is based upon a core group of basic skills that are hardly novel: strong writing and analysis, strategic planning, and the ability to connect disparate individuals across a wide range of disciplines and diverse backgrounds to build an inclusive community around shared goals.
  
This course is designed to help students gain these skills through engaging with the strategic frameworks and tactical applications needed to create and leverage a range of communications and marketing activities. The course will introduce students to multiple communications and marketing practices designed to engage key stakeholders, including donors, the media, volunteers and advocates, and additional internal and external influencers and sector leaders. Throughout the semester, the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all forms of outreach (written and oral; digital and print) will be foregrounded.

 provide a voyeuristic opportunity for us to look under the hood of the behaving adolescent brain. This
 course will cover empirical and theoretical accounts of adolescent-specific changes in brain and behavior
 that relate to the development of self control. These accounts of adolescent brain and behavior will then
 be discussed in the context of relevant legal, social and health policy issues. Lectures and discussion will
 address: Under what circumstances self control appears to be diminished in adolescents. How do
 dynamic changes in neural circuitry help to explain changes in self control across development? When
 does the capacity for self control fully mature? Are these changes observed in other species? How might

Without the barn owl we would not fully understand how the brain detects interaural time differences and localizes sounds. Without echolocating bats our knowledge of three-dimensional navigation and memory would be diminished. Through the study of animal systems that are specialized for particular sensory and motor acts, scientists have been able to dissect the circuit computations underlying key behaviors, such as decision making, prey detection, foraging, mate selection, and communication, that are fundamental across species. Through short introductory talks and in-depth discussions of primary scientific literature, this course will provide a foundation for understanding these behaviors, and relate discoveries in animal research to broader themes in neurobiology, ecology, and medicine.",Abigail N Zadina,11:00am,12:50pm,00040,,X3385-20261-001,,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3385-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261NSBV3385X001,SEMINAR

PEPM IA8250,Financial Development,"Open to all SIPA with pre-req or concurrent-req: Macroeconomics. 
This course aims to provide a well-rounded understanding of financial development over time and across countries, with an emphasis on public policy. Topics include a review of the foundations and processes of financial development; the roles of markets, instruments, and institutions; issues related to systemic financial stability; links to financial repression and globalization; and the developmental and oversight roles of the state. Financial activities arise in response to the interplay of a few easily identifiable frictions and related market failures, operating within an evolving institutional environment and uncertain macroeconomic context. Finance has both a bright side (welfare-enhancing financial development) and a dark side (financial instability and potential excess finance).
  
This conceptualization of financial development is supported by a review of the fundamental foundations of finance through simple modeling exercises, statistical illustrations of financial trends, and references to specific country experiences, many drawn from the work of IMF or World Bank financial sector-related missions.

The Seminar is restricted to Columbia graduate students in their third or later years, and all such students are strongly encouraged to attend. No faculty (other than the organizer) will be present. Those attending the seminar will be expected to make one or more presentations of work in progress. The material for a presentation may range from a near-final draft of a chapter, to an early critical overview of an area with an outline plan for an approach to some chosen problem. We will attempt as far as possible to organize the presentations in such a way that they are grouped by subject-matter, and provide a rational path through the territory we cover.",Christopher Peacocke,10:10am,12:00pm,13814,,G9990-20261-001,,Philosophy,PHIL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHIL/G9990-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,F,20261PHIL9990G001,SEMINAR

PHIL UN2109,"Love, Gender, and Sex","What does it mean to love, and what does it take to love well? Must true love make us “happy ever after”? Should love be exclusive? Is love between individuals or could it be communal and even political? How does love relate to gender and sex, and how might the experiences of queer, trans, and intersex people both complicate and illuminate these connections? What is gender anyway? How do we figure that out? Is it a mere coincidence that the English term ‘sex’ refers to both an activity and a system of categorization? How should we think about consent, desire, objectification, and sexualization in connection to sexual autonomy and gender equality? This course surveys philosophical questions about love, gender, and sex, and in so doing, aims to introduce students to the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of social philosophy.

The course combines lectures, tutorials, and two lab sections. In one lab section, students will do experiments with entangled photons. In the second lab section, students will program quantum computers and run algorithms on them using the IBM Qiskit platform.
  
The course starts with a recap of linear algebra and quantum mechanics, followed by an introduction to quantum optics and quantum information. Two-level systems, Bloch sphere, quantum gates, and elementary quantum algorithms will be discussed. Quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution will be introduced as applications of entanglement. The lecture content will be directly applied in experiments with entangled photons. In the following, state-of-the-art quantum algorithms will be discussed, related to cutting-edge research results in quantum computing. This includes quantum Fourier transform, quantum simulation of the Schroedinger equation, and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. During the course students will do one experimental project with entangled photons and one quantum programming project.

PHYS UN3084,Quantum Simulation and Computing Lab,"The “Quantum Simulation and Computing Lab” will give students hands-on experience in quantum optics, quantum simulation and quantum computing. The course combines lectures, tutorials, and two lab sections. In one lab section, students will do experiments with entangled photons. In the second lab section, students will program quantum computers and run algorithms on them using the IBM Qiskit platform.
  
The course starts with a recap of linear algebra and quantum mechanics, followed by an introduction to quantum optics and quantum information. Two-level systems, Bloch sphere, quantum gates, and elementary quantum algorithms will be discussed. Quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution will be introduced as applications of entanglement. The lecture content will be directly applied in experiments with entangled photons. In the following, state-of-the-art quantum algorithms will be discussed, related to cutting-edge research results in quantum computing. This includes quantum Fourier transform, quantum simulation of the Schroedinger equation, and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. During the course students will do one experimental project with entangled photons and one quantum programming project. Students will be guided to implement a quantum algorithm of their choice and run it on a quantum computer (IBM, IonQ, QuEra).",,,,13935,,W3084-20261-001,Quantum Simul. & Computin,Physics,PHYS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHYS/W3084-20261-001/,,In-Person,"Barnard College

PMGT K5100,Leadership and Team Dynamics,"This course introduces students to the core principles of effective leadership and collaborative team performance in organizational settings. Through a practical, evidence-based approach, the course examines how leaders influence outcomes, foster engagement, and navigate challenges in dynamic, multidisciplinary environments. Students will explore leadership qualifications, strategic decision-making, ethical considerations, and performance development frameworks. Emphasis is placed on understanding the dynamics of team formation, multicultural collaboration, communication, conflict management, and high-performance team practices.
  
As a central component of the Project Management curriculum, this course supports the program’s larger goal of preparing graduates to lead effectively in diverse and evolving organizational contexts. By grounding students in evidence-based leadership concepts and team effectiveness frameworks, the course advances the discipline’s primary principles of organizational performance, collaboration, and responsible decision-making. The course aligns closely with other program requirements by complementing technical project management competencies with the interpersonal and strategic skills necessary for successful project execution. In doing so, it bridges technical expertise with leadership acumen, equipping students with a holistic foundation for professional growth.
  
This is a required core course for all Project Management students and is delivered in person on campus in a full-semester format. Space permitting, the course may also be open to cross-registrants from other Columbia University graduate programs where leadership, management, and teamwork skills are relevant, such as programs in management, public administration, and engineering. There are no formal prerequisites, though prior exposure to management or organizational behavior may be helpful in engaging with course materials. Students will participate in selected readings, interactive discussions, and team-based exercises, as well as hear from guest lecturers with extensive leadership experience. By the end of the course, students will have strengthened their ability to lead ethically, communicate clearly, manage team dynamics, and contribute meaningfully to organizational goals.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,12978,,K5100-20261-001,Leadership and Team Dynam,Project Management,PMGT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PMGT/K5100-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20261PMGT5100K001,LECTURE
POAN PS5020,Strategic Thinking,"Politics involves a complex interaction of competing interests.  For practitioners, it is crucial to understand how efforts are met with responses, and predicting those responses is critical to designing successful strategies.  Game theory is the formal mathematical analysis of strategic interaction across the social sciences.  This course provides a general theoretical language to the theory of games, examining the intentional thought process of rational actors in strategic environments.  Students will acquire tools for understanding the dynamics that lead to the success of a political campaign or policy-making effort.  Course topics include two-person games, dynamic games, bargaining, and signaling. Students will also examine a variety of cases.",Michael Ting,6:10pm,8:00pm,12688,,K5020-20261-001,,Political Analytics,POAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5020-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,2,,R,20261POAN5020K001,LECTURE
POAN PS5040,Survey & Polling Methodology,"Survey research has played a pivotal role in politics for the better part of the last century, with a wide range of campaign and public policy professionals conducting surveys to gain insight into the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of the electorate and citizenry as a whole. Since the early 2000s, the use of survey experiments has become exponentially more prevalent in the political realm as a way to assess attitudes, anticipate reactions, or measure causal relationships. Recent trends point to the growing importance of the internet and social media to conduct surveys and the linkage of survey data with the wealth of publicly available personal information as well as with information on individuals’ social and economic behavior. In this course, students will learn about the strengths and weaknesses of survey research as well as limitations associated with survey design and various analytical techniques, and they will acquire concrete knowledge of practical tools used in campaigns, advocacy, and election forecasting. Students will be introduced to a set of principles for conducting survey research and analyzing survey data that are the basis for standard practice in the field. Students will be familiarized with terminology and concepts associated with survey questionnaire design, sampling, data collection and aggregation, and survey data analysis to gain insights and to test hypotheses about the nature of human and social behavior and interaction. The course will present a framework that will enable students to evaluate the influence of different sources of error on the quality of data.",Kelly T Rader,6:10pm,8:00pm,12689,,K5040-20261-D01,Survey & Polling Methodol,Political Analytics,POAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5040-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,2,,M,20261POAN5040KD01,LECTURE

The aims that leaders seek to achieve are determined by their ability to create value, collaborate, influence, navigate uncertainty, and advance ideas, programs, and movements. In this course, students will learn about how the development of personal attributes and abilities lays the groundwork for building the core leadership competencies that are essential for high-impact management as well as changing the behavior and the culture of organizations with particular emphasis on how to successfully introduce the methods and results of analytics. Students will explore the motivations, obstacles, and interventions of change, and learn to build alliances, facilitate difficult meetings and develop a transformation plan. They will also review some of the most important academic research and business publications on change management and the implementation of analytics. The course is intended to enhance practical skills through dynamic interactions with the instructor, role-playing with classmates, and other real-world experiences.",David Wolfson,6:10pm,8:00pm,12690,,K5060-20261-D01,,Political Analytics,POAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5060-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,2,,M,20261POAN5060KD01,LECTURE
POAN PS5120,Electoral Data & Predictive Modeling,"One of the best ways to predict the future is to study the past. A dizzying amount of data is available to study elections and politics, including survey and polling data on individual preferences, beliefs, demographics, and choices; data on aggregate conditions and outcomes; and, for more recent years, a wide range of social media data. From polling analysts and pundits to campaign managers and career journalists, making sense of this data can create a competitive advantage for professionals working in the field of politics. By analyzing the results of previous elections, insights can be gleaned to enhance understanding of the factors that contributed to electoral wins and be used to build statistical models or to create machine learning models that can predict future outcomes. Students will curate various types of data and work with starter code to build their data wrangling and computational skills. Students will learn how to explore data with these techniques, understand how they work, and derive insights and knowledge based on the analysis results.",Michael Schwam-Baird,6:10pm,8:00pm,12691,,K5120-20261-001,Electoral Data & Predict,Political Analytics,POAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5120-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20261POAN5120K001,LECTURE
POAN PS5130,Big Data & Political Strategy,"Some experts on U.S. political campaigns have argued that big data has fundamentally changed the way politicians win elections and pursue policymaking. With the combination of massive amounts of personal data and information about individual voters and society at large, readily available processing power, sophisticated machine learning techniques, and cheap and efficient communication methods, modern political professionals are able to identify likely supporters, understand their issues of interest and concern, make direct appeals with micro-targeted messages, and mobilize these constituencies to donate, volunteer, turnout, mobilize, and vote accordingly. Without a doubt, big data has the potential to inform strategic decision-making across multiple aspects of politics.
  
In this course, students will learn about the range of big data sources that can be gathered and aggregated, including public data, voter file data, consumer data, and more. Students will become familiar with the ways in which data can be used to gain insights about voters’ sentiments, attitudes, and opinions and to develop strategies to predict and prompt behavior.  Most importantly, students will learn to synthesize a variety of data sources into a cohesive strategy and presentation that can be given to decision-makers, whether for electoral or advocacy purposes.",Benjamin Messner,2:10pm,4:00pm,10364,,K5130-20261-001,Big Data & Political Stra,Political Analytics,POAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5130-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20261POAN5130K001,LECTURE

POLS BC1110,POLITICAL THEORY I,"This course considers key questions at the foundation of political thought.  What is justice?  How do we justify the coercive power of states? Do we have an obligation to obey the government? Who should make and enforce the law?  What basic rights and liberties should governments protect? How should our economic system produce and divide wealth and material resources?  What are the claims of excluded or marginalized groups and how can these claims be addressed?   We explore these questions through the works of several classical and contemporary political thinkers.  A major goal of the course is to practice the skills needed to understand a political thinker’s arguments and to construct one’s own.

The course is organized around four questions. First, why can only some people depend upon the state to enforce order? Second, how can we account for the differences between autocracies and democracies? Third, what different institutional forms does democratic government take? Finally, are some institutions more likely than others to produce desirable social outcomes such as accountability, redistribution, and political stability?

How do borders relate to political membership and rights? What can borders teach us about modern sovereign power? Are there any limits to state coercion and violence in border enforcement? In what ways do borders manifest racial hierarchies and divides within the global order? How do we rethink political responsibility in response to problems of rightlessness generated by borders? In addressing these questions, the course prioritizes borders as crucial sites for understanding and interrogating key political concepts such as sovereignty, membership, rights, and violence.",Ayten Gundogdu,10:10am,11:25am,00939,,X3003-20261-001,POLITICAL THEORY AT THE B,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3003-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20261POLS3003X001,LECTURE

This course emphasizes the way that Black activists, scholars, and/or artists have responded to eternal questions in political thought about freedom, oppression, resistance, citizenship, democracy, etc., from the standpoint of Blackness in the United States. Moreover, the course is not just African-American Political Thought, it is also American Political Thought, insofar as Black theorizations and experiences of America provides a vital framework for interrogating the American experiment, citizenship and non-citizenship, American slavery and its afterlives, inclusion and exclusion, liberation and domination, and ultimately what “America” is and what it does (and perhaps could) mean to be American.",Jonathan J Keller,1:10pm,2:25pm,00950,,X3021-20261-001,AFRICAN AMERICAN POL THOU,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3021-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261POLS3021X001,LECTURE

This course examines how thinkers of contrasting perspectives have understood capitalism politically. Some have celebrated the market as an escape from coercion, while others criticize it as a source of disguised domination; some see capitalism as leveling social hierarchies, while others point to its creation of class and racial hierarchy; some see capitalism as an engine of wealth creation and heightened living standards, while others emphasize its destruction of existing ways of life and production of inequality; some see capitalism as an engine of peace, while others emphasize its reliance on violence. In particular, we will consider the relationship between state and market, moral critiques of markets and exchange, analyses of the role of force and violence in accumulation, and theories of freedom and domination.",Alyssa Battistoni,11:00am,12:50pm,00491,,X3048-20261-001,COLL: CAPITALISM & ITS CR,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3048-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261POLS3048X001,COLLOQUIA

We will examine a variety of explanations for such violence, including rationalist, psychological/emotion-based, and organizational approaches. We will also discuss the impact of political violence. Does it get the job done, so to speak? Does violence move terrorist groups closer to their goals? Does indiscriminate violence by the state spur rebellion or suppress insurgencies? Does insurgent violence against civilians make insurgencies more or less effective? While we emphasize violence intentionally causing harm to civilians we will also consider collateral damage.
  
 
  
In addition to our discussions of this literature we will explore what light selected empirical evidence might shed on our questions. You will each select a theoretical problem of interest—e.g., two competing theories, a theory that might be revised or applied in a new context—and write a paper addressing this problem on the basis of empirical research (either through qualitative case studies or quantitative analysis).

To what extent and under what circumstances do elected officials consider public preferences in making policy? To what extent and under what circumstances might we want them to? What kind of power should the public have in American democracy? Thinking about the second and third, more normative questions leads us to other empirical questions. What shapes public preferences? How well can we measure them? How much do people know and care about politics? How do they evaluate their representatives? What constitutes high quality representation? We will examine these kinds of questions broadly, and also consider how they play out in particular policy areas and historical moments. We will also discuss the dynamics of public opinion across population subgroups (e.g. by race, sex, income, party, urbanity, etc.), and questions surrounding representation at the group level. In addition to engaging scholarly literature on public opinion and representation, students will also learn to access, manage, and analyze data measuring the composition of the public (e.g. the U.S. Census) as well as public views on political candidates, officeholders, institutions, and issues (e.g. survey data). These skills will help to prepare students for research projects in other courses and beyond Barnard.

POLS BC3350,COLL: THE PROMISES AND PERILS OF IDENTIT,"In the course, we will engage the decades-long debates around what it means to organize politics around identity in the United States, particularly from the lens of marginalized groups. In the age of American politics where the term “identity politics” is often used as a dismissal or derogation of the experiences of marginalized groups, what exactly is identity politics? What do the contemporary anxieties around identity politics tell us about political life? What are the political possibilities that arise from organizing identity-based movements? Does focusing too much on identity politics overshadow concerns around material redistribution? We will trace the notion of identity politics back to its origins in Black queer feminism in the 1970s, and seek to understand its evolutions to today. We will bridge the work of critical theorists with the empirical study of identity-based politics, focusing on those who have sought to negotiate differences across race, gender, and sexuality.",Sonya G Chen,2:10pm,4:00pm,00946,,X3350-20261-001,COLL: PROMISES&PERILS ID,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3350-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261POLS3350X001,COLLOQUIA
POLS BC3407,DEMOCRACY'S GUARDRAILS?,"The speed and smoothness of democratic backsliding and the suddenness of democratic breakdowns tend to surprise us. We expect established institutions and parties, as well as the individuals socialized in democratic norms who populate them, to remain loyal to democracy. But instead we often see both hard and soft guardrails of democracy (institutions and norms) crumble, as various combinations of judges, capitalists, party activists, bureaucrats, military officers, and law-enforcement personnel accept and even support the actions of aspiring authoritarians. In this course we will explore why and when this happens—and also look at conditions that might prevent this from happening.
  
 
  
Our focus will be specific—not on the would-be dictators or on structural forces that might shape these processes but on those institutions and actors that might be considered the bystanders or enablers of democratic reversals. Our readings will include political science literature on democratic breakdowns and fracturing of elite consensus, political norms, and strategic games of transition, but we will also read selections of relevant histories and memoirs. We will consider cases of breakdown and backsliding from 1930s Germany to 1970s Chile to twenty-first-century Hungary, Poland, and the United States—always focusing on potential guardrails.",Marjorie Castle,4:10pm,5:25pm,00947,,X3407-20261-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3407-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261POLS3407X001,LECTURE

POLS BC3801,COLL:POLITICS OF DEVELOPMENT,"Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent Description: The semester-long course aims to study political and social factors behind economic development and exam empirical cases of the success and failure in economic growth in order to understand the key features of the development processes. In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3.

POLS GR8210,COLLOQ ON POLITICAL BEHAVIOR,"Courses on public opinion and political behavior (including the GR8210 seminar taught by Professor Shapiro) ordinarily move briskly through a wide array of topics having to do with how American tend to think and act. This class has a narrower scope but tries to delve more deeply into the literature.  We focus on four topics that are arguably crucial understanding contemporary American politics (and perhaps the politics of other times and places). 
  
  
The first topic addresses what might be thought of as the legacies of slavery: prejudice, resentment, racial/ethnic group identification, issue preferences on topics that are directly or indirectly connected to race/ethnicity, and group differences in political behavior. 
  
The second topic considers the literature on partisanship and polarization, as well as related topics on “macropartisan” change and party realignment.  What are the causes of micro- and macropartisan change, and what are its consequences? 
  
The third topic is support for democratic norms, civil liberties, and respect for the rights of unpopular groups.  How deeply committed are Americans to democratic values and constitutional rights?  
  
The fourth topic is the influence of media on public opinion, a vast topic that includes the effects of advertising, news, social media, narrative entertainment, and so forth. 
 
  
Although we will be focusing on just four broad topics, time constraints nevertheless prevent us from covering more than a fraction of each scholarly literature.  Students are encouraged to read beyond the syllabus, and I am happy to offer suggestions.",Robert Y Shapiro,2:10pm,4:00pm,12617,,G8210-20261-001,COLLOQ ON POLITICAL BEHAV,Political Science,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/G8210-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,GR8210,R,20261POLS8210G001,COLLOQUIA

Students will rigorously examine contemporary debates, both theoretically and empirically. Student will also combine formal models and modern research designs to generate hypotheses, identify causal effects, and ultimately seek to interpret them. The course draws from evidence from across the democratic world. The goals of this course are twofold. The substantive goal is to familiarize students with theoretical arguments and frontier empirical evidence pertaining to central questions in comparative political economy. The methodological goal is to help students think critically and conduct cutting edge research. Specifically, the course aims to empower students to read and even write formal models, implement modern causal inference techniques in their research, and combine the two approaches to interpret the evidence.",John Marshall,10:10am,12:00pm,12619,,G8422-20261-001,POL ECON ANALYS OF POL BE,Political Science,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/G8422-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20261POLS8422G001,COLLOQUIA

We examine the leading theories, their key concepts and causal variables, the causal paths leading to war or to peace, and the conditions under which various outcomes are most likely to occur. We also give some attention to the degree of empirical support for various theories and hypotheses, and we look at some of the major empirical research programs on the origins and expansion of war. Our survey includes research utilizing qualitative methods, large-N quantitative methods, formal modeling, and experimental approaches. We also give considerable attention to methodological questions relating to epistemology and research design. Our primary focus, however, is on the logical coherence and analytic limitations of the theories and the kinds of research designs that might be useful in testing them. This course is designed primarily for graduate students who want to understand and contribute to the theoretical and empirical literature in political science on war, peace, and security.

While studying firms allows for the generation of new insights across a broad array of substantive topics, it carries with it several unique conceptual and empirical challenges. For example, how should we conceive of firms as political actors, given their organizational structures? What are firms’ policy preferences? How do they influence politics, and how can we measure their impact? In this course we will review political economy research that centers the firm as the actor of interest; particular focus will be given to recently published work that is innovative in terms of methodology, measurement, and/or data collection. While we will focus primarily on international political economy applications—for example, firm-level studies of trade, in-vestment, and commercial diplomacy—we will also cover less inherently international topics such as lobbying, environmental politics, and private governance/corporate social responsi-bility.

POLS UN2601,International Politics,"Why do countries go to war? What conditions foster international cooperation? How do alliances between countries function? How are countries affected by global trade and investment, and in turn how does the political economy of individual countries shape international conflict and cooperation? How do ideas and culture (including both positive ideas like human rights and negative ideas like racism) affect international politics? What role do individuals and groups play in shaping international politics? What explains the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why isn’t there significant cooperation on climate change, and can a new global cooperation emerge? What issues have garnered international attention, and how has that shaped the countries’ cooperation? What causes terrorism? Is the proliferation of nuclear (or cyber) weapons a threat to peace, and if so, how should the world response? Does UN peacekeeping work?
  
In this course we will begin to grapple with these questions. We will use theories developed by philosophers, political scientists and policy analysts, and we will examine the historical roots of today’s problems, in order to explain and predict the patterns of international politics and the possibilities for change. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to choose and develop their own theories to explain events.
  
Learning Objectives:
  
By the end of the semester, students will accomplish the following:
  
  
Demonstrate broad factual and causal knowledge of important current and historical issues in international relations.
  
Apply contending theories from the political science literature and the policy world to analyze, compare, and evaluate events and trends in international relations.
  
Assess the value of competing theories in explaining events.
  
Synthesize facts and arguments across cases in order to reason critically and argue creatively, through both oral discussions in section and written essays.",Jayme R Schlesinger,10:10am,11:25am,12570,,W2601-20261-001,,Political Science,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W2601-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261POLS2601W001,LECTURE

POLS UN3104,WHAT WAS NAZISM?,"How did political theory explain the rise of Nazism in Germany? What models did it develop to understand the structure of the Nazi state, politics and the economy? What can we learn from this for dealing with the crises of democracy and the emergence of authoritarian politics today? This course in political theory and the history of political thought will explore contemporary answers to these questions. It will explore the thought of crucial thinkers on the problems and pitfalls of modern parliamentary democracy such as Max Weber and Hans Kelsen, as well as some of the most influential theoretical voices associated with ideas of Fascism, Totalitarianism and Anti-Semitism such as Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Ernst Fraenkel and Hannah Arendt. 
  
 The course will be structured around texts mainly from the 1920s to the 1960s which still have relevance for political theory today. A strong emphasis will be laid on originally German thinkers who fled to the US in the time of Nazi rule and who contributed decisively to American political science and its particular outlook in the post-war era.  
  
 This course aims to contextualise the discussed texts within the intellectual world of their own time. Students with an interest in twentieth century political, intellectual and social history will, therefore, be particularly welcome. However, the questions raised in the set texts also demand a theoretical and creative engagement with questions of good democratic rule, the challenges of mass society and participation, political in- and exclusion, minority rights and the emergence of terror and authoritarian rule. Additionally there will be a midterm and a final exam which will examine both students’ understanding of the set texts as well as their own thinking on the political theoretical problems raised in this course.",Clara Maier,,,12572,,W3104-20261-001,,Political Science,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3104-20261-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20261POLS3104W001,LECTURE
POLS UN3106,"Democracy: Principles, Critics and Probl","This course is about democracy: its theory, principles, critics and challenges. After centuries of vilification, democracy acquired the status of the ""best"" political order thanks also to the defeat of Nazism and fascism, in 1945. The end of the Cold War and the international order created by the victors of World War II caused some major changes in the perception and practice of democracy. The world has become a unified place for financial markets and a borderless space for the implementation of hegemonic projects. Openness and globalization put pressure on the ideal and practice of democracy, however. On the one hand, democracy seems to be the solution to all problems so much so that ""democracy"" now means everything on the right side of history. On the other hand, it seems instead to be a source of problems, and many (even democrats) criticize it for being inefficient in decision-making, subject to the prejudices of increasingly uninformed and ignorant voters, and finally a system that breeds corruption. The goal of this course is to understand this conundrum. 
  
What are the basic principles of democracy and the main objections raised against it? In what sense does democracy embody universal values? Is it desirable that democracy contains partisanship with competence? Is populism a fate of modern democracies? These questions will guide us in understanding the promises of democracy and the disappointments of democrats. We will begin our intellectual journey with the ancient vision of democracy and its early critics, then explore the modern trajectory of democratic theory and finally contemporary populist transformations.",,2:40pm,3:55pm,12573,,W3106-20261-001,"Demcrcy: Prncpls, Crit, P",Political Science,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3106-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261POLS3106W001,LECTURE

POLS UN3565,DRUGS & POLITICS IN AMERICAS,"A major challenge for governments across the Western Hemisphere is the complex relationship between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods to the global arenas where governments debate and craft international drug policy. These links also reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule, race relations during and following the collapse of the institution of slavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States. Throughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues to broader theories, concepts and empirical findings in political science. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted below with the headings A – G) under three overarching themes for this semester:
  
 
  
1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: 
The first theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of illicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions we will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit?  How did domestic and global politics come together to shape the global drug regime and the “war on drugs?” What role did race and gender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs?
  
 
  
2. Illicit Drugs, Politics and Governance:
 The second theme focuses on contemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. Here we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets are either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions like: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the relationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role do illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors?  Are states and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at “war” with each other?

How should we think about firms as political actors? Why, when, and how do firms attempt to influence policymaking? And when do they succeed? In this course, we will study strategic collaboration, competition, and collusion between firms and governments in a range of settings and policy areas. To do so, we will draw on insights from international relations, economics, and business scholars, and we will frequently engage with current real-world examples of business-government relations.

PSYC BC2144,The Dog,"Who's a good dog? The history of the species (a member of which might be napping on your bed right now) is intertwined with human history since the late Pleistocene. In this lecture course we turn our gaze to the animal who is famous for their gaze toward and interest in us: the domestic dog, 
Canis familiaris
.
  
Dogs are not just good bed-warmers and companions: they are also an excellent introduction into how behavioral science is conducted; an example of the rapid effect of genetic changes; and a case study in how science influences animals' social and legal roles in society. We will look at the history of the development of the species and the recent further development into hundreds of types of purebred dogs. As a domesticated species, dogs are an example of the effect of artificial selection on appearance and behavior. We will discuss the genetic markers underpinning those effects. Dogs also have had a long role in psychological science, and their history, from Pavlov's experiments to present day, traces the history of behaviorism and the cognitive revolution in the field. We will consider the perceptual world of dogs and the importance of understanding sensory capacity in study design. We will spend several weeks on highlights from recent cognitive studies of dogs demonstrating dogs' surprising capacities in areas previously thought to be solely humans' province. Working from video examples, we will learn to describe behaviors objectively, and will discuss how to develop testable hypotheses of the function of seen behavior. We will conclude the semester with a consideration of the future of dogs in science and in our lives.",Alexandra C Horowitz,10:10am,11:25am,00658,,X2144-20261-001,,Psychology @Barnard,PSYC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/X2144-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261PSYC2144X001,LECTURE

The aim of this course is to critically examine the complex interaction of biological, psychological and environmental factors which impact the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of substance abuse and dependence. The course focuses on those drugs which have abuse and dependence potential with specific emphasis on Alcohol and the Depressants, the Psychostimulants, and the Opiates.  A primary objective is to provide insight into factors which contribute to challenges with substances for some individuals and to better understand their felt and lived experience with drugs.
  
The course begins with a review of theoretical perspectives including disease, behavioral, cognitive, social learning, psychodynamic, and neurobiological models.  The physical, psychological, and socio-cultural effects/impact of each major class of drug will then follow. Within each category, we will also discuss controversial issues related to each drug for example: methadone maintenance, needle exchange programs, Ritalin/Adderall abuse, the “opiate epidemic.”  Throughout the course, case histories, film documentaries and memoirs will provide personal accounts of the drug experience.  We conclude the course with an overview of treatment interventions.",E'Mett McCaskill,1:10pm,2:25pm,00299,,X2177-20261-001,PSYCHOLOGY OF DRUG USE &ABUSE,Psychology @Barnard,PSYC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/X2177-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,BC1001,TR,20261PSYC2177X001,LECTURE

PSYC GU4486,Emotional Brain Development,There is nothing more important to us than the feelings that we have. But where do our emotions come from and why do we sometimes feel differently from our peers? The reason usually involves an understanding of one’s developmental history.  This course uses a developmental approach to address emotional brain-behavior relationships.  We will discuss theoretical papers and empirical work that covers typical and atypical behavior and the neurobiology that supports behavioral change across age. A translational approach is taken that uses animal models and human examples to illustrate these developmental trajectories. We will cover experimental approaches during discussion of each topic.,Nim L Tottenham,2:10pm,4:00pm,12090,,G4486-20261-001,Emotional Brain Developme,Psychology,PSYC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/G4486-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

PUBH GU4100,(Y)OUR LONGER LIFE,"People are living 30 years longer than we did 100 years ago. We have created a whole new stage of life. How do we prepare to benefit from our longer lives? What can you do in your own life? This course explores the personal, population, community, and societal dimensions of our now-longer lives, of aging itself, and the role of health and societal design in the experience of aging. The course examines the meaning of aging and the attendant expectations, myths, fears, and realities. The course examines an aging society as a public health success, the potential for building health futures, the health plan you want to be healthy in old age, and the potential for longer lives and how we unlock it. It addresses the roles public health currently plays and can play in shaping a society for an aging population. The course explores how a public health system—indeed, a society—optimized for an aging population stands to benefit all. The course also examines the physical, cognitive, and psychological aspects of aging, the exposures across our lives that affect these, the attributes and challenges of aging, keys to successful aging, and aging around the globe. The culminating project will design elements of our society that are needed to support the opportunity of having longer lives. This course comprises lectures, class discussions, individual assignments, in-class case activities, and a group project in which students shall take an active role. You will be responsible for regular preparatory assignments, writing assignments, one group project, and attending course sessions.

PUBH UN3100,FUNDAMENTALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH,"Many of the greatest challenges in public health are global. This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to discuss the major underlying determinants of poor health and the relationship between health and political, social and economic development. Drawing upon the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, students will be introduced to the evolution of modern approaches to the setting of global health priorities, the functions and roles of health systems, an overview of current global health practices, and the major institutional players in global health. The first unit of the class will focus on establishing the foundations for a public health approach to understanding the challenges of global health. This will involve exploration of the factors shaping the global distribution of disease and their connection with issues of social, economic, and political development, as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals. The second unit will explore in further detail a number of major health priorities. A significant goal of the class will be to identify common sources of vulnerability and challenge across health risks, and the consequent need for a systemic approach to their being addressed. The third and final unit builds upon this analysis to demonstrate the multi-disciplinary, multi-level approach required to effectively address global health priorities, and the political and organizational cooperation required to achieve this. The class concludes with an analysis of the major challenges and threats to global coordination regarding such threats as pandemic influenza and emerging health threats related to climate change.

It also reveals a broader trend: in the early 1990s, it seemed that Western liberal values were triumphant worldwide. However, as Russia failed to transition into a democratic state, anti-Americanism and revanchism began to flourish. After becoming president, Vladimir Putin exploited these sentiments, ultimately making anti-Americanism a central aspect of his international political agenda. Russian propaganda has not only influenced the Russian population but also seeks to spread these ideas and conspiracy theories beyond Russia’s borders. As an inherently unstable political system, Russia aims to destabilize the West.

RELI BC3096,"More than Real: Dreams, Imagination, and","This course is thematic, though a loose history of dreaming, imaginative praxis, and virtual reality environments across South Asia will emerge through the networked conversations across texts. The advantage of a thematic course allows us to cover various genres such as: ritual manuals; epic; poetry; philosophical argument; biographical accounts; prophecies; conversion stories; and medical textbooks to name a handful. At the end of the course, we will see how the texts encountered in the first part have been repurposed to speak to social justice movements around caste - both within South Asia and the diaspora population in the U.S. The thematic of dreaming and imagination also provides flexibility in method: because students will have the opportunity to study conversations between different historical actors across religious traditions about dreams, they will also have the opportunity to revise problematic accounts of religious pluralism and communalism in South Asia. Students will read primary texts from Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Sikh traditions to name a handful. Students can look forward to reading about worlds within rocks; falling asleep and waking up as another person only to die in the dream world, wake up and then realize your dream-life family is somehow real and looking for you; how to finally interpret those pesky dreams about teeth falling out; dismembered bodies generating the universe; daydreaming about a cloud that thinks mountain peaks look like nipples; how to build a mind-temple that Shiva prefers to the physical one with fancy rock; and much more!",Meghan E Hartman,10:10am,12:00pm,00206,,X3096-20261-001,More Than Real,Religion @Barnard,RELI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X3096-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20261RELI3096X001,SEMINAR

And then there is of course the Great Mother, the matriarchal origins of the divine, as well as the contested matriarchy at the origins of human society.

From narratives of religion’s predicted decline during the twentieth century to its much-discussed global resurgence at the turn of the twenty-first, the concept of public religion continues to occupy popular imagination. Through the lens of public religion, we are able to examine pressing issues such as the revitalization of, or disillusionment toward, institutional forms and political establishments in our questionably secular age. What happens when religion “goes public”? Correspondingly, what assumptions about the category of religion and its role in public places do discussions of public religion promote?  Over the course of the semester, we will investigate the possibilities, pitfalls, and practicalities of understanding religion in terms of public life.

Students in the seminar will explore a range of materials that 1) guide Buddhist practitioners to cultivate certain types of dreams, and 2) narrate dream experiences that the dreamer has deemed worth recording, and 3) situate Tibetan Buddhist examples in broader contexts of religious and psychological perspectives, with an emphasis on Freud and Jung’s treatment of dreams. According to Buddhist sources, a dream might be significant because the dreamer understands it to be revelatory, foretelling the future, or it might be recorded simply because the dreamer finds the dream in some way compelling, troubling, or funny. In life writing, dreams often highlight crucial moments in the writer’s life experience. Just as psychoanalysts make use of dreams to engage with analysands, Tibetan medical texts instruct doctors to pay close attention to patients’ dreams in the process of diagnosis. Tibetan ritual texts guide meditators in techniques for lucid dreaming. Visionary dreams are recorded in great aesthetic detail. Narratives of dreams and dreamscapes are an important part of biographies and life writing in general. We will also consider European and American treatments of dreams and lucid dreaming, including psychoanalytic, philosophical approaches to dreaming.

RELI UN2205,BUDDHISM: INDO-TIBETAN,"Buddhist teachings came to Tibet relatively late in the history of Buddhism’s travels through Asia. Tibetan emperors adopted Buddhism from India around the eighth century, which sounds like a long time ago now, but by that time Buddhism was already well established in parts of South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia. In addition to being known as a tradition of renunciants and forest dwelling philosophers, Buddhism was associated with cosmopolitanism—literacy, the arts, architecture, higher education and beyond. Tibetan rulers, like so many rulers before them, turned to Buddhism after amassing power through warfare and violence, and they became interested in Buddhism’s methods for cultivating wisdom and compassion as antidotes to ignorance and selfishness. They were also curious about whether Buddhism could help justify and support their claims to power. Because Buddhism was already a complex system, Tibetans were able to uniquely integrate all three of the major traditions of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism. Thanks to the hard work of Tibetan and Indian translators and artists with imperial support, monks and nuns followed the rules of the earliest disciples of Buddha, philosophers pored over Indian Buddhist treatises, and ritualists fine-tuned the tantric, esoteric, intensive path to liberation from dissatisfaction and suffering. The new expressions of Buddhism that emerged in Tibet have shaped religion, education, literary production, the arts, and language across a massive and diverse swath of Asia, from northern India to Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, and areas of Western China. More recently, Tibetan Buddhism has spread across the globe. In this course, by analyzing primary textual sources in translation as well as visual and material culture, we will investigate the history and practice of Tibetan Buddhism in all its complexity, from its earliest origins to the present.

RUSS UN3107,Russian Through Theater,"Russian Through Theater is a content-based language course designed for students who already have the equivalent of two semesters of college-level Russian and want to continue exploring their path as Russian language learners. This course is experimental in that it combines elements of traditional language learning with theatricality and creativity.  A stress-free learning environment will stimulate language skills and fluency. Staging skits, theatrical pieces, short at first and longer by the end of the semester, will encourage students to focus on phonetics, intonation contour, and idiomatic expressions. In addition to performing skits and short plays, the course includes various forms of improvisation. Reading, listening and speaking - these three essential skills of language learning are constantly practiced. Incorporating theater into language learning not only makes the process enjoyable but also creates a rich, immersive environment that supports language development holistically. Various performative and ludic models, offered by the theater productions -- rehearsed and improvised alike – will help students with shaping a language persona, a skill that students may use in life situations. This skill adds confidence to their conduct of language and allows to communicate effectively with limited linguistic knowledge.
  
Classes will be conducted primarily in Russian, with sporadic instruction in English when necessary for clarification of assignments or for better understanding of terminology used during mini-lectures.",Tatiana Mikhailova,5:00pm,6:40pm,10930,,W3107-20261-001,,Slavic Languages,RUSS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RUSS/W3107-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,2,,W,20261RUSS3107W001,SEMINAR
RUSS UN3221,LIT & REVOLUTION (20TH C LIT),"The revolutionary period (1905-1938) in Russia was not only one of extreme social upheaval but also of exceptional creativity. Established ideas about individuality and collectivity, about how to depict reality, about language, gender, authority, and violence, were all thrown open to radical questioning. Out of this chaos came ideas about literature and film (just for example) which have shaped Western thought on these subjects to this day.

And we will consider the public health issues and the policy issues, both local and international, that arise because of these many important uses.",James J Valentini,2:40pm,3:55pm,11471,,W1900-20261-001,,Chemistry,SCNC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SCNC/W1900-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20261SCNC1900W001,LECTURE
SCPP BC3338,Science-based evidence in policymaking,"In all societies, public policies are developed to solve social problems such as extreme
 poverty, inequality, basic sanitation, health and basic care, family planning, food
 security, mental health, abuse of illegal substances, education and protection of
 vulnerable groups. How can we ensure that these public policies are based on solid
 evidence, which would guarantee the greatest probability of effectiveness? And how do
 we plan and adapt the implementation of these policies to different realities, respecting
 cultural and historical differences?
  
 In order to achieve this, it is useful, if not necessary, to be acquainted with scientific
 thinking and the accumulation and use of evidence. It is also necessary to understand
 our own limitations and cognitive biases that interfere in the decision-making process,
 as well as understand the political and social context where decisions need to be made.
 This course aims to provide students with the tools necessary to assess public policies
 critically and rationally, as well as to evaluate different types of scientific evidence and
 understand how and where it is appropriate to include scientific evidence in building
 effective public policy.",Natalia Pasternak Taschner,10:10am,12:00pm,00808,,X3338-20261-001,Science & Policymaking,Science and Public Policy @Barnard,SCPP,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SCPP/X3338-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20261SCPP3338X001,SEMINAR
SDEV GU4050,US WATER & ENERGY POLICY,"Course Summary: Water, one of humankind’s first power sources, remains critically important to the task of maintaining a sustainable energy supply, in the United States and elsewhere. Conversely, the need to provide safe drinking water and keep America’s rivers clean cannot be met without access to reliable energy supplies. As the impact of climate disruption and other resource constraints begins to mount, the water/energy nexus is growing increasingly complex and conflict-prone. Essential Connections begins by examining the development of America’s water and energy policies over the past century and how such policies helped to shape present-day environmental law and regulation. Our focus then turns to the current state of US water and energy resources and policy, covering issues such as oil and gas exploration, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power and renewables. We also examine questions of inclusion and equity in connection with the ways in which communities allocate their water and energy resources and burdens along racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. The third and final section of the course addresses the prospects for establishing water and energy policies that can withstand climate disruption, scarcity and, perhaps most importantly, America’s seemingly endless appetite for political dysfunction. By semester’s end, students will better understand the state of America’s energy and water supply systems and current efforts to cope with depletion, climate change and related threats affecting these critical, highly-interdependent systems. As a final project, students will utilize the knowledge gained during the semester to create specific proposals for preserving and enhancing the sustainability of US water and energy resources.",Paul A Gallay,4:10pm,6:00pm,11587,,W4050-20261-001,,Earth Institute,SDEV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/W4050-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261SDEV4050W001,SEMINAR
SDEV GU4325,"Plants, Animals and Personhood","This course is intended to be an opportunity to review the relation between the word “person” and plants and animals, with whom humans abide in a biosphere with no natural boundaries or territories.  While personhood is a recognition of human capability and agency, we have not taken many steps in the direction of recognizing the capability and agency of plants and animals.  Moreover, it is clear that we have diminished many of their functions and even annihilated many of their entire populations.  Nonetheless, there is movement to change this. In our course, three major features of personhood are explored: standing, rights and identity.  Each of these three features are divided into two types:  legal and spiritual standing, juridical and birth rights, and empirical and narrative identities.  Animals and plants are discussed in the context of each of the six types; and are discussed in that order (animals first and plants second) because the movement to change the existing conditions has been more active in relation to animals than to plants.  The growing tendency to blend both plant personhood and animal personhood into environmental or Nature personhood will also be explored.  The overall aim is to help reverse the deleterious conditions generated by the Anthropocene, in which we, and the plants and animals, struggle to live.",Adela J Gondek,1:10pm,2:25pm,11853,,W4325-20261-001,"PLANTS, ANIMALS & PERSONH",Earth Institute,SDEV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/W4325-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20261SDEV4325W001,SEMINAR

SDEV GU4680,Climate and Sustainable Water Systems,"Sustainable water supply, essential for life, is complex and challenging, particularly in the context of climate change. Changing climate affects the availability and quality of water globally. In turn, human use of water produces greenhouse gasses (GHGs) that further exacerbate climate change. Spanning global and individual scale, this course will examine changing interactions of climate and water, implications for human water supply, and steps toward greater sustainability.
  
Part 1
 of the course establishes baseline understanding of natural and human water systems in the context of climate change. What it takes to transform water from its source to “fit-for-purpose” water for domestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural uses will be examined. The implications of climate change for water systems and the impacts of water development on climate change will also be assessed. The growing challenges of water security, water quality, and water affordability/accessibility will be considered, along with institutional models for water delivery.
  
Part 2
 will delve into pathways toward more sustainable water supplies, with emphasis on safe and affordable drinking water. Means of adaptation and resilience will be explored, from evolving human uses to optimizing water storage and delivery. Throughout Part 2, case studies will bring concepts to reality, engaging students in further exploring strategies and actions to address crucial issues for water sustainability. Practicing leaders from the water field will bring real-world perspectives as guest speakers, sharing direct experience with a specific problem, and engaging with the class in a broader discussion of the issues, led by the instructor.",Cindy Paulson,2:10pm,4:00pm,12029,,W4680-20261-001,CLIM & SUSTAINABLE WATER,Earth Institute,SDEV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/W4680-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20261SDEV4680W001,SEMINAR

SDEV IA9248,Collective Action for Global Sustainable,"When externalities go uncorrected, and public goods go undersupplied, the reason is not that the market fails; the reason is that governments are unable or unwilling to intervene effectively. The biggest problem is with transnational externalities and regional and global public goods. This is partly because of the scale of these problems, but it is also because the institutional arrangements at this level make effective intervention difficult. There is no World Government. Instead, there are around 200 sovereign states. To support sustainable development globally, states must cooperate, and yet states' self-interests often conflict with their collective interests. This is why all countries agree that collective action must be taken to limit climate change, and yet, though they try and try again, countries seem unable to muster the individual action needed to meet their own collective goal. The aim of this course is to develop an apparatus for understanding international collective action for sustainable development. By an apparatus, I mean a theory, a structured way of looking at and understanding the world. Rather than just present the theory, my aim is to show you why theory is needed, how it has been constructed, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Basically, in addition to teaching you principles and tools, I want you to come to see how this field has developed, what it has achieved, and where it has fallen short. Throughout the course, we shall also be looking at tests and applications of the theory-empirical and experimental papers in addition to case studies. The course draws from a number of disciplines, especially economics, game theory (analytical and experimental), and international relations-but also international law, philosophy, history, the natural and physical sciences, and engineering. The focus will be on institutions, and the way that they restructure the relations among states to cause states to behave differently-that is, to cause them to undertake collective action. In terms of applications, the course will address not only climate change but also depletion of the ozone layer, trans-boundary air pollution, pollution of the oceans, over-fishing, biodiversity loss, and the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.",Scott Barrett,1:10pm,3:00pm,10260,,U9248-20261-001,Collective Action-Global,PHD-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,SDEV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/U9248-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,W,20261SDEV9248U001,SEMINAR

In the past two years, Large Language Models (LLMs) built using transformer frameworks have emerged as the fastest-growing area of research and investment in AI/machine learning. Recent releases of chatbots such as ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bing (Microsoft), and Bard (Google) quickly reached hundreds of millions of users and have become the face of artificial intelligence for consumers. There has also been an explosion in the number of applications that depend on LLMs for a variety of more specialized tasks. Recent models have shown impressive performance on both canonical machine learning tasks and for everyday use, yet are in many ways poorly understood and, in some cases, exhibit unexpected and potentially harmful behavior.

A small cohort is admitted each year, combining structured seminars with individualized faculty mentorship to guide students from proposal development through the completion and defense of their final thesis.

SOCI BC3202,Structural Drivers of Health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Drivers of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the ""Social"" ""Determinants"" of Health to the “Structural” ""Drivers"" of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact  and drive health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes.",Maati Momplaisir,6:10pm,7:25pm,00018,,X3202-20261-001,STRUCTURAL DETERMNTS OF H,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/X3202-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261SOCI3202X001,LECTURE

SOCI GR6090,QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS,"The course is designed to introduce PhD students in Sociology to the basic techniques for collecting, interpreting, analyzing, and reporting interview and observational data. The readings and practical exercises we will do together are designed to expand your technical skillset, inspire your thinking, to show you the importance of working collaboratively with intellectual peers, and to give you experiential knowledge of various kinds of fieldwork.
  
Mostly, though, students will learn how to conduct indictive field-based analyses. There are many versions of this model, including Florian Znaniecki’s “analytic induction,” Barney Glaser and Anselm Straus’ “grounded theory,” John Stuart Mill’s system of inductive logic, the Bayesian approach to inference in statistics, and much of what computationally-intensive researchers refer to as data mining. This course will expose students to ways of thinking about their research shared by many of these different inductive perspectives. Remember, though, that all of these formulations of analytic work are ideal types. The actual field, and actual field workers, are often far more complex.
  
For that reason, this course focuses not merely on theory, but also, and fundamentally, on practice. While some skills like producing a code book or formulating a hypothesis can be developed through reading and reflection, the field demands more nuanced skillsets that can only be attained by trial and error. How do you get an honest answer to a painful or embarrassing question? How do we know that the researcher interviewed enough people? Or spent enough time in the field? Or asked the right questions? Or did not distort the truth? My hope is that by the end of class you will have done enough fieldwork to have arrived at a good set of answers, and to begin developing the ability to communicate your answers to others.
  
A note on intellectual parentage: The particular approach to training in this course is based on a qualitative bootcamp developed by Mario Small for Harvard’s Ph.d cohorts. Other methods courses focus on particular technical skills rather than analytic frames, or merely on empirical work itself, rather than secondary literature on method. This is one way to think through analytic training.

SPAN BC3693,Disability Narratives in Latin America,"This course surveys Latin American literary texts that have deeply engaged with disability in the
 20 th and 21 st century. Against the tendency to treat disability merely as a useful metaphor or to
 simply import Global Northern vocabulary and methodologies of disability studies to other
 locations, this course turns to Latin American literary texts by authors that have been directly
 “touched” by disability to foreground the concerns, vocabularies, and commitments that their
 texts reveal. This includes authors who either through their personal experience with disability
 or as caretakers—as parents, siblings, or close friends of people with disabilities—have closely
 grappled with the experience of non-normative bodies and minds in the Latin American
 context. In this course we ask how are subjects with disabilities represented in a variety of
 genres (novel, essay, poem, graphic novel) and what constraints and possibilities circumscribe
 these subjectivities and their lives. Ultimately, we will ask what vision of disability justice
 emerges from these localized experiences and creative interventions beyond now globalized
 disability discourses of inclusion/access and independence/autonomy.",Maja Horn,12:10pm,2:00pm,00184,,X3693-20261-001,Disability Narratives Lat,Spanish and Latin American Culture,SPAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/X3693-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261SPAN3693X001,SEMINAR

SPAN GU4030,SPANISH PRAGMATICS,"In one sense, Pragmatics is concerned with how we use the language, why and how the speakers communicate in social interactions. The interpretation of meaning in context is probably the main field of study of this multidiscipline, considering the speaker-meaning as the central point of departure. The term Pragmatics refers to a broad perspective on different aspects of communication, including linguistics, but also cognitive psychology, cultural anthropology, philosophy, sociology and rhetoric among others. Through this course we will study chronologically and apply in specific cases of study of the Spanish language the most meaningful pragmatic theories, such as: Context, Deixis, Speech acts, Implicature, Cooperative Principle, Politeness, Relevance, Pragmatic markers, Metaphors and Cross-cultural pragmatics. Pragmatics, as we know, is a most helpful criterion in the interpretation of many different types of texts. As a course within our Departments curriculum this instrument of rhetoric analysis is a basic tool in the comprehension of our students discourse in their literary, cultural, and critical papers. This discipline goes beyond the analysis of strictly forms or verbal utterances, hence its multidisciplinary applicability to a wide range of fields of studies in Spanish. Whichever the students field of study might be, Pragmatics provides a valuable and accurate vocabulary that can be applied to any textual interpretation. In this course, the pragmatic perspective is a starting point to delve into the processes of communication in Spanish. After this first approach, the student will gain an insight into new aspects of the linguistics of language use in general and the use of Spanish in particular.",Francisco Rosales-Varo,1:10pm,2:25pm,12009,,W4030-20261-001,,Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPAN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/W4030-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20261SPAN4030W001,LECTURE

SPAN UN2103,INTERMED SPAN II - MEDICAL,"Prerequisites: SPAN UN2101 or a score of 450-625 on the Department’s placement examination. This is an intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. * This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), or have a score of 450-625 on the Department’s placement exam, and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences—including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

SPAN UN3361,ARTISTIC HUMANITY,"Between 1400 and 1600, in the context of the Iberian conquest and colonization of the “four parts of the world,"" artifacts were looted, melted, and destroyed; other objects traveled between continents in physical and textual forms. They were sent and offered as proof of the new territories, desired and collected. The powerful subtlety of unexpected artistic forms, media, and monuments triggered a new space of inquiry. Novel materials, techniques, and ideas about artistry were observed far and near—in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa, and in Europe. They were also described, compared and analyzed in letters, histories, or inventories. All around a sphere that could now be mentally embraced, missionaries, collectors, historians, and artists felt under the power of novel creations: intricate shell jewelries, wood and stone sculptures, turquoise masks, feather mosaics, painted manuscripts and folding screens, ivory spoons, carved temples, monumental cities, and so on. These splendid artworks deeply challenged conceptual boundaries such as those between: idol and image, beautiful and frightening, civilized and barbarian, center and periphery, classic and modern, and ancient and new. The artworks and their descriptions contributed to define humanity as immanently creative and to conceive artistic creation as a distinctive form of thought.

The course will be focused on inference and modeling approaches such as the EM algorithm, MCMC methods and Bayesian modeling, linear regression models, generalized linear regression models, nonparametric regressions, and statistical computing. In addition, the course will provide introduction to statistical methods and modeling that addresses various practical issues such as design of experiments, analysis of time-dependent data, missing values, etc. Throughpout the course, real-data examples will be used in lecture discussion and homework problems. This course lays the statistical foundation for inference and modeling using data, preparing the MS in Data Science students, for other courses in machine learning, data mining and visualization.",Dobrin Marchev,6:10pm,7:25pm,14271,,W5703-20261-001,,Statistics,STAT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/STAT/W5703-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Engineering:Graduate,3,"STAT GR5701

SUMA K6120,"SUMA PS6120 Equity, Policy, and Sustaina","Public policy shapes how our environment, both natural and built, is managed and regulated. Policy not only creates the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks needed to support sustainability goals, but is also critical in establishing an equitable foundation that supports individual and collective change in pursuit of those goals.
  
This course will serve as an introduction to equity in sustainability policy: We will survey federal, state, and local policies and proposals to understand how we use policy to enhance urban resilience, mitigate environmental impacts, and also promote social and economic justice. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws from economics, sociology, urban studies, critical theory, and more, students will develop their capacities to read and interpret policy, enhance their understanding of current policy frameworks, and strengthen their ability to engage with emerging policy developments.
  
Building on contemporary efforts in public policy, we will use an equity lens to focus on the human dimension of sustainability. We will explore policy frameworks and dialogues that foster more equitable outcomes, increase engagement of people most impacted, and contribute to sustainability goals. As an entry point, the course will focus on policies related to climate adaptation and urban sustainability transitions, setting the stage for students to explore equity in urban resilience efforts and to examine intersections of race, class, and other social factors with access to resources.
  
The course will be discussion-based and center participatory activities (e.g., student-led discussions, paired analyses, team exercises) designed to encourage students to consider policy issues from multiple perspectives—including identifying disparities and assessing opportunities for increasing equity in the sustainability policy sector. The course will also invite scholars and practitioners to share expertise and experience from the field.

SUMA PS4235,SCIENCE OF URBAN ECOLOGY,"Urban ecology is the study of both the interactions between organisms in an urban environment and the organisms' interactions with that environment. This course facilitates learning about 1) basic principles related to ecological interactions of life on Earth, 2) the causes and consequences of biological patterns and processes in urban environments, and 3) how ecology can inform land use decisions and applied management strategies of natural resources (e.g. water, air, biodiversity), particularly in urban environments. This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the ways in which ecological perspectives can contribute to an interdisciplinary approach to solving environmental problems facing human society. Towards that end, this course covers topics ranging from applied ecology and conservation biology to sustainable development. It uses a cross disciplinary approach to understand the nature of ecology and biological conservation, as well as the social, philosophical and economic dimensions of land use strategies. Although in some ways cities may seem to be isolated from what we would otherwise call ""nature,"" they are not, and this is a major theme of this course. This course includes discussion of biodiversity, ecosystem function, evolutionary processes, nutrient cycling, and natural resource availability in cities. Students will acquire an understanding of the ecology of human-dominated landscapes, the theory and study of urban ecology, and the application of ecological principles to building sustainable urban communities.

SUMA PS4236,Reversing the Biodiversity Crisis,"Course Overview
  
Often described as “twin crises,” climate change and biodiversity loss are among the most urgent sustainability challenges to be addressed in our modern era. While much focus has rightfully been placed on climate change mitigation actions at local, regional, and global scales, biodiversity loss is less often addressed by governments, institutions, industries, and individuals as a critical piece of the sustainability puzzle. In 2021, COP 15, the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, received far less media attention than COP 26, the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change. Yet climate change and biodiversity loss are inextricably linked, and without biodiversity and the associated ecosystem services and biospheric resilience upon which human society relies, a sustainable world is not possible. Moreover, certain climate change mitigation actions can actually be to the detriment of biological diversity.
  
 
  
Unlike a traditional conservation biology course geared towards ecologists and biologists, this course will be taught through the lens of sustainability management, equipping sustainability managers with the knowledge and direction needed to begin integrating biodiversity conservation and restoration into their professions. This course will illuminate the critical importance of biodiversity to sustainability and human well-being, the science and politics behind the current biodiversity crisis, and proposals, policies, and actions for bending the curve of biodiversity loss to create more sustainable and equitable outcomes for both humans and the non-humans with which we share our planet.
  
 
  
Students who seek to deepen their understanding of ecological sustainability and address the biodiversity crisis through the lens of sustainability management are encouraged to take this course. This course is an on-campus (or Hy-Flex) elective offered during the Fall semester and fulfills 3 credits within the Physical Dimensions of Sustainability Management curriculum area in the Master of Science in Sustainability Management program. Cross-registration is available to students outside of the Master of Science in Sustainability Management program, space permitting.",Amy Karpati,8:10pm,10:00pm,11676,,K4236-20261-001,Reversing the Biodiversit,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K4236-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,M,20261SUMA4236K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS4238,"Biodiversity, Climate Change and Sustain","Biodiversity, a term popularized in the 1980s, refers to the variety of life at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. It is crucial for sustainability, as it supports ecosystems that underpin human life, economic activities, and ecological stability. The loss of biodiversity threatens essential ecosystem services like clean air, water filtration, climate regulation, and food security. This course explores how climate change, both current and projected, impacts biodiversity and how natural ecosystems influence greenhouse gas concentrations. Human survival depends on these ecosystems, yet there is uncertainty about how much biodiversity loss can be tolerated. Climate change now poses as serious a threat to biodiversity as direct development activities. Understanding the science behind these threats is essential for sustainability students, and this course aims to provide that knowledge.
  
Simultaneously, tropical deforestation across the globe produces CO2 emissions equal to the total current emissions of the United States.  Forest fires in Canada have produced emissions equal to the total fossil fuel based emissions of that country.  Thawing of permafrost in the arctic north is one of the positive feedback loops, warming leading to more warming that has catastrophic potential. In studying biodiversity, we will examine ecosystems and species such as muskoxen, whales, penguins, primates, tree frogs, and monarch butterflies. We will also explore human practices like agriculture, forest management, hunting, and fishing, which affect both carbon and biodiversity and rely on climate stability. Students will learn how climate and natural ecosystems interact, a crucial first step toward actions needed to sustain life on Earth. While some readings may be challenging for those without an ecology background, support will be available. Students with prior ecology knowledge should find the course particularly informative.",Ralph C Schmidt,6:10pm,8:00pm,11678,,K4238-20261-001,"Biodiversity, Climate Cha",Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K4238-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20261SUMA4238K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS4310,PRAC-INNOVATV SUSTAIN LEADRSHP,"This course deals with a fundamental question of sustainability management: how to change organizations and more complex systems, such as communities, industries, and markets, by integrating sustainability concerns in the way that they operate. The course poses this question to a dozen leading sustainability practitioners, who answer it by discussing management strategies that they use in their own work. Through these guest lectures, extensive class discussion, readings, and writing assignments, students identify and simulate applying practical ways for transforming how organizations and complex systems work. The practitioners, who work in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors and in a wide variety of organizations, make presentations in the first hour of the course. Students then have time to ask questions and speak informally with the guest practitioners, and will participate in an instructor-led class discussion, geared toward identifying management strategies, better understanding their application, and considering their effectiveness. By the end of the course, the students gain an understanding of management tools and strategies that they, themselves, would use to integrate sustainability in organizations.
  
The course complements the M.S. in Sustainability Management program’s required course, Sustainability Management (SUMA K4100). In that course, students study management and organization theory.

Migrating between multiple cultural and sociopolitical contexts, and between the individual and metropolitan, national and indigenous levels of policymaking, the course will look at how today’s cities have evolved; the consequential disconnect between enshrined legal frameworks, regulatory and administrative structures, and concrete urban realities; and at how, through a sustainable process of inclusive community and private sector engagement, responsive design, and strategic budgeting to realize select well-defined priorities, tomorrow’s cities can be better attuned to the human scale of their primary constituents by becoming more aware, inclusive, accommodating and enabling of women and families. Each week, one or more leading and cutting-edge thinkers and practitioners in the areas of urban and environmental design and management, corporate social responsibility, landscape architecture and planning, sustainable engineering, and urban health,  wellbeing and women’s rights will share their experience, current thinking and ideas in featured guest lectures; these will be followed by wide-ranging conversations among the instructor, lecturers and students, enabling students to hear firsthand how private, public and non-profit sector managers, policymakers and designers approach and deal with such issues as (for instance) making transport hubs equally navigable for women with strollers, walkers or young children, or implementing green or family-friendly CSR policies.",Susan M Blaustein,6:10pm,8:00pm,11680,,K4490-20261-001,WOMEN IN CITIES: SUST URB,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K4490-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,W,20261SUMA4490K001,LECTURE

The years ahead will reveal the negative side effects and blind spots of conventional strategy tools, which often focus on short-termism, profit maximization, and share price. Historically, social expectations of businesses have been limited to the creation of wealth for owners and shareholders as well as the creation of jobs and economic development for the communities in which they operate. This limited set of expectations has allowed managers to focus on profit maximization as their primary objective and source of value creation. 
  
Transformative business models, however, will become increasingly important as businesses face the challenges of climate change, resource scarcity and social inequity that dominate today’s competitive business landscape. Acquiring the skills to help navigate these conditions will be essential to businesses that seek to thrive and foster a more sustainable world and create shared stakeholder value. 
  
This course will explore the fundamental role of business in contributing to a more sustainable and just world and the emerging strategies companies are using to align business value creation with social and environmental impacts.  How corporations successfully balance the expectations and interests of stakeholders with profit maximization will be explored. This course will also identify the impacts, risks, and opportunities that leadership must assess and develop strategies to address. The course will explore the benefits of ESG/Sustainability in business, how for-profit businesses can thrive in a competitive setting while still creating long-term stakeholder value, and how companies have embedded ESG strategies, plans and programs to address their related challenges and opportunities.

The aim is to foster a mindful, yet critical discourse on fashion industry initiatives, past and present, and to practice various tools that help transition existing organizations and incubate new startups towards sustainable outcomes.",Ammar Belal,6:10pm,8:00pm,13187,,K5060-20261-001,SUST FASHION & STARTUP ST,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5060-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20261SUMA5060K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5135,ANALYSIS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"Energy Management is the cornerstone of any sustainability initiative. The generation, distribution, and use of energy has a profound, continuous, and global impact on natural resources, societal structure, and geopolitics. How energy is used has significant repercussions on an organizations cash flow and profitability. For these reasons, energy issues tend to be the fulcrum upon which sustainability programs hinge.
  
The ability to identify and articulate organizational benefits from energy savings tied to efficiency improvements and renewable energy projects is a requisite skill set for all sustainability managers.
  
This course will provide real-world information on energy management issues from a practitioner's perspective. Through lectures, problem sets, and readings students will learn how to manage energy audits, analyze building energy performance, and evaluate the energy use and financial impacts of potential capital and operations improvements to building systems. The class will focus on understanding energy issues from a building owner’s perspective, with discussions also examining energy issues from the perspective of utility companies, energy generators, and policy makers.
  
Best practice in energy management will always involve some level of complex engineering to survey existing conditions and predict energy savings from various improvement options. Sustainability managers need to understand how to manage and quality control these analyses and to translate to decision makers the opportunity they reveal. This course seeks to empower students to do that by providing an understanding of building systems and methods for quantitatively analyzing the potential benefit of various energy improvements.",Thomas Sahagian,6:10pm,8:00pm,13189,,K5135-20261-001,ANALYSIS FOR ENERGY EFFIC,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5135-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20261SUMA5135K001,LECTURE

SUMA PS5250,Building a Sustainable Detroit:  A Case,"Once known as the arsenal of Democracy, the birthplace of the automobile assembly line, and the model city of America, 21st Century Detroit was emblematic of deindustrialization, decay, and insolvency.  Following the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, Detroit is now being reframed in both local and national media as a comeback city with opportunity and possibility for all - urban pioneers, global investors, a creative class of new professionals, and suburbanites seeking a return to urban grit.
  
Despite these narratives, Detroit remains highly segregated - racially, geographically, economically, and socially.  While downtown is prospering, neighborhoods are still largely blighted and contaminated with legacy uses that remain unremediated.  Over 30,000 houses and other structures have been demolished in the past 8 years, a process that is under-regulated and contributes to both environmental and infrastructure harm.  To the extent new investments are improving the condition of housing and infrastructure in some strategic areas, these investments are displacing long term residents who remain at risk of eviction or foreclosure from their homes. Detroit remains one of the poorest big city in America and the poverty that remains is seemingly intractable.  At present, only 36% of residents earn a living wage.
  
Detroit’s present condition  is rooted in a protracted history of racist laws, policies, and practices that deny full citizenship to Black Detroiters, undermine Democracy, and position the city as a poor colony within a thriving metropolis.  Racism has disfigured the social, physical and economic landscape of Detroit to produce profound levels of neglect, abuse, and exploitation of its residents, resulting in wealth extraction, housing insecurity, healthy food and water scarcity, educational malpractice, and environmental destruction, all within the framework of wealth attraction, tax incentives, subsidized growth and capital accumulation in the greater downtown.
  
Through this course, we will examine the thesis that sustainability and racism cannot co-exist; that sustainability is rooted in inclusive social wellbeing now and in future generations, whereas racism is rooted in hoarding of power and resources for one dominant group. This hoarding of resources for a favored population impairs preservation for future generations.   Furthermore, environmental racism disconnects the consequences of environmental destruction from its beneficiari",Donna Givens Davidson,6:10pm,8:00pm,13197,,K5250-20261-D01,Building a Sustainable De,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5250-20261-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,W,20261SUMA5250KD01,LECTURE

SUMA PS5446,Sustainability Value Creation in Private,"This course provides an overview of the way sustainability (environmental, social and governance) factors are analyzed in private markets. It focuses on preparing students to implement their understanding of the financial and societal risks and opportunities within the investment making process. In private markets, limited partners (pension funds, endowments, high net-worth individuals) have pushed the sustainability imperative and social consciousness of private equity funds and asset managers by seeking greater clarity around how their money is invested in both a responsible and financially meaningful way. Alongside this trend, an evolving regulatory environment globally has propelled the need to systemize evaluation frameworks for stakeholders within investment functions and advisors who support them.Unlike public markets, sustainability information is harder to glean in private markets and requires a skilled extraction and evaluation process. During this course, we examine a traditional ESG due diligence process embedded within the wider investment lifecycle (sourcing, diligence, hold and exit) through the lens of changing geographic regulatory landscape in financial investing and the market leading frameworks that quantify ESG factors for evaluation. The course culminates with a deal due diligence process that mimics an investment committee (IC) comprised of private equity leaders that understand the commercial and purpose-driven viability of an investment.",Angela Jhanji,4:10pm,6:00pm,11712,,K5446-20261-001,Sustainability Value Crea,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5446-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,M,20261SUMA5446K001,LECTURE
SUMA PS5470,CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR SUSTAINABILITY PROF,"Throughout history, societies have discovered resources, designed and developed them into textiles,
  
tools and structures, and bartered and exchanged these goods based on their respective values.
  
Economies emerged, driven by each society’s needs and limited by the resources and technology
  
available to them. Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the
  
overextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast
  
technological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of
  
the disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a “take-make’-
  
waste” manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our
  
planet’s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological
  
advancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;
  
which begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?
  
The premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative
  
economic future are available to us. By looking at resources’ potential, we can shape alternative methods
  
of procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,
  
products and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into
  
both the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and
  
restoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications
  
required in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially
  
transformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic
  
structures, systems and processes.
  
This is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability
  
leaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us
  
(as rapidly as we need) into a more sustaining future. The class will be comprised of a series of lectures,

SUMA PS5710,Electrification and Decarbonization,"Electricity is the lifeblood of human society. Decarbonization of global economies through electrification is seen as the most viable path for reducing GHG emissions and addressing the worst effects of climate change. Though generally accepted as the best path forward, an understanding of the operational parameters of the electric system is essential to understanding both the benefits and limitations of current and future actions. This includes the highly visible investments in renewable energy generation, less visible but equally important investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the largely personal, private choices of individual households and businesses.
  
The course will examine pathways for the transition from fossil fuel-based electricity generation to one dominated by electricity generated by renewable energy. Students will examine the drivers of past energy transitions and various factors influencing current energy systems. At the conclusion of the course, students will be able understand the drivers of past energy transitions, the impact of those drivers on the overall energy supply chain, and how new technologies (e.g. distributed energy resources, smart meters, internet of things (IOT), etc.), consumer adoption of mass market products (e.g. Electric Vehicles, battery backup, etc,) and evolving consumer expectations (e.g. fast charging) are altering long held assumptions about energy production and use.

SUMA PS5888,Geographies of Environmental Justice and,"The origin of the American Environmental Justice Movement can be traced back to the emergence of the American
 Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and more specifically to the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. These historical
 moments set the stage for a movement that continues to grow with present challenges and widening of economic,
 health and environmental disparities between racial groups and socioeconomic groups. The environmental justice
 movement builds upon the philosophy and work of environmentalism, which focuses on humanity’s adverse impact
 upon the environment, entailing both human and non-human existence. However, environmental justice stresses the
 manner in which adversely impacting the environment in turn adversely impacts the population of that environment.
  
 At the heart of the environmental justice movement are the issues of racism and socioeconomic injustice.
 This course will examine the intersections of race, equity, and the environment – focusing on history and the
 growing role and impact of the environmental justice movement in shaping new sustainability discourses, ethics,
 policies, and plans for the twenty-first century. Environmental Justice embeds various disciplines into its analytical
 framework ranging from human geography and history to urban studies, economics, sociology, environmental
 science, public policy, community organizing, and more. Drawing from these disciplines, as well as from recent
 policies, advocacy, and regulations, students will develop a deeper understanding of equity, sustainability, social
 impact, and environmental justice in places and spaces across the nation.
  
 Building on the broadness of environmental justice and sustainability, this course will use the geography lens and
 frameworks, building on the concept that geography brings together the physical and human dimensions of the
 world in the study of people, places, and environments. Geography will set the stage for us to explore a variety of
 environmental justice topics and issues in different regions across the nation, from the Black Belt South to the Rust
 Belt to Cancer Alley, New Orleans, and Atlanta; then back to New York City and the metropolitan area, introducing
 students to initiatives, policies, stakeholders, research, community groups, and advocacy involved in the
 development and implementation of environmental laws, policies, practices, equity-based solutions, and sustainable
 infrastructure.",John E Williams,6:10pm,8:00pm,11718,,K5888-20261-001,Environmental Justice and,Sustainability Management,SUMA,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5888-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20261SUMA5888K001,LECTURE

SUSC PS5020,PRED EFFCT CLIMATE CHNGE ON GLOB FORESTS,"Forests are often called the lungs of the earth, for their role in converting atmospheric CO2 into the life-sustaining Oxygen that we all breathe. Collectively, the global forests contribute to roughly 40% of the annual global carbon sink, and yet little is known about the drivers of terrestrial carbon sequestration, and the processes involved in these systems response to changes in climate. Forested landscapes also comprise some of the most critical habitats on planet Earth, by serving as refuge to diverse and often endangered flora and fauna, and as regulators of water and soils. These services are particularly important for highland regions where forests are heavily exploited and are often the primary source of water and food for marginalized human populations. This course takes an in-depth look into the current, primary literature on the direct and indirect effects of climate change on forest ecosystems around the globe, and examines some of the primary policy solutions to forest loss mitigation and sustainability. Because the instructor is from the LDEO Tree Ring Lab there will be an emphasis on using dendrochronology for understanding changes in biomass for forest environments, with emphasis on the broadleaf forests of eastern North America and the largely coniferous, fire-prone forests of the American West. Students will have access to multiple sources of data, including satellite, forest inventory, tree rings and eddy-flux measurements. The course will have a field component that will take place at the Black Rock Forest (BRF), about two hours north of NYC. Students will conduct primary research for a final project, with the goal being to develop a set of group projects related to forests and climate change. This course will prepare students to assess the impacts of climate extremes on forest systems and to understand the complexities of response possibilities from diverse ecosystems.
  
This course will combine lectures and assigned course readings to develop the framework for understanding global forest response to climate change. Each class will begin with a 5-question mini-quiz based upon the assigned readings and the previous lecture. This class will discuss the questions asked, techniques used and key findings of the papers, with discussions led by the students. The class includes a field trip to Black Rock Forest (dates TBD) where students will collect data for use in a class project, thereby providing the opportunity to develop skills in field research and data analysis.",Mukund P Rao,4:10pm,6:00pm,13255,,K5020-20261-001,PRED EFF CLIM CHNGE GLBL FRSTS,Sustainability Science,SUSC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUSC/K5020-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,R,20261SUSC5020K001,LECTURE
SUSC PS5030,OBSERVING AND UNDERSTANDING SEA LEVEL CH,"This course provides an overview of the science related to observing and understanding sea-level rise, which has a profound impact on the sustainability of coastal cities and ecosystems. In modern research, sea-level rise is viewed as a complex response of the Earth “system of systems” to climate change. Measuring ongoing sea-level change is challenging due to the great natural variability of sea level on short time scales caused by tides, weather, and ocean currents.  Interpreting measurements so that one can assess (and mitigate against) potential economic and societal impacts of sea-level rise is crucial but can be complicated, since so many Earth-system processes play a role. Some of these processes are related and others are unrelated to climate change; some of the latter are natural and others are of anthropogenic origin. Students enrolled in this course will through lectures and class discussions address topics related to the underlying observational basis for sea-level rise. Given the complexity of sea level rise, it is important for those in technical positions to understand the systems level interactions that not only lead to rising waters but also the consequences that these changes inflict on other parts of our environment. What we hear most commonly is that sea level rise will affect hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas and make those populations susceptible to flooding. But in addition to this community effect, sea level rise also have dramatic effects on coastal habitats, leading to issue such as erosion, soil contamination, and wetland flooding, just to name a few. This course will introduce and prepare students to develop a more comprehensive and holistic approach to sea level rise. By training students to observe, measure, interpret, and begin to predict how sea level rise affects populations and communities differently, students will be in strong positions to address, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges more effectively using evidence-based approaches.",James L Davis,6:10pm,8:00pm,13257,,K5030-20261-001,OBS & UNDRSTNG SEA LEVEL CHNG,Sustainability Science,SUSC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUSC/K5030-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,R,20261SUSC5030K001,LECTURE
SUSC PS5050,GEO INFO SYSTEMS (GIS) FOR SUST SCIENCE,"Many environmental and sustainability science issues have a spatial, location-based component. Increasingly available spatial data allow location-specific analysis and solutions to problems and understanding issues. As result, analyzing and identifying successful and sustainable solutions for these issues often requires the use of spatial analysis and tools. This course introduces common spatial data types and fundamental methods to organize, visualize and analyze those data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Through a combination of lectures and practical computer activities the students will learn and practice fundamental GIS and spatial analysis methods using typical sustainable science case studies and scenarios. A key objective of this course is to provide students with essential GIS skills that will aid them in their professional career and to offer an overview of current GIS applications. In the first part, the course will cover basic spatial data types and GIS concepts. The students will apply those techniques by analyzing potential impacts of storms on New York City as part of a guided case study. A mid-term report describing this case study and the results is required. In the second part, building on the basic concepts introduced in the first part, students will be asked to identify a sustainable science question of their choice that they would like to address as a final project. Together with the instructor they will be developing a strategy of analyzing and presenting related spatial data. While the students are working on their projects additional GIS method and spatial analysis concepts will be covered in class. At the end of the course Students will briefly present their final project and submit a paper describing their project.

SUSC PS5330,Environmental Investigation and Sustaina,"Environmental Investigation and Sustainable Remediation covers the major steps in the investigation, assessment and remediation of contaminated sites. The course will introduce the student to the multidisciplinary aspects of environmental remediation including sustainability considerations, an important background for any environmental career, such as an environmental consultant, a corporate remediation manager or a government regulator. Management and remediation of contaminated sites is an important consideration in sustainable regional development, since failure to control contamination usually yields an ever-increasing area of impact, with greater environmental and societal costs. Using US EPA Superfund guidance as a framework, the course will explore the major steps in identifying a site, establishing the degree of contamination, identifying the likely ecological and human receptors, and selecting and implementing a remedial action. Sustainable remediation in particular has received increased emphasis by the EPA and is now a required component of remedy selection. The Superfund process has been extensively developed through more than 30 years of legislature and agency guidance, and now provides a robust approach for pollution assessment and remediation. Contaminated sites typically involve a broad spectrum of contaminants across at least two media, including soils, sediments, groundwater, surface water, and air. This course examines the main steps involved in environmental investigation and remediation primarily from a technical perspective, although legal aspects will be incorporated at the major decision points in the process. In particular, the course will focus on the main environmental sampling and analytical techniques needed to conduct a remedial investigation, and cover some of the main remedial engineering considerations for the successful selection and implementation of a sustainable and resilient remedy.

It will include an introduction to original performance practices in ancient Greece (space, masking, choral performance, costume, acting techniques) and an examination of how artists from different contemporary theatrical traditions have adapted ancient texts in modern performances and new versions of the plays. The bulk of the course will be focused on the problems of acting, interpreting, and reinterpreting parts of three plays on the stage, Sophocles’ 
Antigone
, Euripides’ 
Medea
, and Sophocles’ 
Ajax
 along with a new version by Ellen McLaughlin, who teaches playwriting at Barnard, 
Ajax in Iraq
. Students will view all or parts of particularly interesting recent productions from various theatrical traditions, which will help them to tackle challenging issues such as choral performance and choral rhythms, masking, character work, dialogues and presenting formal political debates.
  
For contemporary actors training in Greek tragedy offers a unique opportunity to improve their performance on stage through ensemble work and representing character through speech.  It enhances dramaturgical capacities that a contemporary theater practitioner must exercise in exploring theory in practice and vice versa.

Through a grounding in postcolonial theory, students will explore how the colonial encounter leaves a lasting impact on language and performance. How do these playwrights tackle questions of authenticity, influence, inspiration and agency? What stories do they adapt, translate or reimagine? Also, we read in equal measure male and female playwrights, attending to the ways in which power and authority are negotiated by them. This class looks both at plays that are seminal to postcolonial writing and also newer ones that unsettle the position of the greats. Do we then understand postcolonialism as a historically bound literary trend or an ongoing process of exploration?

TPIN IA7002,Policy Solutions for Online Mis/Disinfor,"While 2016 may have been the wake-up call, it is clear that what scholar Joan Donovan calls “the weaponization of the misinformation machine” has only gotten worse since then. The political, social, and psychological damage caused by the intensive dissemination of online mis/disinformation has been profound. However, much has been learned about how to address the problem, so we will emphasize understanding the role of Big Tech in circulating and profiting from online mis/disinformation and what policies/regulations are in play. This semeste,r we are paying particular attention to the aftermath of the 2024 election landscape and the  strange post-truth  environment we find  ourselves  in.  
  
The first part of this course will focus on understanding mis/disinformation online. What exactly is it? Why should we care? What are the implications for Democracy? Who is the cast of characters creating mis/disinformation online? After we’ve understood  these topics we will examine  the fixes being proposed and tried globally. We will consider both the demand and supply side of the problem  and  national context shapes the solutions  being tried. We will look  at the pros  and   cons  of efforts  to  promote responsible news consumption, enhance media literacy, fact-checking, and new regulations. Along the way, we will also discuss content moderation, platform liability, disclosure requirements for election advertising, and support for journalism.

With the veritable explosion of urban data alongside the continued proliferation of new tools for its consideration, this course allows students to develop specialized approaches to spatial analysis while introducing a series of common advanced techniques and nuanced methodological questions. Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.
  
Among others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.
  
The course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar.

URBS UN1515,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STUDIES,"This course is intended to be both an interdisciplinary introduction to the city and to the field of Urban Studies. As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field. Students in the course will approach cities from a number of disciplines, not only through the reading, but also through assignments that take place in different locations throughout New York City.",Andreina Torres Angarita,1:10pm,2:25pm,00420,,V1515-20261-001,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STU,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V1515-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261URBS1515V001,LECTURE

URBS UN2520,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN PLANNING,"This course is a basic introduction to the field and practice of urban planning in the United States. The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment.
  
The core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more “livable” cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice.
  
The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning.",Noah Allison,2:40pm,3:55pm,00422,,V2520-20261-001,INTRO TO URBAN PLANNING,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V2520-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20261URBS2520V001,LECTURE

Students will read both classic and contemporary ethnographies to gain an in-depth understanding of how cities are lived and experienced. The course also unsettles the category of Latin America, to introduce a discussion of the “Latinization” of U.S. cities. We will interrogate ethnographic and audiovisual materials (included to complement the readings) from a postcolonial perspective.  We will discuss the politics of knowledge production and representation in ethnographic studies and popular culture, the impact of colonialism in transnational flows of knowledge and labor, as well as the contributions to urban theory from the perspective of cities located in the Global South.",Andreina Torres Angarita,4:10pm,6:00pm,00423,,V3252-20261-001,URBAN LATINX AMERICA: ETH,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3252-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20261URBS3252V001,SEMINAR
URBS UN3310,"RACE. SPACE, URB SCHOOLS","Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools. And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools. This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.",Amelia S Herbert,2:10pm,4:00pm,00793,,V3310-20261-003,,Education @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3310-20261-003/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20261URBS3310V003,LECTURE
URBS UN3315,METROPOLITICS OF RACE & PLACE,"This class explores how racism and racialized capitalism and politics shape the distribution of material resources among cities and suburbs in metropolitan areas and the racial and ethnic groups residing in them. Readings and discussion focus on the history of metropolitan area expansion and economic development, as well as contemporary social processes shaping racial and ethnic groups’ access to high-quality public goods and private amenities. We address racial and ethnic groups’ evolving political agendas in today’s increasingly market-driven socio-political context, noting the roles of residents; federal, state, and local governments; market institutions and actors; urban planners, activist organizations, foundations, and social scientists, among others. Here is a sample of specific topics: race/ethnicity and who “belongs” in what “place;” inequitable government and market investment across racial and ethnic communities over time and “sedimentation effects” (for example, the “redlining” of Black communities leading to their inability to access loan and credit markets and the resulting wealth gap between Blacks and Whites); gentrification processes; creating sufficient, sustainable tax bases; and suburban sprawl. Assignments will include two short response papers, mid-term and final exams, and another project to be determined.",Angela Simms,2:40pm,3:55pm,00425,,V3315-20261-001,METROPOLITICS OF RACE & P,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3315-20261-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20261URBS3315V001,LECTURE

Informed by critical studies of the environment, we will address the broad question of why, for some, the environment is representational of a healthy lifestyle and source of prosperity, while for others it is a source of risk and harm. Our course of study invites students to critically analyze environmental justice case studies and to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among urban populations and the social, political, and economic processes that lead to environmental inequality. We will also explore how racism is foundational to environmental exploitation and consider why global struggles for racial justice are crucial for protecting both people and the earth. We will pay particular attention to how environmental health inequalities are linked to race, class, gender, and nation.

URSP IA7150,Seminar in Urban Politics and Policy,"All public policy occurs within a political context. The purpose of this seminar is to examine how politics impacts policy in America’s large cities. While we rely on case material from American cities, the theoretical frameworks, problems, and policy solutions we consider are relevant to understanding public policy in any global city.
  
Cities are not legal entities defined in the American Constitution. Yet, historically, they have developed a politics and policymaking process that at once seems archetypically American and strangely foreign. We will consider who has power in cities and how that impacts policy priorities; whether America’s traditional institutions of representation “work” for urban America; how the city functions within our federal system; and whether neighborhood democracy is a meaningful construct. We will also consider the impact of politics on urban policymaking. Can cities solve the myriad problems of their populations under existing institutional arrangements? How are cities being affected by the post-pandemic work-from-home economy? Do the economic and social factors that impact urban politics and policy limit a city’s capacity to find and implement solutions to urban problems? How has increasing income inequality and persistent racial discrimination impacted urban governance and policy making? Does political protest result in changes in urban policy? Finally, can urban politics be restructured to better address problems of inequity and racial justice.

Since the founding of the United States, political institutions have shaped evolving definitions of race, and racial inequality has remained a persistent feature of American society. As a result, race and politics remain inextricably linked.
  
The course examines how racial disparities—and efforts to address them—affect local, state, and national political dynamics. Drawing frequently on examples from New York City, students will analyze intergroup relations among Black, white, Latino, and Asian communities, as well as the causes and consequences of contemporary racial mobilization. The course will also address the influence of executive leadership, including the ongoing impact of the Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies on racial discourse and governance.
  
Students will begin with a historical overview of race as an organizing concept, then turn to contemporary themes such as inequality, governance, and the role of institutions in perpetuating or challenging systemic disparities. Topics include disenfranchisement, gentrification, civil rights, economic mobility, and spatial access.
  
The course engages a range of policy areas, including education, immigration, housing, health, elections, poverty, political representation, transportation, and criminal justice. These will be considered in relation to party politics, group identity, coalition building, and intergroup conflict, with attention to both change and continuity in the intersection of race and American public life.
  
Guiding questions include: What role does collective racial identity play in shaping policy demands? Should race-based policymaking continue at the local, national, or international level? What lessons can be drawn from coalition politics in New York City and beyond?

We will be learning to see color, and use paint in response to that. Painting is a way to account for, express and communicate what you have seen with your eyes, mind or in your imagination. You will be introduced to different approaches to the craft of painting, and will by the end of the semester be more free and confident in interpreting your inner and outer vision.

use
 color? These are the questions that will guide this foundational course designed for painters, ranging from beginner to advanced, who want to develop their technique and material thought process.
  
We will begin with a focus on color, using the Albers method to learn first from experience, developing an eye for color, before we delve into color theory and color philosophy. The creative eye for color will aid us as we learn the ins and outs of acrylic painting, oil painting, the mediums, historical techniques, and associated theoretical concerns in 
how
 something is painted. Some of the class will be spent painting observationally, working on our ability to see creatively and translate experience into material. Many of the projects will be self-directed in subject or approach, whether you consider yourself a staunch realist or pure abstract artist, focusing mostly on the material language of the painting.

VIAR AV8206,Graduate Seminar in Painting and Related,"APORETICS: Paintings without Painters and Painters without Paintings
  
This seminar will be organized around aporias. Starting with Plato's 
Meno
, aporia is used to describe a state of numbed confusion, exposing a gap in knowledge that can be leveraged to temporarily undermine certainty. Optimally, aporia is not merely confusion or resignation in the face of contradiction, but a state of affairs that makes a demand on us. These double binds, paradoxes, impasses, and blind spots will be our guides through a history of painting and treated as a lens to explore the contemporary desire to unknow what painting was or to ask what types of experience it attends to. Making painting impossible again, at least for our seminar, might be the only way for painting to pose questions of its more recent triumphalist mode, which seems to celebrate all that it knows of itself while potentially overworking its painters.
  
Readings from philosophy, art history, artists' writings, and critical theory will be worked through over the course of the seminar along with presentations on individual artists.

VIAR AV8313,Wayfinding in Crisis: Genealogies of Cli,"“Our violence towards the Earth springs from, and is modeled on, our violence towards other human beings.” — Amitav Ghosh in conversation with Lucia Pietroiusti, Guggenheim Museum, February 5, 2022
  
Many contemporary artists are trying to find sustainable and equitable ways of operating in a global economy hellbent on growth no matter the cost, including extinction. If, as Earth inhabitants in the Anthropocene, we are all contributing to the current climate crisis, we can also be among the millions of solutions needed. In this class, we will expand our climate awareness and process our climate grief by learning lessons from non-human entities, Indigenous teachings and traditions, and current legal actions and grassroots activism against extractivism and the legacies of conquest, imperialism, and settler colonialism. In hopes for a more livable earth, Ben Okri’s concept of “existential creativity,” Amitav Ghosh’s call for a return to animist storytelling, Four Arrows’ goal for mainstream education to adopt Indigenous worldviews, and recent art that proposes the possibility of a regenerative future will be our guides.
  
A variety of media and content will be covered including the work of Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Artists Commit, Richard Bell, Octavia Butler, Rachel Carson, Meehan Crist, Ben Davis, Torkwase Dyson, Extinction Rebellion, Carolyn Finney, Fridays for Future, Dina Gilio-Whitaker, Amitav Ghosh, Linda Goode Bryant, The Harrison Studio, Katharine Hayhoe, Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, Yun Ko-eun, Bill McKibben, Gustav Metzger, Timothy Morton, Darcia Narvaez, The Natural History Museum, Ben Okri, Lucia Pietroiusti, Kim Stanley Robinson, Mary Robinson, Astra Taylor, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Wahinkpe Topa (Four Arrows) aka Donald Trent Jacobs, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Elvia Wilk, Isabel Wilkerson, and Tyson Yunkaporta. Class guests and field trips will include artists and thinkers working on the precipice of climate education, action, healing, and justice.",,,,14151,,R8313-20261-001,Wayfinding in Crisis: Gen,Visual Arts,VIAR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/R8313-20261-001/,,In-Person,Schools of the Arts,3,,,20261VIAR8313R001,SEMINAR

is an advanced moving image class which centers on the use of both established and emergent digital technologies as a medium for exploration and artistic expression. The focus will be on artworks that reference the body/bodies in movement, the creation of Avatars and the designing of environments and spatial narratives. Existing works from this emergent area will be shown to give cultural and historical context, seen through a personal and political lens. The course will be intensive and hands-on, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills will be utilized to create works based on the individual or collective expression of the artist/s.
  
Students are encouraged to explore areas of personal interest and to incorporate this research
 into their production work. Taking an active role in class discussions and production teamwork is

How is its transformation attenuated when the body is in formation with other bodies, a breathing still life of people and props? This performance art course will use the question of a body’s stillness as a platform to create interdisciplinary projects that exist between dance, sculpture, collaborative movement, and performance art. Through core readings and case study presentations, we will discuss unique possibilities of representation and challenges this form enables, and the prominent role it has been taking within the visual arts in recent years. Students will engage with a variety of aesthetic strategies and formal techniques such as movement workshops, sensory exercises, video, wearable sculptures, collaboration, scores, and group meditation. Studio work will focus on concrete intersections between the body and the object, and case studies chosen to encourage students to think of movement as a form of resistance, and to consider the political implication of collaborative work that unfolds over time.

While building such common experiential platforms, the class will also build language for a dialogic space, through weekly in-class discussions lead by the instructor, guests, and rotating panels of the students. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from experiential learning to intensive studio work on a final project, where the students are asked to pay close attention to how various methods and fields of subjects combine. The resulting project has to be the best work you have ever done.

 affect by working with archival documents (such as zines, manifestos, and movement ephemera) and other primary sources (such as memoir, photography and documentary film).",Manijeh Moradian,2:10pm,4:00pm,00761,,X3138-20261-001,,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X3138-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20261WMST3138X001,SEMINAR

This course offers a special opportunity for students to engage with the Scholar and Feminist at a historic moment: in February 2026, BCRW will host the 50th conference. We will use the history of the Scholar and Feminist conference as a guide to trace the making of feminist knowledge over the past fifty years. In addition to reading about the scholarly context of the conference, students will do archival work in preparation for attending and analyzing the anniversary gathering. Students will engage with key feminist debates that have been part of the conference’s history. They will consider how conferences function as spaces of research production and movement-building, exploring how the lessons of past controversies and solidarities can inform feminist scholarship and action in the present. Readings will draw from BCRW’s 
Scholar & Feminist Online
 and the Barnard archives, alongside key theoretical feminist texts, to consider how movements, controversies, and institutional struggles have shaped the field. Together, we will ask: how has the conference created new possibilities for scholarship and activism, and why are these questions urgent in a moment when feminist knowledge and institutions are under attack?",Margot L Kotler,12:10pm,2:00pm,00917,,X3589-20261-001,Feminist Knowledge and Ac,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X3589-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,F,20261WMST3589X001,SEMINAR
WMST BC4325,EMBODIMENT AND BODILY DIFFERENCE,"At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersection of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures—including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies—to consider some of the ways in which the body is constituted by such discourses, and itself serves as the substratum for social relations. Among the key questions we will consider are the following: What is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between presumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic and somatic experiences?  How do historical and political-economic forces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference? And most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by competing logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance to these and other categorizations?",Rebecca Jordan-Young,2:10pm,4:00pm,00610,,X4325-20261-001,EMBODIMENT & BODILY DIFFE,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X4325-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20261WMST4325X001,SEMINAR
WMST GR8001,GRAD STUDENT & FACULTY COLLOQ,"This is a course is oriented to graduate students who are thinking about issues in teaching in the near and distant future and want to explore forms of pedagogy. The course will ask what it means to teach “as a feminist” and will explore how to create a classroom receptive to feminist and queer methodologies and theories regardless of course theme/content. Topics include: participatory pedagogy, the role of political engagement, the gender dynamics of the classroom, modes of critical thought and disagreement. Discussions will be oriented around student interest. The course will meet 4-5 times per SEMESTER (dates TBD) and the final assignment is to develop and workshop a syllabus for a new gender/sexuality course in your field.

WMST GU4210,BLACK GEOGRAPHIES,"Far from obvious renderings of place, maps are spatial arguments about who belongs where and how living should be defined. This course approaches place as something that is contested daily in the U.S. through the struggle of who gets to lay claim to a way of life. From the landscapes of dispossession to the alternative ways marginalized people work with and against traditional geographies, this course centers Black place-making practices as political struggle. This class will look at how power and domination become a landed project. We will critically examine how ideas about “nature” are bound up with notions of race, and the way “race” naturalizes the proper place for humans and non-human others. We will interrogate settler colonialism’s relationships to mapping who is and isn’t human, the transatlantic slave trade as a project of terraforming environments for capital, and land use as a science for determining who “owns” the earth. Centered on Black feminist, queer and trans thinkers, we will encounter space not as a something given by maps, but as a struggle over definitions of the human, geography, sovereignty, and alternative worlds. To this end, we will read from a variety of disciplines, such as Critical Black Studies, Feminist and Intersectional Science Studies, Black Geographies and Ecologies, Urban Studies and Afrofuturist literature. (Note: this class will count as an elective for the CCIS minors/concentrations in F/ISTS, ICORE/MORE, and Environmental Humanities.)",Marisa Solomon,2:10pm,4:00pm,00764,,W4210-20261-001,,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W4210-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20261WMST4210W001,SEMINAR

Texts will be analyzed in terms of genre structures, narrative strategies, the role of gender in shaping content and Jewish identity, and the political, cultural and social contexts in which the works were created. The course aims for students to discuss and critically engage with texts in order to develop the skills of analytical and abstract thinking, as well as the ability to express that critical thinking in writing.

We will focus on diverse Arab, Iranian, and Afghan diasporas in the United States, where 19th and 20th century legacies of racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and Orientalism combined in new ways to target these groups after the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Drawing on an interdisciplinary array of texts, including ethnography, fiction, feminist and queer theory, social movement theory, and visual and performance art, we will look at how the “war on terror” has shaped the subjectivities and self-representation of SWANA communities. Crucially, we will examine the gender and sexual politics of Islamophobia and racism and study how scholars, activists and artists have sought to intervene in dominant narratives of deviance, threat, and backwardness attributed to Muslim and other SWANA populations. This course takes up the politics of naming, situating the formation of “SWANA” as part of an anti-colonial genealogy that rejects imperial geographies such as “Middle East.” We will ask how new geographies and affiliations come into being in the context of open-ended war, and what new political identities and forms of cultural production then become possible.",Manijeh Moradian,10:10am,12:00pm,00766,,W4330-20261-001,SWANA Diasporas,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W4330-20261-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20261WMST4330W001,SEMINAR

 sexuality by illuminating historically specific and culturally distinct conditions in which
 these systems of power have operated. Beginning in the early modern period, the
 course seeks to destabilize contemporary notions of gender and sexuality and instead
 probe how race, sexuality, and gender have functioned as mechanisms of differentiation
 embedded in historically contingent processes. Moving from “Caliban to Comstock,”
 students will probe historical methods for investigating and critically evaluating claims
 about the past. In making these inquiries, the course will pay attention to the
 intersectional nature of race, gender, and sexuality and to strategic performances of
 identity by marginalized groups. This semester, we will engage research by historians
 of sexuality, gender, and capitalism to critically reflect on the relationship between

WRIT UN2311,TRADITIONS IN POETRY,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
“For those, in dark, who find their own way by the light of others’ eyes.” —Lucie Brock-Broido
  
The avenues of poetic tradition open to today’s poets are more numerous, more invigorating, and perhaps even more baffling than ever before. The routes we chose for our writing lead to destinations of our own making, and we take them at our own risk—necessarily so, as the pursuit of poetry asks each of us to light a pilgrim’s candle and follow it into the moors and lowlands, through wastes and prairies, crossing waters as we go. Go after the marshlights, the will-o-wisps who call to you in a voice you’ve longed for your whole life. These routes have been forged by those who came before you, but for that reason, none of them can hope to keep you on it entirely. You must take your steps away, brick by brick, heading confidently into the hinterland of your own distinct achievement.
  
 
  
For the purpose of this class, we will walk these roads together, examining the works of classic and contemporary exemplars of the craft. By companioning poets from a large spread of time, we will be able to more diversely immerse ourselves in what a poetic “tradition” truly means. We will read works by Edmund Spencer, Dante, and Goethe, the Romantics—especially Keats—Dickinson, who is mother to us all, Modernists, and the great sweep of contemporary poetry that is too vast to individuate.
  
 
  
While it is the imperative of this class to equip you with the knowledge necessary to advance in the field of poetry, this task shall be done in a Columbian manner. Consider this class an initiation, of sorts, into the vocabulary which distinguishes the writers who work under our flag, each of us bound by this language that must be passed on, and therefore changed, to you who inherit it. As I have learned the words, I have changed them, and I give them now to you so that you may pave your own way into your own ways, inspired with the first breath that brought you here, which may excite and—hopefully—frighten you. You must be troubled. This is essential",Ofi Davis,10:10am,12:00pm,12859,,W2311-20261-001,,Writing,WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W2311-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20261WRIT2311W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3010,SHORT PROSE FORMS,"Prerequisites: No Prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. Flash fiction, micro-naratives and the short-short have become exciting areas of exploration for contemporary writers. This course will examine how these literary fragments have captured the imagination of writers internationally and at home. The larger question the class seeks to answer, both on a collective and individual level, is: How can we craft a working definition of those elements endemic to short prose as a genre? Does the form exceed classification? What aspects of both crafts -- prose and poetry -- does this genre inhabit, expand upon, reinvent, reject, subvert? Short Prose Forms incorporates aspects of both literary seminar and the creative workshop. Class-time will be devoted alternatingly to examinations of published pieces and modified discussions of student work.

Well also explore the way in which these same techniques of writing allow us to personify entities that lack traditional personhood, such as animals, computers, and other nonhuman characters.

WRIT UN3134,BUILDING BETTER WORLDS,"As 20th century literary traditions prove increasingly ill-equipped to capture the realities of 21st century life, readers look towards fictional worlds for inspiration and escape from the political chaos of day-to-day existence. When we write we shape the world, because the worlds we imagine impact the world we inhabit. But what does it mean for a writer to 'build a world?' What obligations does the creator of a fiction have to readers who inhabit a world they wish to escape? Are the worlds we build for escape always political? Can we build another world as an avenue to better understand this one?
  
In this seminar we will explore the concept of ""world building"" by looking at a variety of work from authors who are known for their immense secondary worlds (such as J.R.R. Tolkein, Ursula K. Le Guin, N.K. Jemisin, or Octavia Butler) but also at fiction that applies techniques of both immersion and politics in ways that may subvert our understanding of what it means to 'create.' Writers discussed are as wide ranging as Toni Morrison, Angela Carter, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Margaret Atwood, Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Clive Barker, all the way up to contemporary writers whose works populate our best loved Independent bookstores: Helen Oyeyemi, Victor LaValle, Ted Chiang, Marlon James, Jeff VanderMeer, Colson Whitehead, Salman Rushdie, Carmen Maria Machado, Alexandra Kleeman, or Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah.",Molly L McGhee,4:10pm,6:00pm,12874,,W3134-20261-001,,Writing,WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3134-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20261WRIT3134W001,SEMINAR

We will read across the genres as we ask questions about these various nonfiction forms: Can criticism be the equal of art? How do nonfiction writers establish “authority”? How do they investigate the past and make sense of the new? How do they create work as rich and challenging as the best literary novels and short stories? What roles do voice, point-of-view, character, dialogue, and plot—the traditional elements of fiction—play? How did T
he New Yorker
 create a—perhaps even 
the
—modern American literary style?

WRIT UN3317,TRAUMA & ITS AFTERMATH: POETIC FORM(S) O,"“After a great pain, a formal feeling comes —"" 
  
—Emily Dickinson 
  
The history of literature has, in many ways, become inseparable from the history of trauma. Poetry can be an excavation site of memory and the subconscious dreamscape, and inevitably, trauma is what is unearthed there. Poems working with, through, and out of personal and collective trauma can create what Dorothea Lasky calls “the material imagination;” a shared world inhabited by both poet and reader long after the poem has been read—a physical space we are in together that helps us move through, process, and in the best of cases, rewrite trauma into the generative and healing space of metaphor and imagery. In this way, poems are—in both their content and their form (which are often are indivisible)—an invitation to the reader to access the depths and complexities of the human psyche that we are all connected by, perhaps in a way they might not have before. The poem creates a finite terrain that anchors infinite possibility. This class will study texts that stem from, speak to, document and process historical, ecological, collective and personal trauma. How can a poem hold, house, and reconfigure traumatic events for both reader and poet through its formal and thematic architecture?",Samantha Zighelboim,12:10pm,2:00pm,12880,,W3317-20261-001,TRAUMA & ITS AFTERMATH,Writing,WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3317-20261-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20261WRIT3317W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3328,LIVING AT THE MOVIES: THE PERSONA POEM I,"Inspired by the Jim Carroll book of the same name, this class will examine the persona poem form specifically through the lens of film and television, focusing on how style, atmosphere and character translate from visual media to poetry. We will examine and discuss persona poems based on movie/television characters, writing the self into movies/television, and writing movie/television characters into personal experience. We will generate ideas and/or drafts of our own, centering the following questions, among others:
  
How do you create, sustain, and complicate tone without sacrificing clarity? How does a character transcend space/time limits to evolve from a first introduction to a cherished and known persona in a constrained space, whether that constraint be a 90-minute film or a 16-line poem? Which tensions accelerate and/or stifle character development, and which tensions permit a persona the most accessible, familiar, or surprising presence for a reader? What differentiates movie stars or actors from literary protagonists? Why are movies “cool,” how has “cool” evolved in film, and how do we render “cool” in poems, for the purpose of deepening the poem? What separates sentimentality from earnestness in film versus poetry?
  
The class is structured as a hybrid seminar/workshop: we will spend our time in class discussing assigned texts, visual media, and the connections and divergences between the two, as well as crafting our own poetic responses and interpretations and sharing them in a workshop format. Source material will include poetry that is persona-based in perspective or subject, film and television prompts, and field trips to meaningful NYC literary and/or filmic landmarks.

WRIT UN3400,PAYING ATTENTION WITH ANNIE DILLARD,"Annie Dillard was only in her twenties when she began writing what would become the nature writing classic 
Pilgrim at Tinker Creek
, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975. Over several seasons, she took her notebook to the creek and paid close attention to the muskrats, water bugs, and birds, focusing on the miraculous minutiae of the material world, and compiled what Thoreau might have called “a meteorological journal of the mind.” With a child’s capacity for awe, Dillard captured what she found to be holy and singular about nature, and reveled in the “scandal of particularity” that so bedeviled theologians. “Why, we might as well ask, not a plane tree, instead of a bo?” Dillard wonders. “I never saw a tree that was no tree in particular.” Since its publication, 
Pilgrim
 has inspired generations of writers who return to it for its commitment to specificity and its joyous prose. What does the moon look like? Like “a smudge of chalk,” or “softly frayed, like the heel of a sock.” What do you call the shedding of leaves in fall? “A striptease.” What does cold air do? “Bites one’s nose like pepper.” (And so on.)
  
In this cross-genre seminar, we will read 
Pilgrim at Tinker Creek
 and use the book as a guiding text to hone our own faculties of attention, observational writing skills, and descriptive ability. We will work and rework our descriptions so that no tree is just a tree, and no sunset is just a sunset. The output of this course will not be stories, essays, or poems, but rather, lists of descriptions of oranges, the texture of bark, weather, and a repertoire of new vocabulary words for describing colors and materials. Weekly exercises will prompt us to become nature writers in the city: we will stalk pigeons, inventory trash and weeds, study maps of buried streams, and examine a drop of puddle water through a microscope. We will dissect Dillard’s prose to see how she puts her words together to achieve various effects. We will compile lists of active verbs and make our sentences somersault and sing. Though taking inspiration from 
Pilgrim
 and based in the natural world, the exercises in this class are meant to carry over into other kinds of writing; paying close attention is an asset no matter what the subject matter.

YIDD UN2102,INTERMEDIATE YIDDISH II,"Prerequisites: YIDD UN1101-UN1102 or the instructor's permission. This year-long course is a continuation of Elementary Yiddish II. As part of the New Media in Jewish Studies Collaborative, this class will be using new media in order to explore and research the fabulous world of Yiddish literature, language, and culture, and to engage in project-oriented activities that will result in creating lasting multi-media online presentations. In addition to expanding the command of the language that has been spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews for more than a millennium, i.e. focusing on developing speaking, reading, writing and listening skills, and on the acquisition of more advanced grammatical concepts, students will also get some video and film editing training, and tutorials on archival research. The class will continue to read works of Yiddish literature in the original and will venture outside of the classroom to explore the Yiddish world today: through exciting field trips to Yiddish theater, Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, YIVO, Yiddish Farm, and so on. And we will also have the Yiddish native-speaker guest series.
