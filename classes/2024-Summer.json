The main objective of the course is to equip you with the knowledge to understand, evaluate, and act upon the many financial and non-financial reports used in managing modern firms.\n Managing any modern firm requires information about the firm\u2019s products, processes, assets, and customers. This information is a key input into a wide range of decisions: analyzing profitability of various products, managing product-line portfolios, setting prices, measuring and managing profitability of customers, making operational and strategic decisions, evaluating investments, guiding improvement efforts, and so on.\n The focus of this course is on modern internal-reporting systems. We will discover that many firms do not provide their managers with useful information; we will see numerous examples of value destruction and bankruptcies caused by this. We will also investigate some modern ideas in how an organization\u2019s internal information system should be designed to enhance value creation; and we will see how world-class firms take advantage of their competitors\u2019 internal-reporting mistakes.\n To attain the right level of understanding, we will briefly explore the mechanics of the many techniques used to prepare internal reports. But the emphasis in this course is very much on interpretation, evaluation, and decision-making.\n \n We will examine the following key topics:\n ? Designing managerial information systems to support an organization\u2019s strategy.\n ? Determining which financial and non-financial metrics are necessary for success in various competitive environments.\n ? Evaluating profitability of products, services, assets, and customers.\n ? The capabilities and the limitations of various reporting systems in guiding value-maximization, cost-control, and improvement efforts.\n ? The limitations of traditional cost-estimation systems.\n ? Activity-based costing and activity-based management.\n ? Estimating and managing the costs of capacity resources.\n ? Relevant costs and relevant revenues in business decisions.\n ? The information necessary to evaluate long-term business decisions.\n ? The incentives created by various performance-evaluation techniques.",

    "course_descr":"The purpose of this course is to learn about fundamental drivers of value and risk by analyzing financial statements of businesses in different industries. Every public company provides a lot of financial and operational information in its filings. How can this information be used to evaluate its prospects and its risks?\nThe course is organized around two themes (1) how to identify relevant information in the financial information reported by firms, and (2) how to draw inferences using sound analytical methodology. To this end, we will review techniques for valuation and risk analysis used by banks and asset management firms. The valuation models you will study in this course are all fundamental models \u2013 models that use\nfinancial information and review the fundamental operating characteristics of the company. We will learn to build simple financial models, perform risk analysis and fine tune value drivers. Much of the data comes from the financial statements \u2013 but it requires a careful study of arcane footnotes to unearth the information provided by the companies. This is an advanced course that goes into the details of footnote analysis, accounting rules, and financial presentations. This course builds on what you learned in Financial Accounting and Corporate Finance. These courses are pre-requisites for taking this course. It is assumed that you have already taken these courses. If you have not taken these courses you should first talk with me before you register. This course will build significantly on your knowledge from those courses. If your basics are solid and you are interested in learning to read financial statements; if you wish to learn to apply financial analysis; this course is for you. We will use excel to build some of the models \u2013 but this is not a course in excel. But, it is highly recommended that\nyou have a good working knowledge of how to build formulas in excel before you come to this class.\nBy the end of the course, you should be able to perform a thorough, credible investment or credit analysis that meets a high standard. Students should have the ability to estimate fundamental values, and pull apart the information in the financial statements to get relevant information. This course should be of interest to those contemplating careers in investment banking, security analysis, private\nequity, hedge funds, and corporate finance.",

The framework consists of the following steps:\n1. Understand the firm\u2019s strategy. We will assess the firm\u2019s value proposition and identify its key value drivers and risks.\n2. Accounting Analysis. We will assess earnings quality and evaluate whether the firm's accounting policies capture the underlying business reality. If not, we will adjust the accounting to eliminate GAAP issues and management biases.\n3. Financial Analysis. We will evaluate current performance with accounting data and financial ratios.\n4. Prospective Analysis: Forecasting. We will assess whether current firm performance is sustainable, and we will forecast future performance. In our forecasts, we will consider growth, profitability, and future competitive advantage.\n5. Prospective Analysis: Valuation. We will convert our forecasts of future earnings and book values into an estimate of the firm\u2019s current value. \nIn the second half of the course, we will apply the above framework to a variety of business valuation contexts, including IPOs, mergers, and equity-investment analyses.",

Alongside Gothic Revival churches, skyscrapers, campuses, and parks, this course will consider other forms of medieval architectural revivalism (including Moorish Revival synagogues and Romanesque Revival rowhouses) as well as projects that physically relocated medieval buildings to New York City both for private collections and public display. We will combine regular field trips to sites around the city with readings and discussions and will make use of the archives of several prominent revivalist architects in Avery Library\u2019s collections.",

The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.\u00a0 With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",

It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts. Reading primary sources from the period under examination is a crucial part of the course.",

The perspective will be primarily anthropological, although special attention will be paid to historical processes associated with colonialism and nation-building that are crucial to understanding present gender politics. We will focus on the sexual politics of everyday life in specific locales and explore the extent to which these are shaped by these histories and the power of representations mobilized in a global world in the present and international political interventions. In addition to reading ethnographic works about particular communities, we read memoirs and critical analyses of the local and transnational activist movements that have emerged to address various aspects of gender politics and rights.",

Sophisticated statistical and algorithmic methodologies, generally known as data science, are now of predominant interest and focus. Yet, the underlying cloud computing platform is fundamental to the enablement of data management and analytics.\n \n This course introduces students to cloud computing concepts and practices ranging from infrastructure and administration to services and applications. The course is primarily focused on the development of practical skills in utilizing cloud services to build distributed and scalable analytics applications. Students will have hands-on exposure to VMs (Virtual Machines), databases, storage, microservices, and AI\/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) services through Google Cloud Platform, et al.\u00a0 Cost and performance characteristics of alternative approaches will also be studied. Topics include: overview of cloud computing, cloud systems, parallel processing in the cloud, distributed storage systems, virtualization, security in the cloud, and multicore operating systems. Throughout, students will study state-of-the-art solutions for cloud computing developed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM.\n \n The course modules provide a blend of lecture and reading materials along with class exercises and programming assignments. While extensive programming experience is not required, students taking the course are expected to possess basic Python 3 programming skills.\n \n The desired outcome of the course is the student\u2019s ability to put conceptual knowledge to practical use. Whether you are taking this course for future academic research, for work in industry, or for an innovative startup idea, this course should help you master the fundamentals of cloud computing.",

    "course_descr":"This course is designed to afford students significant opportunity to explore fundamental bioethical issues in a philosophically searching way. For example, it is generally thought that health matters. But then what is health? And how does it matter? What is justice in respect to health-care and the other social determinants of health? Do competing theories of justice (e.g., liberal, libertarian, utilitarian) offer incompatible solutions to the question of healthcare justice? Or can a workable \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d at the public policy level nevertheless be achieved?\n  \nShould a healthcare professional be permitted, on grounds of conscience, to refuse to provide a healthcare service to which people are lawfully permitted? Indeed, what should count as \u201cconscience\u201d? In the aftermath of the recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, some have argued for a right to conscientiously insist on providing reproductive services that have been legally prohibited. How are we to sort through and resolve this complicated set of issues?\n  \nCould a meaningful personal understanding of what it means for someone to have died nevertheless not be suitable as the basis for a legal declaration of death? Why not? Should there be a \u201cconscience clause\u201d option whereby someone can specify in advance the conception of death to be applied in that individual\u2019s own case? Would every possible criterion be available or would certain criteria have to be excluded? Which? Why?\n  \nThe population in this and many other societies is aging and putting increasingly significant demands on the healthcare delivery system. Should healthcare be rationed according to age?\u00a0 Would it be unfair to young people not to give weight to that factor\u2014lest they lose out on a fair chance to live as long as society\u2019s seniors already have? What is healthcare justice across the generations?\n  \nAs researchers gain a fuller understanding of the aging process, it may soon be possible to genetically engineer a significant extension (even doubling?) of human life-span. Is this an appropriate objective for healthcare science to be pursuing?\u00a0 Is the point of healthcare to extend human life as far as possible by whatever means? Is aging a kind of \u201cdisease\u201d in its own right? Would life so dramatically extended be beneficial or burdensome?\n  \nThe topics for this course have been selected in view of (i) how fundamental they are to bioethical thinking (e.g., What is health?",

This course offers a comprehensive primer for those without any prior technical knowledge on the aforementioned subject matters, with a special focus on theory and practice and covering introductory- to intermediate-level content coverage. We will start by covering the basics and fundamental building blocks of the technological developments and innovations that made distributed systems and digital currencies such as blockchain and Bitcoin, respectively, possible. We will ultimately end the course on more complex topics and the latest research in the field, including the fundamental challenges to our existing economics and financial frameworks and the incumbent firms as well as potential solutions to such matters.

Business leaders are expected to lead diverse teams and support DEI, yet little formal education is provided to leaders in the field on the subject. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Foundations addresses this gap by introducing the fundamental concepts, frameworks, and theories that inform how we as leaders make meaning of diversity, equity, and inclusion personally and professionally. This course is an excellent opportunity for those interested in developing their ability to; understand and engage in conversations about diversity and inclusion; develop the ability to speak to the role DEI will play in their professional career; explore how their own identities relate to various systems of power, inclusion, and exclusion and contribute to building a more equitable workplace. Engaging with DEI is no longer a choice -- it is imperative. By the end of this course, students will have a working knowledge of the fundamental aspects of DEI and the tools required to engage in this work.",

Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of \u201ctruth\u201d in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.\n  \nAppropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

    "course_descr":"This course explores contemporary human rights issues in fiction, nonfiction, and film from Africa, Latin America, South Asia, the Caribbean, and the U.S., as well as humanitarian-inspired art, documentaries, television, and music circulated around the world. When decolonial and indigenous writers and cultural workers decide to represent violence in their countries, they risk reproducing racist stereotypes that permeate international media. And yet, human rights violations tied to war, slavery, sexual violence, religious fundamentalism, and ethnic strife are central features of turbulent national histories\u2014including our own in America. How can twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers from the Global South and beyond undermine the harmful stereotypes and dominant narratives that predetermine their stories in the international public sphere without reproducing stereotypes? To better understand strife abroad, we will take an interdisciplinary feminist approach to the politics of representing human rights. Our readings, paired with options for extracurricular events like film screenings in New York City, will prompt us to reflect critically on the ambivalences surrounding human rights in global culture. We will engage literary representations of historical events ranging from the Holocaust to the Vietnam War and the Rwandan genocide, all the way up to extremism in our present moment. Final projects invite students to reflect on methods for representing human rights through creative writing. This course, which fulfills the University Global Core requirement, as well as English major requirements for prose fiction\/narrative and comparative\/global literature, will appeal to students of not only literature but also in human rights, history, political science, African studies, law, and gender and sexuality studies.",

    "course_descr":"Extreme climate and weather events can lead to cascading failures that can spread within and across socio-environmental systems and sectors, often disproportionally affecting underserved communities. Climate change is projected to lead to more frequent and more severe extreme weather events amplifying the likelihood of Complex Climate Risks through multivariate, concurrent and sequential climate extremes affecting societal systems (e.g., food, health, supply chains, finance) and critical infrastructure (e.g., water, energy, communication, transportation) in complicated ways that are challenging to anticipate and prepare for. Understanding and mitigating Complex Climate Risks in a changing climate in compliance with climate equity and justice requires joint efforts from a broad range of scientific communities across disciplines and temporal and spatial scales - from local to global extent, synoptic to decadal variability, and hazard characterization to detailed risk and impact assessment. In recognition that univariate risk assessments might fail to acknowledge amplified risks for societies, from inter-related hazards and affected sectors, a complex risk perspective is increasingly required in the context of understanding climate impacts, resilience and adaptation.\n \n This course will provide an introduction to Complex Climate Risks by discussing recent frameworks developed to address them under current and future climate conditions. Several recent real-world eventsin which societal impacts were amplified by compounding climatic drivers and interactions with societal systems, leading to e.g. conflicts and migration, amplified mortality and failure of critical infrastructures are reviewed. Examples include the 2010 heatwave which caused increased mortality and harvest failures and their connection to the Arab Spring uprising a year later, the links of a year long with the Syrian Civil and the mass migration that followed in 2015 and the 2021 February Texas cold-spell that left millions without electricity and water for days under severe cold conditions in particular in poorer neighbourhoods. This course will provide the students with a thorough understanding of Complex Climate Risks, the typology of different compounding hazards and statistical approaches bridging the physical and societal spheres for a more integral climate risk assessment.\n \n Guided by recent literature quantitative and qualitative frameworks that aim at assessing current and future climate risks to turn them into actionable informa",

    "course_title":"Building Equitable Community Partnership",
    "course_descr":"Disaster management is a continuum that is affected by decisions, investments and dynamics that occur before, during and after disasters. The issue of equity in disaster management is emerging from an abundance of evidence that shows that societal inequities often translate into inequitable outcomes and disproportionate impacts from disasters. Community engagement strategies are often touted as a solution to the inequities, but many aspects of community participation are complex, with additional\n effort and investments required for working with vulnerable and marginalized communities. Further, power dynamics between disaster experts and vulnerable communities may bias approaches to disaster management as well as representation within relevant power structures. This seminar is designed to provide an introduction to some of the variables that impact vulnerability and inequity in disaster management, ultimately leading to inequitable outcomes. It also provides an overview of current and emerging strategies in community engagement designed to foster a \u201cwhole of community\u201d approach to disaster management.\n \n The purpose of this course is to prepare those entering the climate policy and practice workforce for addressing these challenges by providing an overview of issues of equity and building community partnerships in disaster management. At the end of this course learners will be able to:\n  \n  \nDescribe social determinants of disaster vulnerability and resilience\n  \nDescribe how governance and financial structures can drive inequity in the disaster cycle\n  \nIdentify whole community approaches for disaster management\n  \nIdentify mechanisms to develop partnerships with underserved communities and emergent partners in disaster management\n  \nDemonstrate the ability to develop strategies for disaster management based on best practices for community engagement and addressing equity concerns.",

Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the\n contributions of the Jews to their so called \u201chost cultures\u201d by way of diverse media\u2014literary and non-fictional\n works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end\n of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been\n intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.\n \n All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages\n is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to\n consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request.

Countertechnique\u00ae is a system of movement designed for dancers to practice self-direction and to cultivate availability to movement while learning to take risks. Developed over the past 25 years by Dutch choreographer, Anouk Van Dijk, the technique utilizes a task-based approach for body and mind as the vehicle to approach dance. It is a movement system that helps the dancer think with the dancing body by focusing on the process of incorporating anatomical information into action; and beginning to direct and counter-direct the body through space as an alternative to gripping or falling over. Dancers are encouraged to be proactive in discovering connections and solutions, to be less concerned with judging themselves, and to work in a healthy way physically, mentally, and emotionally. The priority is to experience clarity and enjoyment of movement while utilizing the Countertechnique\u00ae principles. \u263a www.countertechnique.com By the end of the semester, students will have a clarified relationship to space; a developed coordination and articulation of the body; they will gain knowledge about the anatomy of the body especially joint structure, location, and range; and will be able to begin Scanning \u2013 the ability to observe one\u2019s own state-of-being and draw upon solutions according to need and\/or experimentation.",

The focus is on generating managerially useful information and practical decision-making tools, rather than on statistical theory per se. A number of actual business cases are studied.\nConcepts covered are multiple linear regression models and the computer-assisted methods for building them, including stepwise regression and all subsets regression. Emphasis is placed on diagnostic and graphical methods for testing the validity and reliability of regression models.\nCourse topics include a review of basic statistical ideas, numerical and graphical methods for summarizing data, simple linear and nonlinear regression, multiple regression, qualitative independent and dependent variables, diagnostic methods for assessing the validity of statistical models. The course studies applications of regression to business forecasting and also examines alternative times series forecasting models, including exponential smoothing.\nWhile the primary focus of the course is on regression models, some other statistical models will be studied as well, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, analysis of variance, and goodness-of-fit tests.\nTerm project: A major aspect of course is the opportunity to carry out a practical statistical analysis project of one\u2019s own. Students work in teams on a problem of their own choosing. The goal of the project is to develop a useful statistical model for a specific business problem, with the professor providing ongoing guidance and advice during the course of project. The teams will give an oral presentation of their results at the term\u2019s end. \nExcel is used for basic statistical analysis as well as for developing straightforward regression models. In addition, more advanced commercial statistical software, such as Minitab or SAS, is used to carry out more complex and advanced analyses. In addition to the term project, there will be several computer-based assignments.",

    "course_title":"Operations Strategy",
    "course_descr":"A firm's operations encompass all the activities that are performed in order to produce and deliver a product or a service. An operations strategy refers to a set of operational decisions that a firm makes to achieve a long-term competitive advantage. These decisions may be about the firms facilities, its technology\/process choices, its relationships with both upstream and downstream business partners etc. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of how and why operational decisions are integral to a firms success. The course builds on concepts from the core Operations Management course and the core Strategy Formulation course. It is highly relevant to anyone whose work requires the strategic analysis of a firms operations, including those interested in consulting, entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, investment analysis, and general management. The course consists of four modules. The first module, Strategic Alignment,\" explores the question of how a firms operations should be structured so as to be consistent with the firms chosen way to compete. The second module, \"Firm Boundaries,\" considers the question of what operational activities should remain in house and what should be done by a business partner and the long-term implications of these decisions on competitive advantage. This module also addresses the issue of managing the business relationships with supply chain partners. The third module, \"Internal Operations,\" considers key decision categories in operations, e.g., capacity decisions, process choices, IT implementation, and managing networks, and shows how these decisions can lead to distinctive capabilities. The final module, \"New Challenges,\" is set aside to address new topics that reflect the current trends in the business environment.\"",

    "course_descr":"Sports analytics refers to the use of data and quantitative methods to measure performance and make decisions to gain advantage in the competitive sports arena. This course builds on the Business Analytics core course and is designed to help students to develop and apply analytical skills that are useful in business, using sports as the application area. These skills include critical thinking, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, game theory, optimization and simulation. These skills will be applied to sports in this course, but are equally useful in many areas of business.There will be three main topics in the course: (1) measuring and predicting player and team performance, (2) decision-making and strategy in sports, and (3) fantasy sports and sports betting. Typical questions addressed in sports analytics include: How to rank players or teams? How to predict future performance of players or teams? How much is a player on a team worth? How likely are extreme performances, i.e., streaks? Are there hot-hands in sports performances? Which decision is more likely to lead to a win (e.g., attempt a stolen base or not in baseball, punt or go for it on fourth down in football, dump and chase or not in hockey, pull the goalie or not in hockey)? How to form lineups in daily fantasy sports? How to manage money in sports betting? How to analyze various ``prop'' bets?The main sports discussed in the course will be baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and golf. Soccer, tennis, and other sports will be briefly discussed. \nStudents are welcome to pursue any sport in more detail (e.g., cricket, rugby, auto racing, horse racing, Australian rules football, skiiing, track and field, or even card games such as blackjack, poker, etc.) in a project. Class sessions will involve a mixture of current events, lecture, discussion, and hands-on analysis with computers in class. Each session will typically address a question from a sport using an important analytical idea (e.g., mean reversion) together with a mathematical technique (e.g., regression). Because of the \"laboratory\" nature of part of the sessions, students should bring their laptops to each class.",

For millennia, female spirituality\n and female sexuality have been paired in ways that reveal deep-seated anxieties about the female\n body and its power. From ancient Mesopotamian goddess worship to the frenzied witch hunts of\n early modern Europe to the child-devouring crones of folk tales from cultures around the world,\n we\u2019ll delve into what the witch and those who name and pursue her reveal about deeply-held cultural\n beliefs, desires, and anxieties. We\u2019ll work together to analyze the figure of the witch across time and\n space and develop our own ideas about why she is so constantly compelling. We\u2019ll also look at our\n own sociocultural moment and connect what we learn about witches to the world around us.",

How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, \u201cWhat do I know?,\u201d and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, George Orwell, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",

How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.

This course brings acting theory and practical acting exercises into the English literature classroom as tools to aid in analyzing modern drama. Because innovations in playwriting and acting often have arisen in tandem, the semester will take us on a tour of landmark 20th-century plays and developments in western theatre history. We will spend the beginning of each class session (around thirty minutes) on-our-feet, experimenting with a performance exercise from the week\u2019s acting readings. We will then devote the remainder of each class session to a roundtable seminar discussion about the week\u2019s play.\n  \nIn addition to offering a new methodology for close-reading and enlivening new avenues of interpretation, acting\u2019s traditional focus on the \u201ccharacter\u201d or \u201crole\u201d will raise large questions about the human: What are the nature and limits of identification and empathy? Which acting styles encourage practitioners to seek something universal in human emotion or experience? Conversely, which propose to investigate the historical and cultural specificity of human behavior? Can the process of constructing a character shed light on the social construction of gender, race, and disability? How do these plays, from different decades and regions, represent changing conceptions of these social categories? Are some acting styles inherently political or more political than others? Each student will engage these questions in an embodied as well as a theoretical way by rehearsing a monologue or scene and performing it in-class. However, no performance experience is required to enroll in this course, and students will not be graded on their acting abilities.",

In addition to the explicit echoes between these books, each work is interested in the relationship between the natural world and human beings; gender difference, relations between the sexes, and the reproduction of human life; and the bases of, and threats to, an ideal society. By reading these three works of art in sequence, we will thus look at how authors engage similar issues in different ways, paying particular attention to the role of history, nation, genre, politics, literary tradition, and authorial identity. Finally, we will consider the ways in which authors\u2019 revising, refuting, and re-envisioning of \u201csource\u201d texts affects our readings of the \u201csource\u201d texts as much as the new.",

    "course_descr":"\u201cLearned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.\u201d\u2015 Michel de Montaigne \u201cThere is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.\u201d Annie Dillard, The Writing Life \u201cFind a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, \u201cWhat do I know?,\u201d and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",

In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: \u201cWhat does a woman want?\u201d",

    "course_descr":"The turn-of-the-century United States was a nation on the cusp of a number of momentous social, cultural, and political movements. One of the biggest changes was in the status and role of women. From the emergence of the New Woman in the last decade of the 19th century, to the suffragette in the 1910s and the flapper in the 1920s, the roles and positions of women were expanding and evolving in unprecedented ways. Coupled with the growth and expansion of cities, women\u2019s mobility and the spaces they occupied changed dramatically during this time period. In this course, we will examine texts that depict the situation of women and their mobility in various social and cultural contexts in the shifting urban landscape of early twentieth-century New York City. What spaces were women allowed\/expected to occupy? What spaces were considered taboo or off limits? What were the effects and consequences of the spaces that women occupied? How did women\u2019s mobility differ to men\u2019s? How do race and class impact mobility and space? What factors influenced women\u2019s mobility and how did these factors change\/develop over time? Course materials will likely include work by Nella Larsen, Djuna Barnes, Sui Sin Far, Anzia Yezierska, Edith Wharton, and Faith Baldwin, as well as the film Skyscraper Souls",

The discipline covers the full range of disease occurrence, including genetic and environmental causes for both infectious and noninfectious diseases.  Increasingly, epidemiologists view causation in the broadest sense, as extending from molecular factors at the one extreme, to social and cultural determinants at the other.  This course introduces students to the theory, methods, and body of knowledge of epidemiology.  Principles of Epidemiology is designed for students in all fields of public health.

Topics include sample size calculations, clustered data, interrupted time series analysis, multilevel modeling, and longitudinal data analysis techniques. The course will take place over six 3.5-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods covered which will be followed by a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises implementing the analytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Course assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizzes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis and present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset). Each student must have a full-version of SAS installed (SAS University and SAS OnDemand will not be sufficient for this course) and SAS experience is strongly preferred.",

    "course_title":"SUPERHERO MOVIES AND NEW YORK",
    "course_descr":"In \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n, plumes of dust fill the New York City streets as the monster Bowser attacks the city. Mario, seemingly beaten, hides in a pizzeria. What inspires him to keep fighting? He sees himself in a TV ad for his plumbing business, wearing a superhero cape and flying next to the Freedom Tower. He finds solace in the representation of himself as a superhero and in a city that refused to concede that the game was over after 9\/11. Such a scene is emblematic of a seminar that will explore the superhero\u2019s relationship to the city\u2019s history and its traumas. Our eye will move between Hollywood blockbusters and global art cinema to help us mull how the superhero exemplifies, for some, the excesses of the U.S. during the global War on Terror. We will see Batman\u2019s alter-ego Bruce Wayne run towards what looks like an imploding World Trade Center on 9\/11 (\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n) and witness the superhero framed as an ideological smokescreen for the callous administration of George W. Bush who used the attacks to justify an endless war (\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown\n).\n  \nWhile strongly focused on the post-9\/11 superhero and its links to New York City, the cross-media seminar will track the superhero\u2019s initial rise in popularity during the trauma of World War II. It will mobilize the archival resources of Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library collections around the papers of noted \nX-Men \nwriter Chris Claremont, so students can read how the artist conceived of bringing histories around the Holocaust into his spectacular stories. Such dips into the archives will help us assess how such empowered figures offer surprising routes of representation for the disenfranchised. We will also consider the authoritarian possibilities of the vigilante Batman, situating Frank Miller\u2019s \nThe Dark Knight Returns\n against a cultural study that draws links between the comic and Bernhard Goetz who killed four black teenagers in a Manhattan subway in 1984. To further frame how the superhero serves as a potent means of socio-political critique, acclaimed artists and writers will be invited into the classroom. These include Paul Pope whose \nBatman: Year 100\n (2006) presents a dystopian superhero that allegorizes the oppressive aspects of the War on Terror\u2019s surveillance regime. A culminating field trip to the National September 11 Memorial Museum will be organized. There, students will visit \u201cThe World Trade Center",

But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading\/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms. The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums. The course will culminate in a final presentation where students will adapt an existing intellectual property, preferably a film or TV show, into a video game (or vice versa), justifying their creative choices.",

At the conclusion of the course, the student will have gained an appreciation for the role M&A plays on today's corporate landscape and have formed an opinion as to whether or not an M&A transaction makes sense\" for the firm. The student should expect at the conclusion of this course to have gained a level of competency in M&A commensurate with an entry-level investment banking associate in M&A. Whether or not the student \"practices\" M&A, the course will afford the student with an insider's look into what is an undeniable major force on today's corporate landscape. Accordingly, students who are interested in investment banking, consulting, equity research, corporate development, corporate lending, strategic planning, private equity, leveraged finance, or proprietary trading many wish to consider this course.\"",

Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",

Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as \u201cLatinas\/os\u201d \u201cHispanics\u201d or \u201cLatinxs\u201d today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina\/o\/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and \u201cnewcomers\u201d to American society. This course aims to place Latina\/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:\u00a0 Who are Latinas\/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?\u00a0 Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?\u00a0 The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.\u00a0 Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.\u00a0 The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups\u2014Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student\u2019s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the\u00a0\nGlobal Core\n\u00a0requirement, which is reflected on the\u00a0Columbia online registry.\u00a0\u00a0The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits.

It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current \u2018memory wars\u2019 in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa. Group(s): B, C Field(s): AFR, MEU",

We will pursue three lines of questioning. The first critically explores how central political concepts of the international state system\u2014sovereignty, property, territory, self-determination\u2014entwine the histories of settler colonialism and human rights. The second charts the rise and mechanisms of the international Indigenous rights movement, in particular its activity at the United Nations leading to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, and its contributions to ongoing debates on environmental and climate justice, group rights, natural resources and territorial autonomy, and cultural rights. The third unit interrogates settler state responses to the movement for Indigenous human rights, such as cooptation, recognition, and apology.\n  \nThrough readings drawn from history, ethnography, political and critical theory, international relations, Native studies, law, and documents produced by intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, we will explore and deepen the tensions between human rights as a theory and practice and the political lives and aspirations of Indigenous peoples and activists. What technologies of rule\u2014such as residential school systems and property law\u2014do settler colonial states deploy to dispossess Indigenous peoples? How have Indigenous peoples used the international human rights regime to mobilize against such dispossession? How have these states resisted the global Indigenous rights movement? And can the human rights regime, rooted in the international state system, meaningfully contribute to anticolonial movements in liberal settler colonies? While we will touch on settler colonialism as it manifests around the globe\u2014including in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Israel\u2014the course\u2019s geographical focus will be on North America.\n  \nCourse objectives\n  \nThroughout this course, you will:\n  \n  \nDevelop a historically-informed understanding of both international indigenous rights and settler colonialism as idea, practice, institution, and discourse;\n  \nPlace the literature on human rights and settler colonialism into critical conversation in order to deepen existing conceptual problems and generate new ones;\n  \nIdentify the main a",

Although not a history of Western music, the course is taught in a chronological format and includes masterpieces by Josquin des Prez, Monteverdi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Verdi, Wagner, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, among others. No previous knowledge of music required. Columbia University undergraduates who need this course for graduation are encouraged to register during early registration.",

The course is designed to provide a deep understanding of the typical challenges, opportunities,\u00a0 phases, and methods for conducting a successful consulting assignment for knowledge-based organizations. A\u00a0 typical strategic consulting assignment includes the following phases: organization assessment, sponsor\/client\u00a0 relationship, gathering data, diagnosis issues, implementation, and measurement. Drawing on examples from a\u00a0 variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies for building a successful knowledge service or\u00a0 product for organizations or institutions. We will provide knowledge of foundational frameworks and theories and\u00a0 the need for tailored approaches for different clients. Students will get hands-on experience diagnosing and\u00a0 proposing knowledge strategies for improving organizational effectiveness and competitiveness.\n  \nSuccessful consulting, whether internal or external, requires many capabilities and, at heart, is dependent on the\u00a0 client-consultant relationship. Students will be engaged in working on a simulated consulting assignment based on\u00a0 the current organization in which they work. Alternatively, students may discuss with the faculty to be assigned to\u00a0 work with a voluntary organization seeking student input. During the term, each student will complete individual\u00a0 and team assignments that build on the deliverables needed for an actual consulting assignment. By developing\u00a0 expertise in strategic leadership consulting, students will gain credibility, competence, and confidence in their ability\u00a0 to communicate, design, develop, and provide knowledge and change services to an organization and society.\u00a0 During the semester, students will learn strategies for building knowledge services, including the models, methods,\u00a0 processes, and social factors that promote successful change.\n  \nThis course is designed for students who are or will be working in positions that require internal or external\u00a0 organizational consulting skills or in positions that require managing organizational change initiatives.

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

We explore the role of American political culture, the presidency, Congress, and the foreign policy bureaucracy in helping to determine America's relationship with other states and international organizations. We pay particular attention to the recurring tensions that run through American foreign policy: isolationism v. internationalism, security v. prosperity, diplomacy v. military power, unilateralism v. multilateralism, and realism v. idealism. Each week we will explore a broad theoretical\/conceptual theme and then focus on a specific topic that exemplifies a practical application of the theme.",

    "course_descr":"Special Operations are typically defined as national security actions in hostile, denied, or sensitive environments, and often require covert, clandestine, or low-visibility approaches. From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication. Major themes of study will be: national security fundamentals; concepts of war, conflict, and special operations; and the use of special operations forces over time.",

As part of the MPA in Global Leadership Summer Program, the Economics and Quantitative Bootcamp will help students revive and sharpen their skill set to better use information on current economic trends, socioeconomic indicators, and policy evaluations and trade-offs. Addressing global policy challenges implies using evidence to move solutions forward.\u00a0The four-week Bootcamp will help students make projections using mathematical models and make judgments or estimates using data through statistics. It will also cover basic economic concepts and frameworks of microeconomics and macroeconomics to allow students to successfully apply them in the analysis of public policy. Throughout the course, the Bootcamp will exemplify the concepts with relevant real-world cases.",

    "course_descr":"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdifferent.\u201d The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the \u201cGlobal Core.\u201d The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world\u2014where the false binaries of \u201cthe West\u201d and \u201cthe Rest\u201d no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",

We examine the forces that have underpinned\n migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions\n in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an\n object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a \u2018total social fact\u2019 involving political,\n social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres\n and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with\n questions about the relationship between lived experience and representation and between\n politics and the arts.\n  \nTo enroll in\u00a0this course through the \nColumbia Summer in Paris\n program, you must apply to the through the Center for\u00a0Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).\n \nGlobal Learning Scholarships \navailable. \nTuition\n charges apply.\n  \nPlease note the program dates\u00a0are different from the Summer Term A & B\u00a0dates",

This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict. \nPrerequisite: NECR 5105 Introduction to Negotiation\n.",

We added the lens of social-psychological concepts and practices to better understand how to apply DST to conflict. We are now applying DST to conflict analysis and resolution for larger social problems and conflicts that are protracted, deeply embedded and have multiple complex issues. This DST approach goes beyond linear problem-solving and embraces complexity in new ways. Dynamical Systems and Conflict Resolution (NECR 5210) is a required 3-credit course in the Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Program (NECR). Students are expected to spend on average 20 hours per week on this course, including media, group work, readings, and other assignments. NECR 5210 builds on concepts from Understanding Conflict and Cooperation (NECR 5101), where students became familiar with conflict resolution frames, theories, and models, as well as a basic understanding of the DST approach. This course will further develop and advance student understanding and use of advanced DST concepts and tools that will be useful for scholar-practitioners facing situations that require a systemic approach for more highly complex conflicts. It is a complementary approach that rounds out the other concepts and skills student learn in the program. Throughout this course students will work individually and in groups on multiple case studies, to understand and apply DST methodology, while developing an appreciation for the more fluid and non-linear DST approach.",

    "course_descr":"Safety is a deceptively simple concept. On one end of the spectrum, it is a tangible state of being (Are you at risk of physical violence?) and immediate feeling (Are you comfortable walking alone at night?). At the other end, safety is a broader system embedded in a complex network of social relations, formal and informal organizations, and political dynamics: Do you trust your neighbors? Do you trust the police? Do you have access to the resources you need to be and feel safe from harm? In New York City, the problem of public safety presents a complex tapestry of conflicts, deeply rooted in varying attitudes and policies. The city's approach to public safety often stirs up debates around policing strategies, with some advocating for a robust, proactive law enforcement presence to deter crime, and others calling for more community-based, social justice-oriented methods. And this is only about policing. Most people will say that for them, safety is about much more than policing. Such complexity has led to a broad array of tensions and conflicts in New York City, particularly in neighborhoods like the three in this course, where residents often feel both over-policed and under-resourced.\n  \nIn this course, we will draw on an active research project under the leadership of Dr. Peter Dixon and Dr. Geraldine Downey, which is collecting community-based data around the city to answer two questions: how do residents from communities impacted by violence and policing define safety for themselves? And, what makes these grounded definitions more or less relevant for actual public safety policy? Working in three neighborhoods across Manhattan (Harlem), Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant), and the Bronx (South Bronx), students in this course will work with this community-based data, engaging with municipal decision makers and community members to apply a conflict resolution lens to the rich\u2014and often contradictory\u2014perspectives that city residents bring to the seemingly simple question of what it means to be safe.\n  \nThis course is scheduled to take place in person, in accordance with campus COVID-19 policies. Students are expected to spend on average, 10 hours per week including class time, group work, readings and other assignments, plus one intensive weekend. Throughout, we will engage with city officials and NYC community members to co-analyze residents\u2019 public safety priorities and co-create policy solutions and resolution strategies.",

Through real-world case studies, hands-on projects, and interactive fieldwork, students have the opportunity to examine how advocacy efforts in New York City\u2014a hub of civic engagement\u2014can expand broader policy frameworks and cross into international contexts.\n  \nOver the term, students will explore the theoretical foundations of advocacy, including social movement theory, policy influence, and public opinion formation. They will engage in stakeholder analysis, coalition-building, and the creation of advocacy strategies tailored to shifting political, economic, and social dynamics. Central to this course will be discussions on how traditional advocacy approaches are being redefined in response to growing inequalities and systemic challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptable, intersectional strategies to confront global disparities.\n  \nThe framework emphasizes practical application: students will have the opportunity to develop and implement real advocacy plans, leveraging digital tools, media, and virtual organizing strategies to enhance their impact. Fieldwork, simulations, and collaborative projects will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to tangible issues, empowering them to lead efforts that address pressing social challenges, whether locally in New York City or globally in areas such as international development and human rights.\n  \nKey topics include:\n  \n  \nCrafting advocacy strategies that influence public policy in divided political environments;\n  \nBuilding and managing coalitions across stakeholders;\n  \nEngaging marginalized communities to ensure inclusive and equitable advocacy efforts;\n  \nNavigating the digital advocacy landscape to design impactful campaigns.\n \n  \nBy the end of the course, students should be prepared to plan critically and act decisively in the fast-changing world of advocacy, with the tools, s",

We will begin by considering what objects there are in general (ontology) and what to say about certain puzzling entities (such as holes). Then we will turn to debates about material objects and puzzles about composite objects and the notion of parthood. Next is the issue of how material objects persist over time and survive change in their parts. We shall consider two important views on persistence. We then turn to two issues related to persistence: personal identity over time, and puzzles about time travel. This will lead us into the next part of the course on modality and causation, which concerns the notions of possibility, necessity, laws of nature, and causation. We will consider different views about 'possible worlds'. We will then consider the nature of laws and causation and then turn to the problem of free will. We will look at debates in the metaphysics of properties between realists and nominalists about properties. Then we'll consider causal powers, dispositions, and natural kinds. The section will conclude with problems about the metaphysics of socially constructed kinds such as race or gender.",

This course introduces the theory, evidence, and practice of several common forms of soft tissue mobilization. The class begins with traditional massage that rely on basic theory and progresses to advanced techniques based on principles derived from current fascial theory. Students will develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply soft tissue mobilizations that impact musculoskeletal system impairment of the upper-extremity, lower- extremity, and trunk. Along the way, students apply evidence-based practice concepts and knowledge of anatomy, kinesiology, soft tissue pathophysiology in the experiential learning and discussion-based learning approach. Ultimately, students will be able to make logical clinical decisions that integrate soft tissue mobilization into an effective plan of care.

In the first week, we\u2019ll look at what it means to think sociologically and explore the larger context of gun violence as a racialized and gendered phenomenon. In the second week, we will explore neighborhood gun violence, school (mass) shootings, and police violence as case studies to understand the root causes of violence and the short- and long-term impacts on many groups of people. In the third week, we\u2019ll try to tie it all together by looking at promising solutions to various types of gun violence. One theme across the course will be a sociological consideration of grief and other emotions in the aftermath of gun violence -- as not just personal feelings, but emotions experienced socially, shaped by and through social interactions, and subject to social rules and restrictions which too often reflect larger societal inequalities. We will also highlight the kinds of resilience, resistance, and activism that emerge from individuals and communities after experiences of gun violence. We will examine policy debates as sociologists trying to understand their contours, the social issues at their core, and the ways political responses also reflect and even perpetuate social inequalities. Together, we\u2019ll attempt to make sense of our three seemingly disparate case studies as part of a larger problem, explore the affective dimensions that shape this problem, and the way attuning ourselves to social and public emotions may help us see potential solutions",

    "course_descr":"Radicalization, both online and offline, poses significant challenges to societies worldwide. This course provides a comprehensive examination of the complex interplay between radicalization and education. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and practical exercises, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of radicalization and its implications for education and society at large. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will gain insights into the processes, mechanisms, and dynamics of radicalization within educational settings. The course explores the theoretical frameworks and concepts related to radicalization, including the socio-psychological factors, group dynamics, and ideological influences that contribute to an individual's susceptibility to radical ideologies. Students will examine case studies and real-world examples to understand the various forms of radicalization, from religious extremism to political extremism. A central focus of the course is the role of education in both perpetuating and mitigating radicalization. Students will critically analyze the ways in which educational institutions can serve as breeding grounds for radical ideologies, as well as the potential of education to promote critical thinking, resilience, and social cohesion as a means of countering radicalization. By the end of the course, students\u00a0will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to critically assess and respond to radicalization within educational contexts, contributing to efforts to promote tolerance, diversity, and social cohesion.",

    "course_descr":"This course examines the rapidly evolving social, cultural, behavioral, political, and socioeconomic dimensions of public health in community, national, regional, and global contexts. We consider how health as well as the generation of knowledge about health are being continually re-shaped by factors such as age, gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, social class, geography, and interactions within physical and digital environments. We learn how to analyze dynamic public health problems and identify agile solutions by casting light on individual risk factors as well as larger structural forces. We consider how social media enables the rapid proliferation of hotly contested messages and information about the rights of the individual versus the welfare of the public. Finally, we critically examine the ways in which our understandings of health and well-being perpetually shape, and are shaped by, health care systems in flux, the mediation of our own values, and our changing assumptions about the world. \"Gone Viral: Public Health in a Global Context\" is an exploration of the spread of pathogens and other health threats as well as the spread of ideas and knowledge about them via social media and other platforms. The course is offered twice during the NextGen Leadership Institute (NGLI); students may choose to register for either Session I or Session II. The course is structured around nine (9) in-person sessions that meet during a three-week period. The format combines interactive lectures with discussion-based seminars. The course introduces students to fundamental concepts and issues in public health. Students read selected excerpts from public health textbooks, public health journals, and popular magazines. Short videos, social media content, and documentary films supplement the readings, providing a diversified basis for lively collegial debate. Concurrent with class sessions, students also engage in basic research outside of the classroom by conducting rapid ethnographic assessment. Research methods include observational exercises in public spaces, recruitment of and informal interviews with respondents, small group assignments within walking distance of campus, and participant-observation in online spaces where public health ideas are evinced and negotiated. The course has six learning objectives: 1. Introduce definitions of disease, illness, and well-being from various perspectives. 2. Introduce students to a population perspective on health and disease. 3. Define and describe the social determinant",

What different institutional forms does democratic government take? 4. Are some institutions more likely than others to produce significant social outcomes such as representation, accountability, redistribution, and democratic stability? Because the study of comparative politics requires knowledge of specific cases, we will focus on eight countries: China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and the United Kingdom.

    "course_descr":"Since WWII, in a stunning historical turnaround, much of Europe has gone from centuries of war to an increasingly inclusive project of peaceful and innovative regional cooperation. Yet, despite such apparent success, the EU has recently come to face countless challenges: the European democratic deficit, the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, Euro-skepticism, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some observers have even come to question the limits of European integration.\n  \n In this course, we will focus on the contemporary chapter of European politics, asking crucial questions of the integration process. How do national, intergovernmental, and supranational dynamics play out across policy areas? What are the colonial and neocolonial roots of European politics? How have European politics evolved in response to the many recent crises? What further developments should we expect? Will member states follow the path of ever-greater integration and eventually form a federation? Will the European Union fall apart? Will the integration project develop into a multi-speed, modular governance system?\n  \n With these questions in mind, this course will explore the politics of the European Union across a diverse array of policy domains. Building on a foundational two sessions on the history and structure of the EU, each week will tackle a core policy realm: the economy, migration, common security, foreign policy, the environment \u2013 to name a few. In doing so, the class reviews state-of-the-art political science research with the double objective of understanding the theoretical and empirical substance of academic studies and applying their insights to real-world political issues.",

We will explore these questions and others by focusing on topics such as international trade, foreign aid, investment, and the environment. For each topic, we will use a variety of theoretical lenses and then investigate the evidence in favor of each. More generally, the course will consider the challenges of drawing casual inferences in the field of international political economy. There are no prerequisites for this course but an introductory economy course would be helpful. Students will write a short reading response each week and produce a research proposal for studying a topic related to international political economy, though they do not need to actually conduct this research.",

    "course_descr":"Today, the movement of peoples across the Earth and consistent attempts to control or prevent that movement are ubiquitous global phenomena. There is hardly any land on the planet that is not claimed as the territory of one state or another. Borders have become the most common, although by no means only, site in which states try to assert their power over movement. The causes, impacts, and ethical stakes of border crossings have become fixtures of both national and international political discourse.\n  \nThis course will examine questions about the politics and ethics of borders and immigration in the modern world. To inform our discussion, we will engage with ideas from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including political theory, history, law, political science, and sociology. While this course will focus on the US context and pay special attention to the history and dynamics of US immigration policy, we will also survey how immigration and borders intersect with global politics.\n  \nThis course is designed to be a 6-week intensive class. The first two weeks concern foundational questions and key concepts. These include the question of what constitutes membership in a political community (citizenship), what exactly borders are and what functions they serve.\u00a0 Week 3 turns to the question of why people migrate, what the most prominent migration policy regimes are, and the history and present state of American immigration policy. Week 4 turns to the moral question of whether states \nshould\n be entitled to their territory and, if so, whether they have a right to control their borders. We will examine debates both for and against open borders. Week 5 examines further questions on who immigration regimes prioritize and who they do not. Week 6 turns to the causes, law, and ethics of refugees and asylum seekers.",

Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the \u201cleast dangerous branch,\u201d making law, not policy, without real power or influence.\n  \nOur thematic questions will be: \u00a0How much power and discretion do judges have in the U.S? \u00a0What drives their decision-making?",

    "course_descr":"The need for more effective and equitable engagement with communities has become increasingly evident to public health professionals in recent years. Now, more than ever, the importance of developing deeper and more engaged academic\/institutional-community partnerships is necessary to address systems of structural inequity. However, developing these relationships requires not only knowledge of equity-based partnering formats, but the cultivation of complex skill sets that allow public health practitioners to fully develop relationships across all phases of community collaboration. Two valuable forms of community engagement that public health practitioners and students can make use of are community-based participatory research and service learning, which are the focus of the ACEP seminar. Additionally, this seminar acknowledges that community engagement is a diverse space where people from a variety of professional and personal backgrounds come together and provides knowledge and skills in important interprofessional competencies that are necessary for public ACEP Seminar, 2024 2 of 15 health professionals to understand and be able to deploy. For many years, people working in the technology space have recognized the benefits of \u201cmatrixed teams,\u201d similarly over the past few years the notion of interprofessionalism has become an important and required aspect of allied health and public health professional training. Research has shown that bringing together students from two or more professions to learn about, from, and with each other is extremely effective in all forms of collaboration (within research and intervention teams and with communities) and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes. According to the World Health Organization, \u201cOnce students understand how to work interprofessionally, they are ready to enter the workplace as a member of the collaborative practice team. This is a key step in moving health systems from fragmentation to a position of strength.\u201d The overall goal of the ACEP seminar is for students to learn about and begin to practice the tenets of three frameworks: Interprofessional Education (IPE), Service-Learning (SL), and Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). Additionally, students will be supported in problem solving changes \/problems that arise during their APEx. With regard to interprofessional engagement, the seminar will provide students with a solid understanding of four key IPE competencies: roles\/responsibilities, teams\/teamwork, ethics\/values,",

This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",

It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class \u2013 through readings and a dozen hands-on activities \u2013 students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI\u2019s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people\u2019s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI\u2019s \u201cweirdness.\u201d Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills \u2013 like in critical thinking and empathy \u2013 in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, \u201cSo far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1\/36th of the time, thanks to AI.

The focus will be on the revised and expanded DBT Skills Manual released in late 2014.\u00a0 Through course assignments and in-class activities, students will have an opportunity to learn the content of the skills, as well as how to structure and conduct a DBT skills group.\u00a0\u00a0 Students will develop a beginning understanding of standard comprehensive DBT, the particular function of each treatment component, (e.g., individual, group, consultation team, coaching) and how DBT skills relate to the other program components. The basic format of this\u00a0course will include the Instructor's presentation of concepts and principles, group discussion, modeling, role-plays, and technique coaching.\u00a0 As a practice elective, the major focus is on skill development.\u00a0 As such, students are expected participate fully in in-class practice exercises and be receptive to feedback from their classmates.",

It is designed to prepare students for intensive DBT training and for their DBT internships in the community and for ensuring that program interns are prepared for beginning DBT practice with client populations exhibiting a range of behavioral dysfunctions. These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class. Personal development as a clinician and personal practices that improve performance are an integral part of all these activities.",

    "course_descr":"It is widely acknowledged that as a variable, 'race' often explains a significant portion of the variation we observe in patterns of morbidity and mortality. But it isalso understood that race is a socially determined construct that functions as a proxy for a host of other variables associated with, among others, socioeconomic status, culture, place of residence, and position within social networks. The question that we will explore together is how to deconstruct \u2018race\u2019 to understand what factor or group of factors create the patterns of health disparities that are so dramatically present among populations of color here in the US. COVID-19 has exploited these factors tocreate a burden of disease in many communities of color that will substantially impact medicine and public health for much of the foreseeable future.One of the issues of particular salience for medical and public health research is how to go beyond describing the correlation between race and health to create effective interventions for eliminating such disparities. How can our exploration of health disparities generate the levers that we can use to promote health and prevent disease? How well do our explanatory models of race and health provide us with the tools to eliminate disparities and create a system dedicated to creating and preserving health equity?",

In 2008 the country embarked on an effort to improve their situation by creating and approving a new constitution.\u00a0Despite all of these efforts, indigenous people continue to struggle in Ecuador. For indigenous women specially the battle goes beyond the economic hardship, as they face domestic violence and abuse in a daily basis.\u00a0\n  \nThe proposed course is designed to provide students with a unique one-to-one interaction with Spanish native speakers in three different sites: the Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest Reservation of Papallacta, the Reservation of Mandaripanga, and the Runatupari Community in the Andean Region of Ecuador.\u00a0 It aims to:\n  \n1. Explore, learn and document the work some indigenous groups have been doing since the new constitution was approved back in 2008.\n  \n2. Provide students with a service-learning opportunity working hand in hand when possible with women community leaders at the different sites.\n  \n3. Learn about how their communities work to preserve their resources and maintain a sustainable culture.\n  \n4. Immerse themselves in the Spanish language and culture by interacting, sharing, and living with native Spanish speakers.\n  \n5. Have student produce a focused final essay linking the key concepts from the readings and their lived experiences in the communities visited.",

It is now routinely applied in such program areas as transportation, water projects, health, training and education, criminal justice, environmental protection, urban policy and even in the international arena such as foreign direct investment. Many of the techniques of CBA can also be applied to private sector decision-making. The objective of CBA is to determine whether the benefits of a particular program, policy or decision outweigh its costs. The techniques used to determine this are sometimes quite simple, but on other, increasingly frequent occasions are highly sophisticated. Sophisticated cost benefit studies are based on a framework that utilizes the basic concepts of economic theory. In addition, statistical and econometric analyses are often needed to estimate program effects from diverse available data. The course has two parts: methodology and practice. The goal is for students to be practically adept to undertake an independent cost-benefit analysis.",

The applicability and usage of computer-based models have increased dramatically in recent years, due to the extraordinary improvements in computer, information and communication technologies, including not just hardware but also model-solution techniques and user interfaces.\u00a0 Twenty years ago working with a model meant using an expensive mainframe computer, learning a complex programming language, and struggling to compile data by hand; the entire process was clearly marked \u201cexperts only.\u201d\u00a0 The rise of personal computers, friendly interfaces (such as spreadsheets), and large databases has made modeling far more accessible to managers.\u00a0 Information has come to be recognized as a critical resource, and models play a key role in deploying this resource, in organizing and structuring information so that it can be used productively.",

    "course_descr":"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world\u2019s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world\u2019s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2\u00b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.\n  \nStudents in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries, \u00a0data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments. A key component of this course will be critical evaluation of both existing accounting and reporting standards as well as GHG emissions reduction target setting practices.\n  \nThis course will introduce many of the challenges facing carbon accounting practitioners and will require students to recommend solutions to these challenges derived through critical analysis. Classes will examine current examples of greenhouse gas reporting efforts and will allow students the opportunity to recommend improved calculation and reporting methods.",

It starts with a strong foundation in accounting and corporate finance, then moves on to ESG\/Impact screening of potential investments, along with valuation techniques used to arrive at a purchase price. It will explore financial models that can aggregate multiple variables used to drive investment decisions.\n  \nTo understand and lead a transition to a sustainability-aware business, managers must first be familiar with the terminology, practices and consequences of traditional accounting and finance. Students will learn traditional financial and accounting methods and tools. We will examine how these methods and tools are changing to improve product and service design, resource efficiency and allocation, employee productivity and sustainability performance outcomes. Students will learn how value is created in a company and the different methods employed to create that value, conduct due diligence, discuss optimal capital structure to finance a transaction, execute a transaction, and implement a Sustainability-based value-added operating plan to the target company. The course will conclude with students preparing a persuasive investment memo and accompanying financial model to the investment committee of an impact investing asset management firm. The course also provides a practical introduction to selected non-financial accounting topics including sustainability reporting standards, ESG corporate performance indicators and corporate social responsibility report (CSR Reporting).",

This course will introduce\n regulated ESG reporting, emphasizing climate disclosure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n (SEC) Climate disclosure will serve as the basis for the discussion and could be used as a case study to\n illustrate the best practices for administering a sustainability reporting regime and sustainability reporting\n more broadly within an organization. By the conclusion of this course, students will be able to design,\n manage, and implement new processes and procedures within their organizations to respond to the new\n SEC Climate Disclosures and other forthcoming regulated and mandatory disclosures.\n To increase comparability, relevancy, and accuracy of the environmental data and sustainability\n information reported by companies on climate and human capital matters, the SEC prioritized climate\n change and ESG regulations throughout 2022, promising new rules to better inform and protect investors\n and other stakeholders. This unprecedented action paves the way for disclosures that were previously\n voluntary to become required. The evolution of the ESG landscape will considerably transform ESG from\n a reputational risk concern to a regulatory-driven activity, thereby increasing the ESG lens\/scrutiny at the\n level of financial statements.\n Due to the complexity of this SEC Climate Rule, this course will focus on the SEC Climate Disclosures in\n their first year of implementation so that students can interpret, acquire a deeper understanding of the new\n rules, and develop a Year 1 implementation strategy. To prepare the next generation of sustainability\n leaders to respond to this new regulatory regime, the intended audience of this course consists of\n sustainability leaders from a diversity of industries responsible for climate reporting.",

    "course_descr":"This seminar explores the varied ways artists responded to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 90s through performance, theatre, and activist art. \u00a0As government indifference persisted and deaths soared, artists became radicalized and contemporary art and performance became a vehicle for activism.\u00a0 We will follow different tactics in artwork responding to AIDS including the use of gay desire as a weapon and emblem of the fight for visibility.\u00a0 The work we will view, think about, discuss, and write about is political, often angry, and always suffused with loss.\u00a0 Because AIDS affected marginalized communities whose histories are still being told, we will examine a range of artists and materials that includes but also moves beyond the gay white male perspective.\u00a0 We will spend time with theatre work by Reza Abdoh, Tony Kushner, and Mar\u00eda Irene Forn\u00e9s, videos by Juanita Mohammad, visual art by Kia LaBeija, Felix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, Martin Wong, and David Wojnarowicz, music by Mark Adamo and Diamanda Gal\u00e1s, among other lesser known artist\/activists. \u00a0We will approach these works alongside critical and creative writing by Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz and Audre Lorde among others.\u00a0 The final project will be a research paper, built in stages throughout the semester, that engages critically with artwork that intersects with AIDS activism.",

Students will gain a better understanding of the function of cities, the forces causing patterns of urbanization across the planet, the key debates around sprawl versus compactness and the ways these dimensions impact areas such as the quality and standard of living of ordinary households, issues of justice and equity, climate change, and roles of markets and government in managing cities. The course delves into the challenges of the governance of cities, the opportunities, and obstacles to strengthening local democracy and accountability to all social classes, and the challenges of achieving just and equitable outcomes for all city residents. Case studies cover several cities in the Global South, as well as a focus on US cities which include possible assignments and field trips in NYC.",

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts.

From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong \u201cnut graph,\u201d to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into \u201cthe field\u201d (of New York City) to craft their own.

Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a \u201cmilieu\u201d of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism.
