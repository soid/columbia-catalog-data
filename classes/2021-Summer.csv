AHIS BC2018,FREESTYLE/DISPLCEMNT CONT ART,";Freestyle,; the important 2001exhibition held at the Studio Museum in Harlem in New York, helped usher a generation of artists into public discourse and scrutiny. The exhibition highlighted a cacophony of influences, histories, and art tendencies. The wide array of artworks and approaches to art making that it put on display challenged the art world and questioned conventional thinking about art made by artists of color in the twenty-first century. Taking the Freestyle exhibition as a point of departure, this course will explore a series of questions including: How do the after-effects of displacement radically change an artists way of making art? What kind of impact have contemporary notions of diaspora, migration and exile have on the new art practices? What insights do these new practices and the objects and performances that result from them produce? We will study the visual art practices related to this trajectory and the exhibitions that contextualize them. At the same time, the course will challenge students to experiment and construct artworks from their own subjectivities in ways that intersect with the questions and concepts that arise from the investigation.",Connie H Choi,5:30pm,8:40pm,00213,Barnard College,X2018-20212-001,FREESTYLE/DISPLCEMNT CONT,Art History @Barnard,AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/X2018-20212-001/,203 Diana Center,,,3,,MW,20212AHIS2018X001,SEMINAR

Through a variety of reading, writing and making projects, this seminar studies the implications of our unbound and limitless death drive. Can any viable futures be located under the regimes of such imagination, futures that do not involve disposing of ourselves?

Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",Lindsey P Schneider,1:00pm,4:10pm,11185,Morningside,S2314-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S2314-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212AHIS2314S001,LECTURE

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.

AHIS S3441,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MUSEUM,"This course will introduce students to the history of museums and display practices through New York collections. The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts. Students will have the opportunity to meet museum educators, conservators and curators through on site teaching in a variety of institutions.",Risham Majeed,1:00pm,4:10pm,11191,Morningside,S3441-20212-001,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MU,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3441-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,TR,20212AHIS3441S001,LANGUAGE
AHIS UN2102,GORE & VIOLENCE IN GREEK ART,"Severed heads of young boys thrown at enemies, necks of virginal maidens slashed by warriors’ swords, children stabbed to death by their own mothers, tongues of raped women cut by the abusers: these are not the images one expects to encounter in Greek art, which is still almost exclusively and rather anachronistically associated with beauty, symmetry, and formal perfection. And yet, violent themes of death and abuse in all their gory details populate the world of Greek images from the Archaic to the Hellenistic period. Aim of the course is to offer an alternative – more ‘realistic’ – view of ancient Greek art and understand its violence and goriness as parts of its (at least) two faces; to add, as it were, the lightless night of violence to the luminous day of the athletic, heroic, and divine realms.Violence in art will be placed in a broader political, social, historical, and intellectual context. In addition, violence in art will be understood as a powerful visual means for the construction and de-construction or even destruction of images of dangerous Otherness: the aggressive barbarian (Persians), the uncontrolled nature outside the constraints of the polis (Centaurs), and the all too powerful or independent female (Amazons).",Ioannis Mylonopoulos,9:00am,12:10pm,11495,Morningside,W2102-20212-001,GORE & VIOLENCE IN GREEK,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/W2102-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212AHIS2102W001,LECTURE
AHIS UN2427,Twentieth-Century Architecture,"This course examines some of the key moments of architectural modernity in the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how architecture participated in the making of a new world order. It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts. Reading primary sources from the period under examination is a crucial part of the course.",Zeynep Celik Alexander,1:00pm,4:10pm,12149,Morningside,W2427-20212-001,20TH CENTURY ARCHITECTURE,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/W2427-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212AHIS2427W001,LECTURE

AHIS UN3100,"Hellenistic Sculpture: Intellectuals, Go","Obsession with the Classical often kept us from looking at the Hellenistic period with its artistic achievements as a time of innovation and\ experimentation in art. In Hellenistic times, new cultural and artistic centers arose besides Athens: Alexandria in Egypt, Antiocheia and Pergamon in Asia Minor, or Rhodes. Especially in sculpture, artists and patrons demonstrated an unprecedented interest in subjects such as ugly old women, working peasants, slaves with disfigured bodies, or non-Greeks. The seminar will study the sculpture of the Hellenistic period as an extremely imaginative and dynamic artistic expression without the Classical bias. In addition, it will look into the societal conditions that allowed this multi-cultural and rather inclusive style in sculpture to be created. The styles of the various Hellenistic artistic centers will be individually analysed based on representative works and then compared to each other and to the sculptural traditions of the Classical period, so that Hellenistic sculpture can be understood both as a continuation of the Classical and especially Late Classical sculpture and as an artistic, intellectual, and social creation – a creation that often went against the ideals of the past.",Ioannis Mylonopoulos,1:00pm,4:10pm,12106,Morningside,W3100-20212-001,HELLENISTIC SCULPTURE,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/W3100-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212AHIS3100W001,SEMINAR

AHIS UN3321,Modern Titian,"In The Stroke of the Brush (1989), David Rosand introduced the authoriality of Titian’s brushwork by discussing it in the light of contemporary painting processes, such as Willem de Kooning’s Abstract Expressionism. In the exhibition Titian: Love, Desire, Death, currently at the National Gallery, London, Matthias Wivel presents the Renaissance Venetian artist as the “father of modern painting”. To what extent can a Renaissance painter be modern? How can we conceptualize that modernity? Examining Titian’s life and work in sixteenth century Venice in the light of sources, literature and technical data, the seminar will reconsider the paradigm of the modernity of the Renaissance master. Investigating what defined painting as ‘modern’ in Titian’s own period, as well as its reception in modern time, the seminar will also discuss how the theorization of contemporary societal issues could allow us to think differently about Titian’s work.  The course will be run as a seminar, with meetings devoted to discussions. Students will be responsible for the summary and introduction of the weekly readings for discussion.

AMPO PS0101,Wealth and Democracy in the United State,"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.  Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and/or national level.  Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.  In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",Geoffrey C Upton,3:10pm,5:00pm,10218,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Wealth and Democracy in t,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),AMPO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AMPO/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212AMPO0101KD01,LECTURE

ANTH GR5283,The Sovereignty of Critique,"This is a graduate-level, interdisciplinary survey of the literature of Critical Indigenous Studies. 
  Indigeneity is a condition that is attached to place and notions of time, but these are not 
any
 places, they are territories that have been targeted by others for possession, and this is not 
any
 time, this is time imagined to be in the past.  So to belong to those places in the present structures life, politics and effort in particular ways, as land, waters and other forms of liveleness have been pushed to an imagined past, in an ongoing taking of territory and resources.  Indigenous scholars, activists and memoirists provide an archive of this history of dispossession but one that is also countered by resistance and refusal to the push to disappear people from land and waters.  The intellectual and political work is rooted in questions of sovereignty, jurisdiction over territory and people, and deep textual and representional and political practices of critique. This intensive course is an advanced, interdisciplinary survey of the literature in Native American Studies that roots itself in key works that speak from that critique and history of dispossession. The syllabus is formed from some anthropological classics, Native and Indigenous Studies, memoir, political theory and poetry/critique. This course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates (thesis writers) with instructor permission only.",Audra Simpson,4:10pm,6:00pm,14334,Morningside,G5283-20212-001,The Sovereignty of Critiq,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audra_Simpson,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/G5283-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,T,20212ANTH5283G001,SEMINAR

ANTH GU4149,ART STRIKE: MUSEUM DISSIDENTS & DISSONAN,"In the aftermath of World War II, rebuilt (Axis) and surviving (Allied) museums presented themselves as havens from a violent world– places for quiet introspection and appreciation of modern art. As the world moved through peak decolonization of former empires in the 1970s, this concept of museums was challenged by artists who asked that the contemporary art wings of the museum be a space for active discourse about current events. In the last forty years, these trends have accelerated as community organizations focused on the contemporary museum as sites for their struggles around migrant labor (Guggenheim Abu Dhabi), reparations (British Museum), state violence (moCA Cleveland), decolonization (Brooklyn Museum), surveillance (M+ Hong Kong), arms trade (Whitney Museum), etc. On the other side, museums have also expanded staff diversity, education departments, non-profit activities, and the idea of the museum as an investor in communities. This seminar begins from the hypothesis that this change in museums comes from tectonic shifts in the ecosystem for contemporary art in each city: museums (staff, unionized labor, curators, education departments), audiences (students, general public), organizations (community boards, local organizations, artist collectives), funders (galleries, collectors, donors, grant agencies), and media (newspapers, blogs, tiktok, twitter, instagram). We will build an ethnography of contemporary art, concluding with a case study (museum, art project, artist collective, etc) researched by each student as their final project. We will read accounts from anthropology, art history, and museum studies, interspersed with documentations of art installations.",Naeem Mohaiemen,1:00pm,4:10pm,11351,Morningside,W4149-20212-001,ART STRIKE: MUSEUM DISSID,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naeem_Mohaiemen,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/W4149-20212-001/,517 Hamilton Hall,Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212ANTH4149W001,LECTURE

 created the conditions we call climate change. With this we will take a particular interest in the question of how
 race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, and gender articulate with the material effects of climate change. The course
 also focuses on how we, as scholars, citizens, and activists can work to alter these current conditions in ways
 that foster social and ecological justice for all living beings. Although we will ground our scholarship in
 anthropology, to encourage interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary thought, weekly readings will be drawn
 from across scholarly and activist canons. While becoming familiar with scholarly and activist conversations
 about space and place, risk and vulnerability, and ontology and epistemology, we will work through a series of
 recent events as case studies to understand causes, effects, affects, and potential solutions.",Paige West,1:00pm,4:10pm,10730,Morningside,S2724-20212-001,ANTHROPOLOGY OF CLIMATE C,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S2724-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212ANTH2724S001,LECTURE
ANTH S3921,ANTI-COLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, Aimé Cesairé’s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi’s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,9:00am,12:10pm,10869,Morningside,S3921-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3921-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212ANTH3921S001,SEMINAR

ANTH UN2215,"CULTURE, SOCIETY, AND CATASTROPHE","Catastrophes and disasters are often seen as inherently natural crises when in reality they are both caused and affected by anthropogenic forces and their impacts are conditioned by existing social, economic, and political factors. To truly understand catastrophes, such as the incipient climate crisis, extreme weather events, and even the current coronavirus pandemic, we will examine the complex interplay between environmental and social factors through both anthropological and human rights lenses. Specifically, the course will address the social and cultural aspects of catastrophe by focusing on the climate crisis, its causes, and its impacts. First, the course will consider the phenomena of anthropogenic climate change. Second, the course will examine the theoretical and empirical literatures that have elucidated the nature of climate change as a social, as well as a biophysical, process. Finally, the course will consider how human rights and other legal regimes do or do not address the social justice and humanitarian issues created by anthropogenic climate change.

ANTH UN3663,The Ancient Table: Archaeology of Cookin,"Prerequisites: None Humans don’t just eat to live. The ways we prepare, eat, and share our food is a complex reflection of our histories, environments, and ideologies. Whether we prefer coffee or tea, cornbread or challah, chicken breast or chicken feet, our tastes are expressive of social ties and social boundaries, and are linked to ideas of family and of foreignness. How did eating become such a profoundly cultural experience? This seminar takes an archaeological approach to two broad issues central to eating: First, what drives human food choices both today and in the past? Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies. Topics that will be covered include the nature of the first cooking, beer-brewing and feasting, writing of the early recipes, gender roles and ‘domestic’ life, and how a national cuisine takes shape. Through the course of the semester we will explore food practices from Pleistocene Spain to historic Monticello, with particular emphasis on the earliest cuisines of China, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean.",Camilla Sturm,2:10pm,4:00pm,00216,Barnard College,W3663-20212-002,ANCT TBL: ARCH COOKING &,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/W3663-20212-002/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20212ANTH3663W002,SEMINAR

ANTH W4160,"Elementary Forms of Populism: Authority,","This course ethnographically and theoretically investigates the phenomenon of populism by zeroing in on the political constellations employed in the name of “people:"" religion, ethnicity, gender, affect, power, and knowledge. Taking our departure from empirical and scholarly examples from Turkey, the course also resorts to a wide range of examples, from Latin American countries to the contemporary US. We will explicitly refrain from subscribing to a classical position about populist politics, aiming to go beyond discourse analysis in order to ethnographically examine how populist practices gain legitimacy and efficacy on the ground. We will be discussing the ways in which political, social, economic relations entangle with each other, specifically focusing on the Turkish case. Are the supporters of populist movements mistaken in their perception? What is the role of “alternative facts” in establishing political legitimacy? Can experts and scientists be alternatives to populist politicians? Are the right-wing arguments embedded in the constitution of social and material worlds that liberal, progressive movements fail to question in radical ways? Ultimately, we aim to achieve an ethnographically sensitive understanding of mass politics in our contemporary moment.",Firat Kurt,12:10pm,2:00pm,11502,Morningside,W4160-20212-001,Elementary Forms of Popul,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/W4160-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,WR,20212ANTH4160W001,LECTURE

 What is Architecture?
 An introduction to ways of understanding architecture framed around four topics: Concept, Context, Form, and Materials. Students are challenged to examine and understand the effects of physical environment on human experience, the factors that influence architectural forms, and the role that architecture plays in shaping our behaviors and civic cultures
 
 Participants gain an understanding of architecture through slide presentations, readings, virtual visits to buildings, and discussions around observations and analyses of architecture and public spaces around the world, both iconic and lesser-known. We examine different types of buildings such as museums, churches, libraries, and transportation hubs. While the primary focus is on learning through observation and analysis, students also learn to think and imagine through hands-on, at-home model-making, using materials they should be able to find around their homes.",Aki Ishida,9:10am,11:00am,10316,Morningside,N0103-20212-D01,Understanding the Art: Ar,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),APAR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/APAR/N0103-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212APAR0103ND01,LECTURE

ARAR PS0101,Looking at Architecture: A Primer on Sty,"This course introduces students to the major historical styles of architecture in the Western hemisphere, with a consideration of notable examples from the East. Stylistic models from both the recent and ancient past have influenced how buildings look today. Likewise, social changes have shaped the way we inhabit the built environment. Understanding architecture in a historic context can enrich our experience of traveling, or of merely walking down the street where we live. It helps us connect our personal spaces and neighborhoods to places and cultures from different times, geographies, and cultures.  Participants learn to recognize and describe the formal characteristics of architecture broadly described as Classical, Medieval, Victorian, Modernist, and Postmodernist, while recognizing that few buildings are designed in a “pure” or exclusive idiom. We analyze historic and modern images of buildings which exemplify the most recognizable styles of each era, both in the United States and abroad. When possible, we visit New York city sites whose architecture represents or evokes one or more styles under discussion.",Nenette Arroyo,3:10pm,5:00pm,10321,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Architecture: Primer on S,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ARAR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ARAR/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ARAR0101KD01,LECTURE

They depend on multiple resources and mobilize varied technological innovations.

BCAB PS0101,"Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, AI, and Be","This course is designed for students who have an interest in the future of finance, technology, blockchain, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and work. Beginning with an exploration of Fintech (financial technology), we explore technology’s impact on everything from banking to real estate to Wall Street. Additionally, we look at how artificial intelligence (AI) will automate and reduce the need for human workers, as AI, Fintech, and other technologies are combined to automate many tasks.  After gaining a solid understanding of the real-world use cases of Fintech and the everyday ways it impacts the economy, social justice, and our lives, students take a journey of discovery into the world of AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency. Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, cryptocurrency and decentralized ledger technology, aka blockchain, have emerged as an economic force majeure, disrupting the fundamentals of how people interact and how they perceive money. In addition to pushing the evolution of money, blockchain technology is now poised to disrupt how we organize businesses and the future of work. Course participants explore the organizational impacts and transformations caused by blockchain and cryptocurrencies and examine what this will mean to them as future CEOs and global business and thought leaders.  The course concludes by exploring the perspective of entrepreneurs and innovators, further examining how technologies come together to form the businesses, disruptions, and methodologies of the 21st Century. Participants walk away with a fundamental understanding of what tokens and cryptocurrencies are; how businesses leverage blockchain technology, AI, and other Fintech applications; and how digital transformation impacts social interactions and the future of work.

We will learn how living systems convert environmental resources into energy through metabolism, and how they use this energy and these materials to build the molecules required for the diverse functions of life. We will discuss the applications of this biochemical knowledge to mechanisms of disease and to drug discovery. We will look at examples of drug discovery related to neurodegeneration, cancer, and the SARS-CoV-2 COVID19 pandemic. This course satisfies the requirement of most medical schools for introductory biochemistry, and is suitable for advanced undergraduates, and beginning graduate students. This course is equivalent to and replaces the prior course named UN3501, and is equivalent to the course offered in the Fall semester. This course is a co-requiste to GU4501.  We will meet twice each week in Zoom (Tuesday and Thursday 2:30-5:15, BCHM GU4501) to discuss the course material. We will then meet Friday 9:30-10:30 each week in virtual reality, using the Spatial.io platform and an Oculus Quest headset. In VR, we will examine the 3D spatial concepts relevant to biochemistry, where you will be able to examine molecular structures in an immersive format.",Brent R Stockwell,9:30am,10:30am,12148,Morningside,W4505-20212-001,Biochemistry I Virtual Re,Summer Session (SUMM),BCHM,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Stockwell,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BCHM/W4505-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,"BCHM GU4501

BIGD PS0101,"Big Data, Machine Learning, and their Re","The exponential growth of data, advances in cloud computing, and machine learning have transformed every industry from retail and banking to healthcare and education. This introductory-level course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset.  We focus on the strategic use of data and innovative technologies to derive actionable business insights. Participants develop a strong foundation in data-driven thinking for solving real-world problems. They are introduced to a variety of popular technologies for data analytics and gain a familiarity with programming in R, a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.  From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.  Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.

Much of the in-class work involves working with R. Students learn how to import, export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data; use statistical summaries; and run and evaluate machine learning models.  From the start of the course participants are immersed in the world of data: they are introduced to the concepts of big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. Through hands-on experience and practice they study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions.  Toward the conclusion of the course, students work in groups on a final project and presentation, thereby (a) solidify their newly acquired analytical and programming skills and (b) practicing storytelling with data.  Participants should expect a dynamic and interactive environment: hands-on exercises, teamwork, continuous in-class dialogue, demonstrations, and interactive presentations.

BIOL BC3597,GUIDED RESEARCH,"Similar to BIOL BC3591-BIOL BC3592, this is a one-semester course that provides students with degree credit for unpaid research 
without 
a seminar component. You may enroll in BIOL BC3597 for between 1-4 credits per semester. As a rule of thumb, you should be spending approximately 3 hours per week per credit on your research project.  A 
Project Approval Form
 must be submitted to the department each semester that you enroll in this course. Your Barnard research mentor (if your lab is at Barnard) or internal adviser in the Biology Department (if your lab is elsewhere) must approve your planned research 
before
 you enroll in BIOL BC3597. You should sign up for your mentor's section.   This course does not fulfill any Biology major requirements.  It is open to students beginning in their first year.",Paul E Hertz,,,00210,Barnard College,X3597-20212-020,,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOL/X3597-20212-020/,,,,1-4,"BIOL BC3591

BIOL GU4075,BIOLOGY AT PHYSICAL EXTREMES,"Prerequisites: one year each of biology and physics, or the instructor's permission. This is a combined lecture/seminar course designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The course will cover a series of cases where biological systems take advantage of physical phenomena in counter intuitive and surprising ways to accomplish their functions. In each of these cases, we will discuss different physical mechanisms at work. We will limit our discussions to simple, qualitative arguments. We will also discuss experimental methods enabling the study of these biological systems. Overall, the course will expose students to a wide range of physical concepts involved in biological processes.",Ozgur Sahin,2:10pm,4:00pm,10747,Morningside,G4075-20212-001,BIOLOGY AT PHYSICAL EXTRE,Summer Session (SUMM),BIOL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOL/G4075-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212BIOL4075G001,SEMINAR
BIOL GU4310,VIROLOGY,"The basic thesis of the course is that all viruses adopt a common strategy. The strategy is simple:  1. Viral genomes are contained in metastable particles.  2. Genomes encode gene products that promote an infectious cycle (mechanisms for genomes to enter cells, replicate, and exit in particles).  3. Infection patterns range from benign to lethal; infections can overcome or co-exist with host defenses.  Despite the apparent simplicity, the tactics evolved by particular virus families to survive and prosper are remarkable. This rich set of solutions to common problems in host/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution.  The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population. The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles, the interactions of viruses with host organisms, and how these lead to disease are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.",Vincent R Racaniello,10:45am,12:20pm,10741,Morningside,W4310-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),BIOL,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Racaniello,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BIOL/W4310-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MTWR,20212BIOL4310W001,LECTURE

BUFE PS0303,The Future of the Space Economy,"Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other leading investment firms have predicted that the space economy will be worth trillions of dollars within the next few decades. In this course we explore a number of key issues having to do with the space industry and the emerging space economy with the intention of preparing participants to be leaders in those fields.  Potential topics to be covered include:  
  
How private businesses are changing the new space race
  
Why space commercialization will lead to a Fifth Industrial Revolution
  
What old and new financial models are enabling the growth of space technology
  
The role of NASA, the Space Force, NOAA, and other government agencies
  
Should we be investing in space when there are so many challenges facing humanity on Earth?
  
How do businesses profit from working within the space economy?
  
What does the work of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin tell us about opportunities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the moon, and Mars?
  
What steps a business must go through to be part of the new space race
  
How new private and national programs will add to the complexity and vibrancy of the economy
  
What is the role of space in human rights?
  
How does the improvement of communities in space lead to social and technology improvements?
  
What environmental problems can be solved using space technology?
  
What is the role of traditional financial institutions such as banks and mutual funds, and how does that compare to the role of family private offices, VCs, and hedge funds in disruptive industries like the space economy?
 
  The course draws on fundamental concepts in business, economics, and finance and applies new concepts from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, risk management, and social impact measurements. Participants gain a foundational understanding of business development, the importance of intellectual property, and the value of community building as part of any business strategy - how solving for space is really about solving for problems on Earth. Guest speakers represent the private sector as well as groups such as NASA, the Space Force, and international space organizations.  Students leave with the tools to place an economic lens on the business, technology, and financing of spaceports, the aerospace industry, space adjacent technology, and the space economy as a whole.

CHMP BC0265,Chemical Connections and Happening,"Transferring electrons. Making and breaking chemical bonds. These are among the atomic- and molecular-scale happenings that we will explore in this course, combining discussions of chemical principles with hands-on laboratory experiments. \ This is an auspicious year for chemistry: 2019 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly and UNESCO as the International Year of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Dmitri Mendeleev’s publication of his periodic table. Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of “truth” in scientific theories. Curiosity and interest in chemistry are pre-requisites, but no special chemistry knowledge or background is required.

CINT PS0101,Cyber-Threat Intelligence,"Each year cybercriminals steal hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of information from major companies and vital national security secrets from governments, while terrorist organizations leverage cyber-networks for distributing their media and recruiting. It is imperative to nurture the next generation of intelligence professionals to understand the cyber-threat landscape given its ubiquitous impact on our daily lives.  In this course participants are exposed to cyber-threat intelligence as a discipline and its function in providing decision-makers with the support they need to stay abreast of evolving security challenges. Case studies on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and large cybercrime networks are examined so as to better understand their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); their successes; and their shortcomings. Further, we look at technology’s evolution and how it is integrated into our lives along with the likely future threat landscape that accompanies these technologies.  Threat intelligence encompasses more than the government, considering all private companies are reliant on technology and have their own threat intelligence teams, so this course focuses on both the public and private sectors.  Course readings cover the topics of intelligence, analysis, advanced persistent threat groups, cybercriminals, terrorist organizations, and the different methods these actors use to conduct their attacks and operations. We discuss these topics in greater depth in class lectures and with guest speakers. Students produce short white papers and work on group presentations in which they represent threat intel teams focusing on particular entities.

CLCV BC3000,"Ethnicity, Race, and Power: East Africa","This seminar explores the changing definitions and resonances of ethnic and racial categories in an ancient context. Over the course of the semester, we will explore how Nubians and Egyptians viewed one another as well as how both Egyptians and Nubians experienced and were experienced by groups who claimed a Hellenistic or a Jewish heritage. In all of these cases, as we will see, self-definitions and cultural boundaries shifted radically according to changing power dynamics both within groups and between them.  In the course of the seminar, we will pose the following questions: How and when did groups who saw themselves as distinct from one another cooperate and intermarry? Define themselves in opposition to other groups or actively blur boundaries? Mobilize concepts of ethnicity or race to justify oppression? Engage in competition or resistance? Where, we will ask, did societies fracture and/or integrate? And what role did bicultural individuals play in cultural conversations and mediations? We will also seek to understand how our conceptions of ethnicity and race in the past are influenced not only by the biases of the present but by the methodologies we employ. How, for instance, does what we learn from archaeology compliment or complicate understandings obtained through studies of art, literature, or documentary evidence? In our discussions and investigations this semester we will learn a great deal about Northeast Africa in antiquity – but, so too, about ethnicity, race, and power.",Ellen Morris,10:45am,12:20pm,00100,Barnard College,X3000-20212-001,EAST AFRICA IN ANTIQUITY,Classics @Barnard,CLCV,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLCV/X3000-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,,,3,,MTWR,20212CLCV3000X001,SEMINAR

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",John T Ma,9:00am,12:00pm,11194,Morningside,W3059-20212-001,WORLDS OF ALEXANDER THE G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLCV/W3059-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212CLCV3059W001,SEMINAR
CLCZ GU4035,THE WRITERS OF PRAGUE,"After providing an overview of the history of Prague and the Czech lands from earliest times, the course will focus on works by Prague writers from the years 1895-1938, when the city was a truly multicultural urban center. Special attention will be given to each of the groups that contributed to Prague’s cultural diversity in this period: the Austro-German minority, which held disproportionate social, political and economic influence until 1918; the Czech majority, which made Prague the capital of the democratic First Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938); the German- and Czech-speaking Jewish communities, which were almost entirely wiped out between 1938 and 1945; and the Russian and Ukrainian émigré community, which—thanks in large part to support from the Czechoslovak government—maintained a robust, independent cultural presence through the 1920s and early 1930s. Through close reading and analysis of works of poetry, drama, prose fiction, reportage, literary correspondence and essays, the course will trace common themes that preoccupied more than one Prague writer of this period. In compiling and comparing different versions of cultural myth, it will consider the applicability of various possible definitions of the literary genius loci of Prague.",Christopher W Harwood,1:00pm,4:10pm,10224,Morningside,W4035-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCZ,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLCZ/W4035-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212CLCZ4035W001,LECTURE

CLEN UN3398,THE MEDIEVAL VERSION,"The history of literature is in many ways a history of rewriting. Just as medieval writers sought inspiration in antiquity, so have writers since the Middle Ages recycled its stories and aesthetics for their own cultural moment. This course thus asks questions such as: what distinguishes “the medieval version” from antique precedents, and what can we learn about medieval culture from the juxtaposition of source and adaptation? In turn, what imaginative possibilities did the medieval world hold for later writers? Readings will range from Ovid to Chaucer, from Malory to Kazuo Ishiguro. We will focus on narratives in prose and verse. This course has a robust reading list, and since we are meeting in a compressed form, you should plan on reading approximately two hours per day to keep up with the assignments.",Hannah Weaver,1:00pm,4:10pm,12105,Morningside,W3398-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),CLEN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/W3398-20212-001/,702 Hamilton Hall,Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212CLEN3398W001,SEMINAR
CLEN UN3740,THE 30S: METROPOLE AND COLONY,"This course focuses on the tumultuous 1930s, which witnessed the growth of anticolonial movements, the coming to power of totalitarian and fascist regimes, and calls for internationalism and a new world vision. Even as fascism laid down its roots in parts of Europe, the struggle for independence from European colonial rule accelerated in Asia and Africa, and former subjects engaged with ideas and images about the shape of their new nations, in essays, fiction, poetry, and theater. Anti-colonialism also sparked debates about re-visioning gender relations, the place of minorities in the nation, religious difference and secularism, and models of world unity, among other issues. The course aims to consider the intersection of these debates with resistance to 1930s fascism: Did anti-fascist resistance in the metropole draw inspiration from anticolonial struggles? Conversely, did the spectre of fascism and authoritarianism present a cautionary tale to the project of nation-building in former colonies? We will read works from both the metropole and the colonies to track the crisscrossing of ideas, beginning with writers whose works foreshadowed the convulsive events of the 1930s and beyond (H.G. Wells, E.M. Forster, Rabindranath Tagore), then moving on to writers who published some of their greatest work in the 1930s (Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Mulk Raj Anand, M.K. Gandhi, Raja Rao, C.L.R. James), and concluding with an author who reassessed the events of the 1930s from a later perspective (George Lamming).

CLFR GU4321,The Maghreb in Transition: Society & Cul,"This course explores the production of culture in the contemporary Maghreb. We consider how important dimensions of social and political life are explored in literature and film and, correspondingly, the role that these and other media play in shaping social and political dynamics. The focus is on Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, but these nations are also situated in broader regional and global contexts. Former French colonies, these three nations  have in common a multilingual cultural environment in which French coexists with Arabic and Amazigh languages.     The course begins in roughly 1990, a time of disenchantment when the political regimes established at Independence were challenged and in some cases replaced. We explore the dynamics of Algeria’s ‘Black Decade’ and Morocco’s emergence from the ‘Years of lead,’ then turn to more recent social and political dynamics, notably the ‘Arab spring’ of 2011-2012 and the ongoing Algerian 
hirak
. Throughout the course we consider how the arts have responded to and contributed to change while also revisiting the past and reframing national narratives.     The course is interdisciplinary, combining historical, sociological and anthropological approaches with close reading of texts and films. The syllabus is organized both historically and thematically. We explore questions including the representation and memory of violence, the geographies and sociology of migration and globalization, and the changing landscape of media and publication. Several sessions explore the meaning of ‘modernity’ in conjunction with explorations of subjectivity and spirituality, gender and sexuality.",Madeleine Dobie,9:00am,12:10pm,12779,Morningside,G4321-20212-001,The Maghreb in Transition,Summer Session (SUMM),CLFR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLFR/G4321-20212-001/,517 Hamilton Hall,Hybrid,,3,,MW,20212CLFR4321G001,SEMINAR
CLFR OC3821,CITY DIPLOMACY,"Prerequisites: 
None.  
Eligibility: 
This course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students.  Based on a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, the city diplomacy course is designed to offer a general introduction to the international role of cities.  With its century-old history, city diplomacy represents a relatively recent dynamics in international relations. City diplomacy is generally considered to start in 1913 with the creation, at the Universal Exposition in the Belgian city of Ghent, of the first global city network, the Union Internationale des Villes.  Since its beginning, city diplomacy emerged as a field where cities’ values and idealism are implemented through a pragmatic and cooperative approach that progressively expanded its scope. The rise of such practice was driven by the desire to foster reconciliation among former enemies of the Second World War through direct interaction between residents in the framework of twinning agreements. A few years later, city diplomacy accompanied the process of decolonization by creating a solid bond of friendship between cities in former colonizing and colonized countries. In the 90s, city diplomacy widened its scope to include enhancing the city’s positioning in the global economy. Today, city diplomacy is best known for its impact in addressing the main transnational challenges (including climate change, migration, violent extremism, and urbanization) through a methodology featuring horizontal partnerships with cities from all over the world and a vertical, participatory approach engaging and empowering residents and local stakeholders.  Through an innovative approach cutting cuts across the boundaries of traditional disciplines (international relations, urban sociology, area studies, history, geography),  the course will combine the emerging scholarly literature with a comparative accent linked to the analysis of primary sources from cities and international actors from all regions of the world. As a result, students will learn to connect global and regional macro-dynamics with micro-transformations at the local level, while gaining an in-depth understanding of city diplomacy's core features, management, tangible impact, and evolution.  To enroll in this course, you must apply to the

CLMS PS0100,Global Climate Change and Public Policy,"Climate change is one of the world’s most critical challenges, and though quite prominent in today’s news it remains a complex and multifaceted issue. What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?  Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.  Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).

COMO PS0101,Geometric Topology: A Tool for Modeling,"Is the universe infinite or finite? What is the curvature and overall shape of the space we live in, and how might we detect this? Many have considered these questions throughout the ages, and while we still don’t know the answers, a field of mathematics called geometric topology has given rise to a relatively new framework for approaching them.  In this course, participants learn how models for topological spaces relate to theories on the shape of the physical universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds — structures that look one way up close but totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, flatness, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works — creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, with the help of a few video games, such as flying a space ship through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Participants gain, in addition to early exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",Joseph Quinn,3:10pm,5:00pm,10367,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Geometric Topology: Unive,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),COMO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/COMO/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212COMO0101KD01,LECTURE

CPLS GR6825,"Race, Caste and the University","B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.  This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, Rare Books and Manuscript Library Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.      This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and students will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research.",Anupama Rao,9:00am,12:10pm,10232,Morningside,G6825-20212-001,"Race, Caste and the Unive",Summer Session (SUMM),CPLS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/G6825-20212-001/,313 Hamilton Hall,Hybrid 20-79,,4,,MW,20212CPLS6825G001,SEMINAR
CPLS GU4802,Contradictions of Care: From Intimacy to,"Care is central to the interpersonal claim that is made by the other. It is a response that recognizes and satisfies a need. Care can be motivated by pain and sorrow, but also by desire and the desire for recognition. But while care is a fundamental aspect of healing, it can also be a demand that extracts obligations and liabilities. Care is an ambiguous concept that always already contains or is determined by its oppositions; we will begin by analyzing the concept of care itself, drawing on resources from the history and philosophy of medicine as well as literary sources. Ideals of care that many of us have for our loved ones are difficult to render at scale, and are often in tension with the for-profit motivations behind the development of medications, the administration of healthcare services, and the distribution of goods. We will consider the sorts of compromises that are made every day through readings in literature, history, political science and philosophy and also through first-person experience in the form of a practicum that that will run parallel to the course.",Arden A Hegele,9:00am,12:10pm,10231,Morningside,W4802-20212-001,CONTRADICTIONS OF CARE,Summer Session (SUMM),CPLS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/W4802-20212-001/,312 Mathematics Building,Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212CPLS4802W001,SEMINAR
CPLS GU4892,Subaltern Urbanism,"This seminar asks how spatial politics intersect with economic inequality and social difference (race, gender, caste, and ethnicity) to produce marginalized and stigmatized spaces such as “favelas,” “slum,” and “ghettos.”     The seminar draws on the convergent yet distinct urban trajectories of Bombay/Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro as a place from which to explore questions of comparative and global urbanism from an explicitly South-South perspective. That is, we ask how Bombay and Rio’s distinct yet connected urbanity might force us to alter our approaches to the city; approaches that are largely drawn from modular Euro-American paradigms for understanding urbanization as coeval with modernity, as well as industrialization. We do so in this seminar by focusing on people and practices—subaltern urbanity (and on those whose labor produced the modern city), as well as on spatial orders—the informal or unintended city—to ask the question: “what makes and unmakes a city?”     How might questions about built form, industrialization, capital flows, and social life and inhabitation that takes the perspective of “city theory from the Global South” shed new understanding on the history of the city, the extranational frames of colonial modernity, and the ongoing impact of neoliberalism? How can we rethink critical concepts in urban studies (precarity, spatial segregation, subalternity, economies of eviction, urban dispossession) through embedded studies of locality and lifemaking?",Anupama Rao,1:00pm,4:10pm,11383,Morningside,W4892-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),CPLS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/W4892-20212-001/,313 Hamilton Hall,Hybrid,,4,,MW,20212CPLS4892W001,SEMINAR

We will study how socially committed filmmakers have subverted and redefined cinema aesthetics to challenge authoritarianism and repression. In addition, we will look at how some filmmakers respond to institutional oppression, such as poverty and corruption, even within so-called “free” societies. The focus is on contemporary filmmakers but will also include earlier classics of world cinema to provide historical perspective. The course will discuss these topics, among others: What is authoritarianism, what is totalitarianism, and what are the tools of repression within authoritarian/totalitarian societies? What is Third Cinema, and how does it represent and challenge authoritarianism? How does film navigate the opposition of censorship, propaganda and truth? How do filmmakers respond to repressive laws concerning gender and sexual orientation? How do they deal with violence and trauma?

 course is designed to introduce students to a diverse set of contemporary media productions that
 are attuned to social, political, and cultural issues across the transpacific. Some of the topics
 discussed include race, gender, and sexuality in a networked world; migrant labor; indigenous
 rights; the ethics of new media; and, the intersections of media and social justice. Because this
 course takes on the study of media from a transpacific and global lens, it necessarily must

CSER UN3948,Indigenous Language Revitalization in La,"Why do Indigenous language matter? According to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, two Indigenous languages die every two months. Although Indigenous peoples make up less than 6% of the global population, they speak more than 4,000 of the world’s approximately 6,700 languages. This statistic indicates that the vast majority of the Indigenous languages are seriously endangered due to colonial practices, requiring urgent action for their maintenance and dissemination. This seminar examines the history and current state of Indigenous language revitalization in Latin America, focusing on Quechua in the Andes and the diversity of languages in the Amazon and Mesoamerica. It will approach the official and Indigenous grassroots language planning and policy initiatives.  Indigenous languages are not limited to the way Indigenous people communicate; they are an extensive and complex system of knowledge, history, memory, and identity. Therefore, this seminar will focus on how Indigenous people are reclaiming their languages, identities, and conveying their cultures through various methods and activities in rural and urban centers. These include oral traditions, educational pedagogies, music, art performances, and many other innovative efforts, for instance, using media and technological opportunities. The seminar will draw on a variety of academic literature and documentation materials produced by Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars and activists. Students will also have the opportunity to meet with Indigenous language speakers and teachers of the region. Select short films and Indigenous songs will be shown and discussed in class. This course is open to students from all departments interested in Indigenous language, culture, politics, literature, history, media, ethnomusicology, and anyone interested in expanding their critical sociocultural approach to Latin America.",Renzo Aroni,1:00pm,4:10pm,11501,Morningside,W3948-20212-001,Indigenous Language Revit,Summer Session (SUMM),CSER,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CSER/W3948-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,MW,20212CSER3948W001,SEMINAR

DEBA PS0101,Contemporary Debates in American Law and,"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the “front lines” of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.  A primary component of the course is devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Students then put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.  By the end of the course, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.

DIFI PS0207,Digital Filmmaking: From Initial Concept,"Participants learn all the basics of making a strong, visually-driven short film with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. The course focuses on the fundamentals of video production: essential film grammar, story development, script, music, and sound.  Working in small groups, students shoot three shorter pieces before collaborating to make a final film. The exercises start off simply, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment.  For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production participants learn how to work in a group to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production they work together to coordinate and shoot their script. And finally in post-production they edit and polish their projects. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.  The emphasis throughout the three weeks is on collaborative teamwork. Over the course of the various exercises, each student takes on a number of different roles within the production teams (director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor, sound). For the final projects, only a handful of proposals are selected for production, so not every participant directs or writes his or her own film, though everyone plays a crucial role in the production.  On the last day of the program, students screen their completed films at a film festival attended by friends, family members, and other program participants.

DRAW PS0100,Drawing Intensive: Developing a Portfoli,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  This course is aimed at developing a series of foundational drawings for a fine arts college-application portfolio.  Students explore various approaches to drawing from both observation and imagination while focusing on conceptually creative assignments. Each session develops the students’ approach to various materials, composition, and personal narratives into completed works that can be used for a final portfolio. Students have prolonged time to study and sketch the human figure from live nude models in class. Ideas are explored through assigned writings and developed in a sketchbook throughout the course.  A visit to a museum or gallery is scheduled as part of the course so as to facilitate discussion of relevant art historical concepts as well as contemporary approaches to drawing.  Lastly, participants learn how to prepare and digitally document works into a final portfolio for college applications.",Ioana I Manolache,1:10pm,4:00pm,10384,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,Developing a Portfolio,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DRAW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DRAW/K0100-20212-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212DRAW0100KD01,STUDIO

Taemong
 (birth dreams) of Korea to the sofas of Freud and Jung to contemporary Yanomami shamans and Hollywood’s 
Dreamworks
, throughout a vast array of cultures and eras, dreams have been a source of inspiration, healing, and insight. In this course we aim to reconnect with the imaginative power of dreams primarily by writing and interpreting our own, while reading extensively in dream literature.  While composing and sharing our own dreams on a daily basis with foremost attention to dreams as a source for discovery and literary artistic production, we experiment with a variety of compositional, mnemonic, and lucid techniques. Readings and audio-visual texts from writers, theorists, and filmmakers such as Patricia Garfield, Jeremy Seligson, Robert Moss (especially his “six masters of the ‘three only things’”), Joan of Arc, Lucrecia de León, Harriet Tubman, Mark Twain, Wolfgang Pauli, Winston Churchill, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Richard Linklater provide guidance and inspiration.",Loren S Goodman,3:10pm,5:00pm,10385,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),DREA,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Goodman,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/DREA/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212DREA0101ND01,LECTURE

EDUC BC3250,EDUCATION IN A POLARIZED AND UNEQUAL SOC,"The rise in political polarization and social inequality over the past few decades has challenged the ideals that public schools were founded on nearly two centuries ago. In the past few years, we have witnessed a surge in homophobic, racist, misogynist, and xenophobic rhetoric in our society and our schools. At the same time, teachers in classrooms across this country have been engaged in the difficult work of challenging oppression and injustice in their schools, communities, and nation. These teachers know that the future of our democracy is at stake. Using a historical and sociological framework, this course examines the past and present conditions that have led to political polarization, escalating inequality, and persistent injustice. It seeks to examine the lineage of racism, sexism, nativism, and imperialism on our nation and its schools and to consider the extent to which these challenges are uniquely American or part of a more global phenomenon. It offers an introduction to the deep current of American social, political, and economic culture that many argue has produced the challenges that our nation faces today: personal and political gain marred by intolerance, derived from wealth, and rooted in the history of segregation, sexism, and exploitation. Instead of seeing these challenges as separate entities, the course acknowledges the intersectional nature of power and politics. Students will consider how these conditions affect their roles as educators and the lives of the youth and families in their schools and communities. They will leave the course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the historical and sociological antecedents that have contributed to polarization, inequity, and injustice around the globe.",Erika Kitzmiller,9:00am,12:10pm,00030,Barnard College,X3250-20212-001,EDU IN POLARIZED/UNEQUAL,Education @Barnard,EDUC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EDUC/X3250-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20212EDUC3250X001,SEMINAR

Minerals come in dazzling colors, amazing shapes and with interesting optical effects. But mineralogy is also an essential tool for the understanding of Earth evolution. Minerals represent fundamental building blocks of the Earth system and planetary bodies. Minerals form through geological and biological processes such as igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary from high to low temperatures, from the deep interior to the Earth’s surface and related to volcanism, tectonics, weathering, climate and life. Minerals are one of our most important sources of information on such processes through Earth’s history. Minerals also represent important natural resources and are fundamental to the global economy and modern technology as we know it. The goal of this class is to (1) understand the physical and chemical properties of minerals, (2) learn techniques of mineral identification with an emphasis on optical mineralogy, (3) understand the relationship between minerals and the broader geological context.",Yves Moussallam,2:30pm,4:30pm,11003,Morningside,W4113-20212-001,INTRODUCTION TO MINERALOG,Summer Session (SUMM),EESC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/W4113-20212-001/,506 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],Hybrid,,4,,TR,20212EESC4113W001,LECTURE

EIPD PS0201,Entrepreneurship & Innovation: New Produ,"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.  With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University’s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.  Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.  Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another’s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",Michelle Greenwald,1:10pm,3:00pm,10392,Morningside,N0201-20212-D01,Entrepreneurship & Innova,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),EIPD,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EIPD/N0201-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212EIPD0201ND01,LECTURE

ELAW EL7041,Negotiations,"The Negotiation Workshop provides students with an experiential, simulation-based introduction to the theory and practice of negotiation. The course will consider such topics as integrative and distributive bargaining; barriers to agreement and ways to overcome them; negotiation skills such as listening, communication, and persuasion; the determinants of bargaining power; client relationships; negotiation ethics; and the role of culture, gender, and race in negotiation. Students will be expected to prepare for and take part in role plays, to keep a weekly journal in which they analyze their negotiation experiences, and to participate in a final project comprising a 60 to 90-minute one-on-one negotiation and a 10 page written analysis of that negotiation.   Because of the experiential and team-based nature of the coursework, class attendance is required. If you anticipate missing more than one class session, you should not take the course. Unanticipated absences due to illness or similar supervening circumstances will be accommodated as is reasonable; makeup activities may be required as part of the accommodation.

ENGL BC1021,FEMINIST LIFE WRITING,"Feminists have famously claimed that ""the personal is political."" Accordingly, life writing--in various genres--has been an important form for feminists across generations. In this class, we will explore the different ways in which feminists have used these modes to create visions of the self, to challenge the roles and self-images given to them, and to imagine new narratives. In particular, we'll explore questions of genre: so many of these writers have developed hybrid genres or challenged the boundaries of genre in order to write their lives. Looking at examples of life writing including letters, diaries and journals, graphic memoirs, and ""traditional"" autobiographies, we will examine these forms through the lens of gender, race, sexuality, class, and disability. Readings are subject to change, but may include: Audre Lorde, 
Zami
; Alison Bechdel, 
Fun Home
; Cherrie Moraga,
 Loving in the War Years
; Maggie Nelson, 
The Argonauts
; Maxine Hong Kingston,

; poems by Adrienne Rich; Carmen Maria Machado,

You will write three types of essays in this class, all of which will center personal experience as valuable evidence of larger phenomena or patterns. Your essays will build in complexity, as you introduce more types of sources into conversation about your topics as the semester goes on. You will hone your skills of observing, describing, questioning, analyzing, and persuading. You will be challenged to confront complications and to craft nuanced explorations of your topics. We will also regularly read and discuss the work of contemporary published essayists, identifying key writerly moves that you may adapt as you attempt your own essays.  You will have many opportunities throughout the semester to brainstorm ideas, receive feedback from me and your peers, and develop and revise your drafts.

We’ll also analyze literature and its relation to specific histories and cultures while mindfully engaging in the process of making. How does one write about the self by looking at the world? Is the imagination the most personal yet unknowable thing we have? In what ways do identity and personal history fit within our human narrative?

ENGL BC3169,RENAISSANCE DRAMA:1580-1642,"This class offers a general introduction to English drama at the moment when it arose as a major art form. In Renaissance London, astonishingly complex plays emerged that reflected the diverse urban life of the city, as well as the layered and often contradictory inner life of the individual. This poetically rich theater was less concerned with presenting answers, and more with staging questions—about gender, race, religion, literary tradition, love, sex, authority, and class. In this course, we will try to tap into this theater’s cosmopolitan, embodied poetics by reading not only Shakespeare, but also the various other major authors who constituted this literary world: Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, the ever-popular Anonymous and others.",Penelope Usher,9:00am,12:10pm,00092,Barnard College,X3169-20212-001,RENAISSANCE DRAMA:1580-16,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/X3169-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3169X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC3196,HARLEM RENAISSANCE LITERATURE,"In the summer of 2021,
 Home to Harlem
 will focus on the writing and collaboration of Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes in the 1920s. We will explore the cultural history and aesthetic debates that animated Harlem in the 1920s by reading them through the work (poetry, fiction, essays, plays) of Barnard and Columbia’s own, who, for a time juggled student life in Morningside Heights and the joys and challenges of being major players in the Harlem or New Negro Renaissance. Hurston and Hughes navigated the demands of being an artist and representative of ""the race"" in both similar and different ways. They worked together to shape the Renaissance according to their radical visions and were friends and collaborators until they famously fell out. The goal of this class is to plot the individual and collective artistic growth and experimentation of Hurston and Hughes, as well as create a digital timeline and rendering of their individual and collaborative development. To that end, this class will use either or both of the digital tools Scalar and Timeline.js in creative and collaborative ways. The class will partner with the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard for workshops on these digital tools that will be linked to all of the course assignments and final projects. No prior experience with these tools is necessary.",Monica L Miller,9:00am,12:10pm,00093,Barnard College,X3196-20212-001,HARLEM RENAISSANCE LITERA,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/X3196-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20212ENGL3196X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3207,THE 'GLOBAL' NOVEL,"""Yes, globalization can produce homogeneity, but globalization is also a threat to homogeneity."" --Kwame Anthony Appiah, ""The Case for Contamination,"" New York Times Magazine, 2006  Thinking through the arguments both in favor of and against globalization, particularly in the realm of cultural productions, in this course we will discuss the ""global"" novel. To that end, we will read essays from 
The Global Novel: Writing the World in the 21st Century
 about works such as 
Americanah, Snow,
 and 
The Reluctant Fundamentalist
 (along with the novels themselves) to investigate what is meant by ""global"" and what the criteria for including novels in this categorization are. We will also consider whether there is an erasure of cultural difference and nuance in reading novels using a globalizing perspective in order to render them more approachable for a (primarily) US audience.  In order to think through and challenge this category of the global, we will also read novels that can be roughly categorized as postcolonial. We will thus consider how struggles for independence and the desire to locate one’s identity either within freshly liberated nation-states or in the process of immigrating to former metropoles could give rise to cultural and psychological anxieties. We will also consider the manner in which late-stage capitalism could indeed push toward homogenized senses of self that manifest in a category such as the ""global novel"" and whether arguments could be made in favor of such homogenization. Ultimately, we will think about the politics of globalization and the desire to include in or exclude from the “global” certain locations, cultural products, or peoples.",Atefeh Akbari Shahmirzadi,1:00pm,4:10pm,00205,Barnard College,X3207-20212-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/X3207-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3207X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3291,FICTIONS OF LAW AND CUSTOM: WHITENESS IN,"This course examines ""white"" American identity as a cultural location and set of discourses and traditions with a history—in Mark Twain’s terms, ""a fiction of law and custom."" What are the origins of ""Anglo-Saxon"" American identity? What are the borders, visible and invisible, against which this identity has leveraged position and power?  How have these borders shifted over time, and in social and cultural space? How has whiteness located itself at the center of political, historical, social and literary discourse, and how has it been displaced?  How does whiteness mark itself, or mask itself, in literature and in larger cultural practices?  What does whiteness look like, sound like, and feel like from the perspective of the racial ""other""?

ENGL BC3291,FICTIONS OF LAW AND CUSTOM: WHITENESS IN,"This course examines ""white"" American identity as a cultural location and set of discourses and traditions with a history—in Mark Twain’s terms, ""a fiction of law and custom."" What are the origins of ""Anglo-Saxon"" American identity? What are the borders, visible and invisible, against which this identity has leveraged position and power?  How have these borders shifted over time, and in social and cultural space? How has whiteness located itself at the center of political, historical, social and literary discourse, and how has it been displaced?  How does whiteness mark itself, or mask itself, in literature and in larger cultural practices?  What does whiteness look like, sound like, and feel like from the perspective of the racial ""other""?

ENGL BC3913,SENIOR SEMINAR: BAD ROMANCE,"Romance: the quest for the one true love. This seminar will read romances that go wrong, that end catastrophically, that damage lovers or leave victims along the way. Reading bad romances will illuminate the consuming fantasy of the romance genre, as well as a range of emotions – rage and revenge, narcissism and self-protection, obsession and oblivion – that surface in their wake. We will also look at shifting interpretations of these powerful emotions, from Plato, to the Galenic theory of the humors, to the sociology of court-culture, to Freudian and finally contemporary neurobiological explanations of feelings. Students are welcome to propose texts of their own interests to open this course to the widest range of interests. Weekly individual tutorials with Professor Hamilton on weekends are offered but optional.  Readings: Euripides, 
Medea 
and Sophocles, 
Antigone.
 Malory, 
Sir Tristram de Lyonesse
 and Shakespeare, 
Othello.
 Mme de Lafayette, 
The Princesse de Cleves
. Emily Bronte, 
Wuthering Heights
. Miranda July, 
The First Bad Man
 and Curtis Sittenfield,

ENGL GR6913,TEACHING WRITING:THEORY & PRAC,"Prerequisites: the instructors permission. (Seminar). This course aims to contribute to your professional development while preparing you to teach University Writing, Columbia’s required first-year writing course. By the end of this course, you should have a basic grasp of the goals and structure of University Writing, the principles that inform its design, and the kinds of materials used in the course. While the course has an immediate goal—to prepare you for your fall teaching assignment—it aims simultaneously to enrich your teaching in the broadest sense. Your fall University Writing syllabus, as well as your lesson plans and homework assignments for the first eight classes, are due for review on August 1, 2016. This course will give you opportunity to prepare these materials throughout this semester with the support of the UWP directors, senior instructors, and advising lecturers. This course is the first of your ongoing professional development obligations as a UW instructor. You must successfully complete G6913 to teach in the UWP. Every subsequent semester, you will be required to attend a staff orientation, attend at least one workshop, and meet with your mentor and advising UWP director. All instructors new to the UWP must take this 1-credit, ungraded course during the fall of their first year of teaching. The course is intended to guide instructors through their first semester and emphasizes the practical application of the knowledge and expertise developed in G6913. Successful completion of the course is required for continuation as a UWP instructor.",Aaron Ritzenberg,9:00am,5:00pm,12108,Morningside,G6913-20212-001,TEACHING WRITING:THEORY &,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/G6913-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,"G6913

ENGL PS0101,Graphic Novels: Comics as an Art Form,"This course introduces students to a variety of contemporary comics and graphic novels, mostly from North America. Participants learn about the formal and aesthetic properties of such works by reading, analyzing, and discussing them. We focus on the complexities of reading visual-textual interactions, that is, on understanding the grammar of comics. We also consider the status of comics and graphic novels in both the literary and arts worlds.  Participants are expected to purchase and read a number of graphic novels for the class, one in advance of the session. They have the opportunity not only to learn from the texts themselves, but also to practice short, creative exercises helping them gain a better understanding of how comics tell stories. Finally, they learn from practitioners of the medium, through several guest lectures.  This course is useful for students interested in theories and practices of storytelling in varying forms.

On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.

ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,11093,Morningside,S3273-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3273-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3793,"19th-CENTURY    TRUE    CRIME, DETECTIVE","The nineteenth century saw the emergence of a modern police force, the birth of detective fiction, the appearance of dastardly criminals in the boulevard theatre, and the rise of tabloid “true crime” journalism. It is also the era that scholars often identify with “modernity” and the emergence of “mass culture.” This course will explore the convergence of these phenomena in England, France, the U.S., and the Australian subcontinent. We will examine accounts and images of nineteenth-century “true” crime, ranging from purportedly true representations to openly fictionalized ones. In addition to reading popular fiction, we will read trial reports, police memoirs, the autobiographies of those who embraced the underworld of crime, and narratives of prison life by those who saw its violence and dehumanization first-hand. We will examine a variety of nineteenth-century genres and visual media, including flip-book photographs, magic lantern shows, the “fantasmagorie,” the diorama and panorama, and early film. Throughout the course, our principal focus will be on primary sources: their relationship to the history they represent; their rhetorical, narrative, and visual choices and meanings; their significance for the history of crime and law.

ENGL S3851,PARADISE LOST,"This class will focus on John Milton’s 1667 epic poem about the creation of the world and the fall of humanity; Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel about a scientist’s creation of life; and Toni Morrison’s 1997 novel about a small, rural, all-black town in Oklahoma. In addition to the explicit echoes between these books, each work is interested in the relationship between the natural world and human beings; gender difference, relations between the sexes, and the reproduction of human life; and the bases of, and threats to, an ideal society. By reading these three works of art in sequence, we will thus look at how authors engage similar issues in different ways, paying particular attention to the role of of history, nation, genre, politics, literary tradition, and authorial identity. Finally, we will consider the ways in which authors’ revising, refuting, and re-envisioning of “source” texts affects our readings of the “source” texts as much as the new.",Julie Crawford,9:00am,12:10pm,11105,Morningside,S3851-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3851-20212-001/,614 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3851S001,LECTURE

ENGL S3915,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"“Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.”― Michel de Montaigne “There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard, The Writing Life “Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,11104,Morningside,S3915-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3915-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3915S001,SEMINAR

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

ENGL UN3328,EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: 1492-1852,"The class aims to provide a broad acquaintance with classic works of American literature from the period 1492-1852. The emphasis will be on literature produced before the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Most people grow up thinking of this date as the starting point of US history: “a new birth of freedom,” as Abraham Lincoln called it. And it was, in a way. But we will be trying to understand it differently: as an end-point of the chaotic, multinational, multicultural world that was North America before the USA existed.  Most of the texts composed during the first three centuries of American literature were written by authors who assumed that North America was destined forever to remain an outpost of the British, French, and Spanish empires. Before 1776, the Americans who most often dreamed of “declaring independence” were not white men in wigs, but rather enslaved people of African descent or members of Indigenous nations fighting to retain their sovereignty against the European empires. From these peoples’ perspective, the Revolutionary War did not bring an end to the “colonial period” of American history, as white Americans began telling themselves in the 1780s and 90s. According to early US nationalists like James Fenimore Cooper, America had already achieved freedom in a legal and political sense by the year 1800; now it just had to bring its culture up to speed. In reality, however, the ink on the Constitution had hardly dried before the USA became an empire in its own right. Freedom remained an unresolved problem that creators of American literature had to work through. That ongoing process, which began in the fifteenth century and continues today, is mainly what we will be studying.",Ryan Carr,1:00pm,4:10pm,11493,Morningside,W3328-20212-001,EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/W3328-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212ENGL3328W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3494,THE NOVEL OF SLAVERY,"In this course, we’ll be studying a subgenre of U.S. literature known as “the novel of slavery,” and we’ll be reading fictions by literary artists who attempted, in their various and distinctive ways, to come to terms with the atrocity of human bondage. In the first half of the course, we’ll read authors who wrote in the period before the legal abolition of slavery in the U.S., and whose works made direct contributions to the abolitionist cause. In the second half of the course, we’ll read authors who wrote in the years after the Civil Rights Movement, and whose works treated slavery as a historical phenomenon. But regardless of whether we’re discussing literature from the nineteenth century or the twentieth in our meetings, we’ll always be studying novels that condemn slavery as a legal, moral, and social institution; and that explore the wounds that slavery left upon individual and collective psyches; and that ask whether and how slavery’s tremendous wrongs could ever be redressed.",Austin Graham,9:00am,12:10pm,11106,Morningside,W3494-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/W3494-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212ENGL3494W001,SEMINAR

ENGL UN3746,ANCIENT ROME IN THE EARLY MODERN THEATER,"This course will investigate the powerful pull of ancient Rome on the artistic and political culture of early modern England. We will concentrate closely on representations of Rome as they appeared in the commercial theater at the opening of the seventeenth century, reading plays by William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, as well as masques (plays performed at court) by Ben Jonson. We will bolster our reading of this drama with an array of texts that grappled with ancient Rome through civic performance, English history, and politics, and we will explore how these ideas and ideals influenced emergent understandings of racial difference, and justifications of British imperial expansion. How, we will ask, did ancient Rome help the early modern English understand themselves: both, that is, who they were and who they weren’t?",Lauren E Robertson,1:00pm,4:00pm,11107,Morningside,W3746-20212-001,ANCIENT ROME IN THE EARLY,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/W3746-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212ENGL3746W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3789,AMERICAN NATURE WRITING TO 1900,"The course is a survey of canonical texts from the American Literary Canon, with emphasis on how these writers experienced the natural world. Some of them had to deal with extreme cold, others with tropical heat. Some of them encountered abundance, others sparsity and famine. They all encountered new life forms – from marine life to birds, reptiles and animals. They had to cope with frequent earthquakes and hurricanes, and classify newly discovered species of vegetal life. What they saw, however, was read not only through the lenses of natural history, but also theologically and politically. For some, the natural world was rich with signs sent by God for them to interpret, for others it was a political space that they organized according to the a theocratic or plantation logic. The class will therefore also pay special attention to politics, and investigate how the ecological spaces that the colonists encountered shaped their politics and ethics.",Branka Arsic,12:00pm,4:10pm,11182,Morningside,W3789-20212-001,AMERICAN NATURE WRITING,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branka_Arsi%C4%87,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/W3789-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,MW,20212ENGL3789W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3792,FILM AND LAW,"From its beginnings, film has been preoccupied with law: in cops and robbers silent films, courtroom drama, police procedural, judge reality show, or all the scenes that fill our media-saturated world. What do films and other audio-visual media tell us about what it’s like to come before the law, or about such substantive issues as what counts as murder, war crimes, torture, sexual abuse? How do films model the techniques that lawyers use to sway the passions of their audiences? How do they model the symbolism of their gestures, icons, images? If films and other audio-visual media rewrite legal events, what is their effect: on law? on legal audiences? How is the experience of being a film spectator both like and unlike the experience of being a legal subject? This course investigates such questions by looking at representations of law in film and other audio-visual media. We will seek to understand, first, how film represents law, and, second,how film attempts to shape law (influencing legal norms, intervening in legal regimes). The seminar’s principal texts will be the films themselves, but we will also read relevant legal cases and film theory in order to deepen our understanding of both legal and film regimes.  *Students should email Professor Peters (peters@columbia.edu

Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion

ENGL UN3851,INDIAN WRITING IN ENGLISH,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. (Seminar). As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Mahasweta Devi, Bapsi Sidwa, Rohinton Mistry, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy.

ENGL W3595,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL: GENRE AND,"In the late seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel.  It told the stories – not of the princes and princesses – but of ordinary people on extraordinary voyages, from villages to the Metropolis, from England to Africa and the Americas. In their travels, they encountered not the dragons or giants of romance, but the people and things that made up everyday life in the eighteenth century – country houses and whorehouses, aristocrats and the merchants, pirates and slaves, and a vast array of enticing goods (shoes and coats, silks and ribbons, coffee and opium) produced in early capitalism.  Why does the novel appear?  What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society?  Can we account for its increasing popularity as well as its transformations across the eighteenth century?  To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.  Writers include Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Eliza Heywood, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, William Godwin, and Jane Austen. Critical readings include selections from Benjamin, Adorno,
 Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.  Note: we will read primarily novellas (short novels) or selections from longer novels in this course.",Ross T Hamilton,1:00pm,4:10pm,12552,Morningside,S3595-20212-001,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NO,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3595-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212ENGL3595S001,SEMINAR

ENGP BC0101,Citizen Sleuth: Writing Compelling True,"Bring your love of truth, justice, mystery, and New York City history to this writing class. Studying the elements of the city’s well-known, and not so well-known crimes, can open a lens into the race, class, and gender structures at work in our metropolis, and reveal whom they benefit, and whom they harm. The current explosion in True Crime books, podcasts, blogs, and documentaries, and the fact that women are taking control of more of these narratives cannot be ignored. Students will choose an actual criminal case from New York’s recent or not so recent history (e.g. Typhoid Mary), and write a nonfiction story driven by their point of view, which will emerge from shorter pieces and research done during the class. The coursework will cover best writing practices, such as learning the skills of legally sound, ethical reporting, interviewing people on sensitive matters, and using public records—all in the interest of uncovering and shaping the raw material into a story that needs to be told, for victims who may not always have the tools to tell them. Readings will include Michelle McNamara’s I’ll Be Gone in The Dark, Becky Cooper’s We Keep the Dead Close, James Polchin’s Indecent Advances, and excerpts from Christopher Payne’s photography book, North Brother Island, the Last Unknown Place in New York City. We will take virtual tours of public archives, the Museum of the City of New York, Central Park, and The East River, listen to Laci Mosley’s Scam Goddess, and view documentaries and films such as Strong Island, The Witness (about Kitty Genovese), and Summer of Sam.

ENGP BC0102,"Poetry Writing Workshop: The Poem, The S","In this poetry writing workshop, students will explore the poem as a place for expressing what is essential about the self—and as a process for discovering the truth. The study of a variety of poetic forms will reveal how each offers a framework for clarifying one’s own understanding of the world on the way to inviting readers to share it. Class time will consist of workshops and close readings of exemplary poems. My workshop approach focuses on developing a safe and supportive climate for feedback in which we practice how to respond in ways that respect the goals and intentions of the poet as well as how to receive feedback with an open mind and confident heart. Afternoon special sessions will also feature craft talks and readings by other award-winning contemporary poets, followed by Q&A with students. During office hours, students will receive individual poetry consultations—focused on helping their poems be the poems they want them to be. At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of poems ready to submit to journals, contests, and writing programs.

What happens when women of color take on such tropes as space exploration, cybernetics, superpowers, and the end of the world? How can women of color change the way we not only think of the future, but think of the present as well? In this class we’ll look at how speculative literature looks at the intersections of race, gender, class, sexuality, technology, and environmental concerns.

ENID PS0101,Entrepreneurship: From Idea to Early Des,"This intensive ten-session course takes an applied, practical approach to the development, testing, and validation of customer or community-driven product solutions. By learning and applying contemporary design-thinking concepts and tools, students generate innovative solutions to important customer or community problems. During the program, students identify and define a major problem to be solved, work with real customers to better understand the problem from their perspective, generate multiple solutions, then choose a solution to test with real customers. Students acquire practical knowledge and tools focusing on the development, testing, and validation of new products that solve real customer problems and needs, from idea to early product development.  Students can expect to learn how to:  
  
identify and articulate customer problems in an accurate way, reflecting how individuals truly experience the problem and its challenges
  
create effective customer surveys to help validate your assumptions on customer problems (pain points), solutions, and benefits (expected outcomes)
  
assess current solutions provided in the marketplace in order to build on best practices as well as identify gap areas
  
develop a minimal viable product in order to gain additional feedback on specific solution features

ENIN PS0201,Entrepreneurship & Innovation: Changing,"Intended for students interested in creating new business ventures or social enterprises, this hands-on course focuses on the creation, evaluation, development, and launch-readiness of new business or social ventures. Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format. For each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.  Students work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class, they refine their venture’s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.

ENLW PS0101,Law at the Cutting Edge of Technology,"This class explores the application of legal principles to advancements in technology, including social media, drones, video games, cryptocurrency, and smartphone apps. In learning about these particular topics, students gain a more general understanding of some of the most important concepts underlying much of U.S. law.
 
 We analyze the law of nuisance and trespass through the lens of Pokemon Go, and we look at the legal concept of negligence by examining product liability issues arising from injuries related to autonomous vehicles and SnapChat filters. The class then explores how the right to privacy is impacted in the physical world by drone technology, and how privacy interests are impacted in the digital world by data gathering platforms such as Facebook. We look at legal issues having to do with the future of money, gaining a basic understanding of blockchain and its role in cryptocurrency and fractional asset ownership through tokenization. Finally, through a study of “influencer” marketing, we explore advertising, marketing, and contract law through a case study of the infamous Fyre Festival.
 
 Students learn through a combination of lecture, discussion, debate, and group work. Content and learning examples are presented in various forms, including PowerPoints, short videos, images, in-class demonstrations, and a guest speaker. Students complete a culminating project involving an oral small group presentation.
 
 Through this immersive learning experience, participants gain a broad understanding of the law as well as enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills. They learn how to approach complex, dynamic legal problems and methodically analyze all relevant factors so as to arrive at logical, evidence-based results. Further, they practice collaborative co-creation and public speaking as they work in small groups on their culminating oral presentations.",Hilary Silvia,3:10pm,5:00pm,10397,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Law at Cutting Edge of Te,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ENLW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENLW/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ENLW0101KD01,LECTURE
ENTA UN3970,MAJOR 20TH CENTURY PLAYWRIGHTS,"The course will trace the pattern of the evolving theatrical careers of Henrik Ibsen and Harold Pinter, exploring the nature of and relationships among key features of their emerging aesthetics. Thematic and theatrical exploration involve positioning the plays in the context of the trajectories of modernism and postmodernism and examining, in that context, the emblematic use of stage sets and tableaux; the intense scrutiny of families, friendships, and disruptive intruders; the experiments with temporality, multi-linearity, and split staging; the issues raised by performance and the implied playhouse; and the plays' potential as instruments of cultural intervention. Two papers are required, 5-7 pages and 10-12 pages, with weekly brief responses, and a class presentation. Readings include major plays of both writers and key statements on modernism and postmodernism.

This course is open to undergraduates students, and visiting students.  The Summer Ecosystem Experiences for Undergraduates (SEE-U) program provides an academic experience that is open to all undergraduate majors and which focuses on a global understanding of ecology and environmental sustainability. The SEE-U program gives you the opportunity to participate in a combination of lectures and labs, while conducting environmental fieldwork in unique natural settings around the world.  Perhaps the single most pressing challenge humanity faces this century is how to sustainably produce and distribute food to an ever-growing, increasingly urbanized population. Nearly two-thirds of the ecosystems of the world have been converted or are managed to provide food, fuel, and fiber for our current population of 7.2 billion people. Over 44% of land in the United States, for example, is already under cultivation; yet, over 12 million children in our country suffer from hunger and one in seven households suffer from food insecurity. By 2050, the world’s population is expected to increase by 2 to 3 billion people, and there is considerable research and debate on whether we can sustainably feed humanity without jeopardizing environmental sustainability.  The SEE-U NYC program provides students an opportunity to examine agroecosystems through exploring the diverse array of farms and food systems in New York City and its surrounding environs. Lectures introduce students to the foundations of ecology and conservation, focusing on agroecosystems which include: farms, rooftop gardens, hydroponic systems, pastures, community gardens, and plantations. The course also covers food systems, or “food to fork” pathways. Lectures at Columbia University with field excursions and lab exercises allow students to apply ecological concepts to real-world examples of agroecosystems. Weekly field trips include visits to farms and gardens within the city and rural farms and dairies outside of the city to expose students to the breadth of local and regional agroecosystems and food systems.

EPID P8443,Microbiome & Health,"The course will provide an introduction to the microbiome and will discuss the role of microbiome in human health. Microbiome refers to the collective community of microbes (e.g. bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi) and the function of their genomes. The number of studies related to microbiome has grown recently, coinciding with interest from the public and media in the potential of the microbiome to affect human health. The goal of this course is to provide background on important concepts related to microbiome and methodological issues common in epidemiological studies of microbiome. Concepts related to microbial ecology, gut biogeography, relationship with nutrition and metabolism, and how various factors including life stages affect the microbiome will be covered. The course will also focus on epidemiologic methods for gut microbiome studies including a focus on study design, implementation, and analysis along with a discussion on potential threats to causal inference. The concepts and methods learned will then be applied to various topics of microbiome and health (gastrointestinal diseases, infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes, obesity and environmental health).",Rupak Shivakoti,10:00am,11:20am,12685,Presbyterian Hospital,P8443-20212-001,,Epidemiology,EPID,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EPID/P8443-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212EPID8443P001,LECTURE
EPID P8484,INTRO TO ADV EPI METHODS,"This is a 1.5 credit course designed for students who have successfully completed the Columbia Summer Research Institute (CSRI) program which provides an introduction to the conceptual foundation and application of advaned epidemiologic analysis methods. The course will take place over five 4-hour sessions conducted on Zoom. Each session will cover multiple analysis topics and will begin with a lecture introducing the analysis methods including descriptions of their relationship to causal inference and a discussion with examples of the types of study designs and data the methods can be used with. Following the lecture will be a lab session in which students will use SAS to conduct exercises to give them hands on experience implementing the anlytic techniques (datasets and example code will be provided). Lab sessions will include individual and breakout group work. Assignments will include readings, labs (which will not be graded), short quizes on the analysis methods, assignments and a final project in which students will develop an analytic plan, conduct a data analysis ans present findings (students can use their own or a course-provided dataset).",,,,12959,Presbyterian Hospital,P8484-20212-010,,Epidemiology,EPID,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EPID/P8484-20212-010/,,On-Line Only,,1.5,,,20212EPID8484P010,LECTURE

ETHI PS0201,Introduction to Philosophical Enquiry: E,"Most broadly, ethics is concerned with how it is best for us, as human individuals and communities, to live – how we understand and relate to ourselves, each other, and beyond. What goals or values should we pursue? What kinds of lives are good and worthy of choice (for anyone)? What moral duties do we have – are there individual actions or social policies which are (morally) required or forbidden? And to whom or what do we owe them – in virtue of what do entities have moral standing? Is acting morally good for us and, if so, would this compromise the ethical worth of so acting? What is the source of our knowledge, if any, about these matters, and how do we resolve conflicting answers to these questions?   While attending some to ‘meta-ethics’, the course focuses on normative ethics and its application. After an introduction to philosophical and ethical inquiry and an orientation in foundational ethical questions, the course surveys several approaches to ethics – consequentialism (especially utilitarianism), rule- or duty-based theories (particularly ‘Kantianism’ and ‘contractualism’), and some of the traditions of ‘virtue ethics’. The course then applies these theories to several concrete topics, including the distribution of material resources in society, sex and gender, race and racism, and free speech.   Our authors include Audre Lorde, Immanuel Kant, John Rawls, John Stuart Mill, Kongzi (Confucius), Peter Singer, Plato, Robin S. Dillon, Susan Moller Okin, and W.E.B. Du Bois.   The course has three main goals for students: 
1
) To describe, explain, and provisionally assess some important philosophical perspectives – historical and contemporary, Western and non-Western – on ethics; 
2
) To identify, logically analyze and evaluate, and construct (logically valid and sound) philosophical arguments; 
3
) To use spoken and written language clearly, concisely, and convincingly.   There are no prerequisites for the course. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10398,Morningside,N0201-20212-D01,Ethics,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ETHI,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ETHI/N0201-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ETHI0201ND01,LECTURE
ETPH PS0100,The Ethics of Tech,"This course probes the evolving ethical, political, and social questions that have begun to emerge as a result of rapid technological transformations in the 21st Century.  Students are introduced to selections of classical moral and political philosophy, which provides a critical vocabulary for discussing a broad range of concerns that have animated the emerging field of tech and ethics. We discuss issues associated with AI, algorithmic bias, data and privacy, free speech and content regulation, and antitrust claims against tech giants, among other topics. Participants debate specific issues and write sample policy reports based on case studies.",Michelle Chun,3:10pm,5:00pm,10399,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ETPH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ETPH/K0100-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ETPH0100KD01,LECTURE

FASH PS0101,Fashion Design: Focus on New York City S,"In this course students explore fashion with a particular focus on style and culture in New York City and then develop their own designs.  Participants get a first-hand look at the field through discussion with active figures in the fashion industry such as designers, marketing directors, and stylists. They take virtual field trips to locations such as the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Readings on the history, theory, and culture of fashion include works by icons, artists, writers, editors, philosopher, and activists such as Diana Vreeland, Susan Sontag, Oscar Wilde, Bernard Rudofsky, and Marilyn Bender. As a springboard for inspiration and discussion, we view the works of a variety of designers through film clips and videos. Through our explorations into fashion as art we encounter individuals who live and enact fashion through performative dress, at times challenging social and gender expectations  Having gained a firm grounding in the field, participants research and formulate their own original fashion concepts. Based on these concepts, they design their own unique collections. Concepts may center on a particular motif (e.g., technology as an extension of the human body), period or style (e.g., British monarchy, Imperial China, Ancient Egypt, imagined future, underwater or deep space), or material inspiration (e.g., mylar, fiber optics, recyclables, etc.). While sharing sources of inspiration and research discoveries with attention to both craft and theory, in addition to producing our individual collections, we engage in a collaborative design project.",Eva Goodman,3:10pm,5:00pm,10400,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Fashion Design: NYC Style,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),FASH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FASH/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212FASH0101KD01,LECTURE

The main focus is cinema in the expanded field, and its themes and aesthetics are examined in relation to a wide variety of topics— from early computer art to database aesthetics, virtual and augmented realities, interactivity, immersion, and technical failure. Students will read widely in theories ofdigital cinema and related new media (Manovich, Shaviro, Patterson) as well as considering how older theory (Heidegger, Godard) is relevant to the contemporary moment.

FILM BC3250,ADAPTATION,"In the same way that there can never be a single objective account of an historical event, using one medium to convey a story first told in another is never as straightforward as it might seem. Translating the essence of an existing story to the screen may require making significant changes to the events or characters as they were originally presented. As a screenwriter faced with such an adaptation, you must understand the idiosyncrasies of your craft well enough to recognize what to keep, what to change, and what to leave behind.

FILM GU4305,Digital Storytelling I,"What does interaction have to do to storytelling? How do we tell stories within media that are non-linear, including games, virtual reality, and immersive theater? How can we craft narratives that emerge from the dynamics of interaction, narratives experienced through exploration and choice? What design strategies exist regarding an understanding of character, plot, drama, time, space, and event within interactive fictions? This course will take a close look at the mechanics of storytelling within dynamic media, exploring connections between interactivity and narrative experience. The course will examine examples ranging from the design of Live Action Role Playing games to massively multi-player experiences, from hypertext to tarot cards, from Oculus to Punchdrunk.  Given the necessity of a digital class environment, the course will be conducted on Zoom for class time. Students will be expected to have cameras active and be in environments in which they can speak during class. The class will also use an online whiteboard system called Miro, and students will be expected to be on Miro during class time. Links for these online tools are permanent and can be found here:

FILM GU4951,NEW MEDIA ART,"The rapid democratization of technology has led to a new wave of immersive storytelling that spills off screens into the real world and back again. These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape. New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester well explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia’s Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings. It is in the interaction between these two perspectives that the course will explore the parameters of emerging frontiers in media art and the challenges these pose for existing critical vocabularies.",,9:00am,12:00pm,11285,Morningside,W4951-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/W4951-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212FILM4951W001,SEMINAR
FILM PS0100,Understanding Cinema: Analyzing Film Lan,"This course introduces students to the art and analysis of cinema through examination of works by filmmakers ranging from Orson Welles to Martin Scorsese. Readings, screenings, the analysis of clips and full-length movies, as well as hands-on exercises such as storyboarding, blocking, shooting, and editing a scene all combine to convey the excitement and artistry of film.
 
 Week One:
 
 Students learn how motion pictures developed their own language—their own, universally understood visual system of representation—by studying the masters of early and contemporary cinema: the edge-of-your-seat last minute rescue scenes of D.W. Griffith; the bravura long takes of Jean Renoir; the nail-biting tension created by Quentin Tarantino; and the nerve-tingling suspense that is the hallmark of Alfred Hitchcock. Beginning with a storyboard, students will try their hand at conceptualizing a scene from start to finish in the style of classical Hollywood cinema.
 
 Week Two:
 
 Having learned Hollywood’s tricks of the trade, we branch out into international cinema, where other nations developed different systems of representation—their own languages—that challenged but also inspired the American film industry. Meet the Soviet style of filmmaking that revolutionized cinema in every sense of the word; the Gothic excess of German Expressionism, whose use of lighting, setting, and costume echoes in all contemporary horror flicks; and the bold surrealism of Luis Buñuel, Salvador Dali, and Maya Deren, whose cinematic experiments impact on dream sequences to the present day. Each student writes a review of one contemporary American film that owes a debt to foreign cinema—or vice versa.
 
 Week Three:
 
 Putting it all together, Week Three culminates in group analyses of some of the masterworks of classical and contemporary cinema such as Citizen Kane, Run, Lola, Run and La La Land. We examine and discuss the ways in which sound and image, editing, and the elements of mise-en-scène combine to create transporting cinematic experiences that have the ability to make audiences cry, experience fear, feel empathy and joy and, above all, marvel at the magic of movies.
 
 Daily readings include film reviews and essays on film analysis, technique and history. Students are also responsible for an oral presentation on a specific scene, film, or director of their choice.

FINC PS0202,Introduction to Socially Responsible Inv,"There is no denying the significant growth in the focus on Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) Investing that has taken place over the past few years, with trends around climate change leading the charge. What was once deemed a public value focal point has blossomed into a prudent investment strategy as research has indicated that companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainable business practices, in the long-run, outperform those that do not. The result has been a mass migration towards ESG and Impact investing.  This course is an introduction to socially responsible investing and an overview of the differences between ESG and Impact Investing. We investigate the relationships between ESG investing, outperforming market returns, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals.  The materials presented in class as well as class discussions empower students to answer questions such as:  
  
How can investing be reconciled with sustainability and achieving the sustainable development goals?
  
Will ESG investing become the norm rather than the exception?
  
What are the links between green finance and ESG investing?
 
  Through a mix of introductory finance and asset management theories, class colloquia, and investment case studies, students gain an understanding of the challenges and opportunities embedded in sustainable investing.",Isabelle Marie  F Delalex,1:10pm,3:00pm,10405,Morningside,K0202-20212-D01,Socially Responsible Inve,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),FINC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FINC/K0202-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,Pre-College Programs,0,,MTWRF,20212FINC0202KD01,LECTURE

 This course covers a range of artworks from various periods in Western art, beginning with Renaissance painting and concluding with contemporary art. Students learn about the materials and techniques that artists use as well as the historical contexts in which they operate. While we look closely at specific artworks using the tools of formal analysis, we also discuss the different methodologies art historians use to interpret the social and cultural meanings these artworks contain.The goal of this class is to examine artworks while encouraging students to think about the choices that artists make as well as how these objects reflect and embody their specific cultures and time periods.

 Architecture and Society: New York’s Built Environment
 This course introduces students to the visual analysis of architecture. Instead of surveying the history of architecture, we look at specific New York landmarks so as to understand how great structures not only fulfill practical needs but also influence our relationship to the physical and social world around us. By studying some of the city's notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. Students become familiar with basic architectural vocabulary (such as light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same elements to different ends.
 
 We examine historical and current images of key buildings and places, discuss their essential role in urban life, and identify significant events which have made them memorable. We also consider how their portrayal in popular culture has contributed to New York’s identity and image as an American city and a global destination.
 
 Some of the sites we consider typically include Columbia University’s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9/11 Memorial.",Nenette Arroyo,1:10pm,3:00pm,10408,Morningside,N0205-20212-D01,Architecture & Society,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),FOVA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FOVA/N0205-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212FOVA0205ND01,LECTURE

We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City.

The goal of FREN UN3405 is to help students improve their grammar and perfect their writing and reading skills, especially as a preparation for taking literature or civilization courses, or spending a semester in a francophone country. Through the study of two full-length works of literature and a number of short texts representative of different genres, periods, and styles, they will become more aware of stylistic nuances, and will be introduced to the vocabulary and methods of literary analysis. Working on the advanced grammar points covered in this course will further strengthen their mastery of French syntax. They will also be practicing writing through a variety of exercises, including pastiches and creative pieces, as well as typically French forms of academic writing such as “résumé,” “explication de texte,” and “dissertation.",Sophia Mo,9:00am,11:05am,11348,Morningside,W3405-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),FREN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/W3405-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,"FREN UN3333

What are the historical linkages between black Americans and Paris? Between black Americans and black French women and men? How is this relationship different from and contingent on the relationship between the “French” and their colonial “others?” How is “blackness” a category into which all non-white racial others are conscripted? (e.g. Arab and Roma communities)?

GRKM GU4020,PUBLIC HELLENISM,"The Practicum's participants will be registered for the course ""Public Hellenism,"" which will meet daily from 10:00-11:00 (with the exception of a few days when it will meet 10:00-12:00). This course consists of three parts.The first part (weeks 1 and 2) introduces students to public humanities and Greek history and culture, is structured around an examination of 
SNFPHI projects currently underway in Greece
, and draws on the materials that these projects have produced (films, guides of best practices, theoretical texts).  The second part of the course (weeks 3 and 4) is structured around workshops (on oral history, zines, archives, podcasts, online exhibitions, and game design) conducted in collaboration with Columbia programs and initiatives. These workshops are meant to provide students with the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue their own projects and to introduce them to the methods used by public humanities practitioners to connect with broad audiences. In the course's third part (weeks 5 and 6), students will work on their own projects while taking turns leading discussions with SNFPHI project leaders in Greece, Columbia faculty, and fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris. These discussions will give students an opportunity to explore the various ways in which public humanities are practiced and also receive feedback and advice for their own projects.  Throughout the course students are expected to dedicate to the Practicum 2-3 hours per day (including class time). Evaluation will be on the basis of: participation (30%); a 400-500-word project proposal (10%); the final project (30%); and a 800-1000 word how-to guide detailing the theoretical and practical parameters of a project from its conceptualization to its implementation (30%).  
Course Objectives
: Students can expect to develop a foundation in Greek history, anthropology, politics, and art; exercise skills in close reading, critical thinking, and intellectual debate; engage issues in social justice, democracy, and community building, while developing skills for civic-minded work outside academia.  To enroll in this course, you must apply 
Virtual Columbia Summer Practicum in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies
 through the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).

GRKM S3935,HELLENISM AND THE TOPOGRAPHICA,"Course Overview: This course examines the way particular spaces—cultural, urban, literary—serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on the themes of the polis, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces—complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages—and ask: To what extent is meaning and cultural identity, site-specific? How central is the classical past in Western imagination? How have great metropolises such as Paris, Istanbul, and New York fashioned themselves in response to the allure of the classical and the advent of modern Greece? How has Greece as a specific site shaped the study of the Cold War, dictatorships, and crisis?",Dimitris Antoniou,1:00pm,4:10pm,11198,Morningside,S3935-20212-001,HELLENISM AND THE TOPOGRA,Summer Session (SUMM),GRKM,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/GRKM/S3935-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212GRKM3935S001,LECTURE

HIST BC3825,"RACE, CASTE, AND THE UNIVERSITY: B. R. A","B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.     This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, Rare Books and Manuscript Library Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.  This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R.

HIST BC3842,Subaltern Urbanism: South Asia,"This course asks how spatial politics intersect with economic inequality and social difference.  The course draws on the convergent yet distinct urban trajectories of cities in the global South (Bangalore; Bombay/Mumbai; Lahore; New Delhi; Dhaka) as an enabling location  for exploring broader questions of comparative and global urbanism from an explicitly South-South perspective.  That is, we ask how distinct yet connected urban forms might force us to alter our approaches to the city; approaches that are largely drawn from modular Euro-American paradigms for understanding urbanization as coeval with modernity, as well as industrialization. We do so in this seminar by focusing on people and practices—subaltern urbanity (and on those whose labor produced the modern city), as well as on spatial orders—the informal or unintended city—to ask the question: “what makes and unmakes a city?”  How might questions about built form, industrialization, capital flows, and social life and inhabitation that takes the perspective of “city theory from the Global South” shed new understanding on the history of the city, the extranational frames of colonial modernity, and the ongoing impact of neoliberalism?

HIST GR8861,INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS,"This course provides an introduction to the methods, issues and debates that shape our understanding of economic change and development in the period from the late eighteenth century to eve of the Great Depression of the 1930s as they affected both early and late developing economies. This course is designed both for students specializing in economic history and students in all disciplines interested in historical approaches to political/economic development.  You do not need a background in economics to fully participate in the discussions and written work that will form the basis of this course.  We will arrange a special session on empirical analysis pertinent to this area of study, to be conducted by the Barnard Empirical Reasoning Center.   We have organized the material for this course into four broad sections.   Most will include two or three reading sets focusing on specific topics for discussion over two 
 (and in some instances one) class meetings.  Although the course extends over only six weeks, we have incorporated all of the themes we cover during a normal term and have provided lists of supplemental readings that we hope will allow you to dive even more deeply into those areas of inquiry that contribute to your own research and teaching agendas.     This course deals with a large literature and one that draws from many regional histories. Course participants, including the faculty, come from different disciplinary backgrounds and specialize in different regional histories as well. Our goal is to provide a foundation from which you can develop your own approaches to economic development in the period beginning in the eighteenth century. At the same time, we hope to take advantage of your diverse interests to develop a collaborative reading list that goes beyond our own expertise. This is reflected in the course requirements, which allow you to dig more deeply into those areas that most interest you while benefiting from the overall discussion of the broader field of industrial development.",,10:45am,12:20pm,10263,Morningside,G8861-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/G8861-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,MTWR,20212HIST8861G001,COLLOQUIA

HIST GU4200,Free/Unfree Labor: East Central Europe,"The emancipation of serfs in Prussia, Habsburg monarchy and tsarist Russia (1780s to 1860s) coincided with the abolition of slavery in trans-Atlantic world. All over the globe, the acts of emancipation spurred political resistance, social movements, state actions, and economic policies that targeted former serf/slaves and generations of their descendants. What to do with the newly granted freedom animated social movements and ruling elites, entrepreneurs and peasants, national leaders and women activists.  The abolition of serfdom and its historical significance in the particular context of eastern and central Europe is the keynote of the seminar. We will focus on pivotal issues of the post-emancipation modernity: unfree/free labor, industrial and agrarian development; mass emigration vs. access to ethnic nationalism. We will analyze politics of class, race and ethnicity from the Enlightement to the establishment of the Communist rule. The seminar asks: what happened to people and lands they inhabited in the wake of enserfed labor?

We will also read two national histories written through the lens of football and think about how cultural ideas of sex and gender determine the course of sport history and vice versa. The course is structured around readings and discussion sections and will culminate in a final research paper.

HIST S3123,CENSORHSP/FREEDOM-EXPRESS-EURO,"In this course we examine theoretical and historical developments that gave rise to notions of censorship and free expression in early modern Europe. The role of censorship has become one of the significant elements in discussions of early modern culture. The new technology of printing, the rise national political cultures and their projections of control, religious wars and denominational schisms are some of the factors that intensified debate over the free circulation of ideas and speech.   We will analyze categories of prohibited speech such as political, religious, and offensive to civil society. We will look at the mechanisms of censorship: who served as censors? How consistently was censorship applied? How effective was censorship in suppressing unwanted expression? What were its unintended consequences? We will look at ways in which censorship triggered significant reaction, such as martyrdom or created a culture of dissimulation, such as marranism and nicodemism.  Index, Inquisition, Star Chamber, book burnings and beheadings have been the subjects of an ever growing body of scholarship. Finally, we will ask whether early-modern censorship can be said to have had a constitutive role in the formation of modern culture.

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"Even before the U.S. existed as a republic, people from 'Hispanic' and Indo-America have been incorporated into the culture, history, life, and occupational fabric of the United States. Yet, forces, figures, and factions in larger society frequently perceived Latin American heritage people as members of an 'alien' culture. Through histories of coercion, migration, labor recruitment, family networks, religious conversion, wars of occupation, economic need, political exile, education inequities, electoral participation, and unimaginative representations in film, fiction, and broader popular culture, millions of people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, and the rest of Latin America have somehow become American, while still remaining outside the national community. This 3-point undergraduate lecture course will examine the process of departure and arrival-the historical forces pushing and pulling people from Latin America to the United States. We will also examine how 'Spanish,' 'Latins,' 'Hispanics,' and 'Latinos' adjust, integrate, assimilate, resist, and adapt to the many forces that affect their lives in the U.S. over the last century and a half, creating new ethnic, racial and local identities in the process. By studying the experience of Latinos/as and Latin American immigrants with an eye toward patterns of second-class citizenship, identity formation, ethnic culture, community maturation, labor struggles, and social mobility, we will map out the heterogeneous mosaic of Latin American and Caribbean diasporas in the U.S. Due in large part to ongoing immigration from Mexico, the Mexican-origin population has grown appreciably from approximately 100,000 at the turn of the twentieth century to thirty-five million today (10% of the overall U.S. population and about 65% of the collective Latino community). We shall therefore pay special attention to what ethnic Mexicans, their offspring, and other Americans have had to say about the Mexican American experience and its effects on Latino/a social life as well as the nation's economy, society, and culture. Naturally, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Central/South American communities in the United States will be examined as well. The study of Latino history is a young discipline, with many gaps and grey areas. It also exists in a complex and tense dialogue (often a monologue) within broader U.S. history.

HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"Prerequisites: reading knowledge of French is highly encouraged. This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

HIST UN3866,WARS OF INDOCHINA,"Saigon and Hanoi served as competing capitals of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) in the south and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in the north (1954-1975). They were symbols of warring states, one home to a fledgling republic, the other the seat of communist power. Since the late 19th century, they have also been sites of Vietnam’s most dramatic transformations. As such, they occupy an important place in the historiography of modern Vietnam, not least in ongoing debates over the Indochina wars, Vietnamese nationalism, and regional difference.     This course examines Saigon and Hanoi as social, political, and cultural spaces, and as representations of their respective states during the war. We first consider the significance of regionalism in fashioning “new ways of being Vietnamese” and examine how colonial rule reinforced those distinctions. We devote the rest of the semester to reading an array of works on the history of these cities. For the colonial period, we examine colonial urbanism, the lives of the poor, intellectuals and their ideas, as well as currents of political agitation and cultural iconoclasm. For the post-World War II period, we will focus on the distinct political cultures that took shape in the RVN and DRV. Finally, we end by looking at Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi in the post-war era, particularly after the Socialist Republic of Vietnam instituted sweeping economic reforms in the 1980s. Each week, we will discuss works social, cultural, and political history of Saigon and Hanoi, all the while keeping in mind their divergent trajectories in the three decades following World War II.",Lien-Hang Nguyen,1:00pm,4:10pm,11296,Morningside,W3866-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/W3866-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212HIST3866W001,SEMINAR

The study of Hungarian, a language of the Finno-Ugric family, offers the opportunity to learn about the phonology of vowel harmony, the syntax of topic-comment discourse, verb agreement with subjects and objects, highly developed case systems and possessive nominal paradigms. In addition to its inflectional profile, Hungarian derivation possibilities are vast, combinatory, and playful. During the semester we will touch upon all the important grammatical aspects of Hungarian and discuss them in relation to general linguistic principles and discourse, and finally, through some text analysis, see them in action. Although the primary discussion will center on Hungarian, we will draw on comparisons to other Finno-Ugric languages, most notably Finnish and Komi; students are encouraged to draw on comparisons with their own languages of interest.

HRTS GU4750,Facing the Violent Past: Prevention and,"How do societies emerging from violence rebuild, and what mechanisms do they employ to punish past perpetrators, to come to terms with difficult pasts, to acknowledge the suffering of victims, and to try to nurture democratic processes that will prevent future violence? This course examines the ways in which societies have addressed the questions of accountability and the challenge of “dealing with the past” in the aftermath of political transition and violent conflict that have marked the last half century. In particular, we will examine the discourse around “historical wrongs,” and attempts—international, national, local—to address such wrongs. The historical context for this exploration is the development, following the defeat of Nazi Germany, of principles, norms and institutions regarding responsibility to memory, universal human rights, and the idea that genocide can and should be prevented. This course will thus begin with an exploration of the Holocaust in memory and history, and an exploration of the post-World War II period as a watershed moment in the development of a discourse around historical justice and the intersection of history, memory and trauma.  The establishment of a new framework for a discourse around history and “dealing with the past” requires an investigation of what it means for a state or a community to take responsibility for its actions, and what repair and prevention look like in post-conflict societies. Much of the course will be devoted to the examination of a series of case studies that coming from the Holocaust, World War II, the fall of communism, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, and the Civil Rights movement in the United States. The question of how societies can address historical wrongs is a question that ultimately requires us to consider the relationship between history, memory, trauma and justice. Why does the past matter? Does the pursuit of justice limit, or compromise, the work that historians are expected to do? What new ways of thinking about history have emerged in the period we are examining (we can think about testimony, museums, sites, literature to name just a few)? In exploring these questions, this course seeks to understand what is necessary for societies to deal with violent pasts, and the success and limitations that the discourse and practice of historical justice suggests when it comes to questions of prevention and repair.",,5:30pm,8:40pm,11274,Morningside,W4750-20212-001,Facing the Violent Past,Summer Session (SUMM),HRTS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/W4750-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212HRTS4750W001,SEMINAR

HUMN PS0101,Human Rights in the 21st Century: Challe,"Are human rights still relevant in promoting social justice and freedom in the 21st Century? Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II. However, recent rises in authoritarianism and anti-liberal regimes have raised new questions on whether the human rights framework is still capable of addressing injustices in the modern world. This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.
 
 In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.
 
 In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.
 
 Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities. The primary assignment for this course is participation in an international moot court activity, which challenges students to research and give oral arguments on a fictitious human rights case.
 
 The course also introduces students to several different perspectives through a variety of guest lecturers.",Alexander de la Paz,1:10pm,3:00pm,10416,Morningside,N0101-20212-004,Human Rights in 21st Cent,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),HUMN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HUMN/N0101-20212-004/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212HUMN0101N004,LECTURE

IDRA PS0201,DRAWING: EYE & IDEA,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  In this beginner-level class, students explore various modes of looking at and interpreting the world through drawing. The course emphasizes drawing from both observation and imagination as ways to learn traditional drawing techniques and foster creativity and personal interpretation. Course assignments stress observation while focusing on experiments with materials so as to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition, use of charcoal and pencil, graphic drawing techniques, wet media, color theory, and optical illusions.  The course combines studio work, including the study of the human figure using live nude models, with outdoor drawing, individual and group critiques, and visits to major museums and art galleries. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week in the form of a short seminar, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.  Participants also learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications, and the session concludes with a group show to which parents, friends, and other program participants are invited.",Ioana I Manolache,1:10pm,4:00pm,10420,Morningside,N0201-20212-D01,Drawing: Eye & Idea,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),IDRA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IDRA/N0201-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212IDRA0201ND01,LABORATORY

IENT PS0101,Introduction to Entrepreneurship & Innov,"This course is intended for students interested in learning the fundamentals of the innovation and development process that gives rise to ventures in both the commercial and social worlds. Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today’s venture success stories.  Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching “shark tank” style in front of a group of experts.  Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.  Upon successful completion of the course, participants will have created fully realizable business models.

IFLM PS0101,Filmmaking with iPhone & iPad,"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker’s Sundance feature film, 
Tangerine
, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary, 
Searching for Sugar Man
, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.  Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.  In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, sound – so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.  In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students’ responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools/career paths.  On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.  Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",Yu Cheng,1:10pm,4:00pm,10430,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,Filmmaking with iPhone &,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),IFLM,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IFLM/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212IFLM0101ND01,LECTURE

We also investigate core issues facing the global community, such as growth and inequality, development, the role of corporations, sustainability, and environmental change.  The course is designed to introduce core economic concepts through experiential case studies and simulations.

This course is a guide for living in a time of free agency, outsourcing, and cross-functional work. Consulting skills are essential to design, recommend, implement, and sell your ideas and programs. The need for expertise goes far beyond having the best idea. It is knowing how to create an idea using a process that builds collaborative relationships and ensures successful adoption of your expertise.     Drawing on examples from a variety of organizations, this course will focus directly on strategies and tactics for designing services and products for organizations or institutions. The entire course and assignments will focus on working with a client to assess the environment, create a prioritized business case, and conclude with an implementation plan. Topics will include whole systems development, strategies for engagement, diagnosis to discovery, ethics and managing your consulting relationship, change management, and establishing yourself as a trusted advisor.     This is a hands-on course where students are expected to identify an existing consulting assignment (internal or external) that we will work throughout the class to help their client improve its effectiveness and competitiveness. Illustrative examples, case studies, interactive exercises, faculty expertise, and special guest leaders will be used to build your confidence and capability for consulting to clients.",Edward J Hoffman,8:00pm,10:00pm,10996,Morningside,K5301-20212-D01,EFFECTIVE KNWLDGE STRAT &,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IKNS/K5301-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20212IKNS5301KD01,LECTURE

IKNS PS5305,NETWORKED WORK,"For-profit and nonprofit organizations, alike, are embracing networks to share insights and data, act as a voting block, serve customers, foster pluralism, and innovate. For example, realtor COMPASS, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and electric cooperatives are all leveraging networks. The ideas of “open” and “collective” are no longer seen as a rarified university experiment. Now these present a viable means for a growing number of purposes: get to market faster, thwart climate change, clean the oceans, and find cures to intractable diseases.     “Networked Work” presents the structure, impacts, and practical work of networks. There are many different forms of network, varying in size, shape and purpose. Yet there are some common practices and behavior models that trace their origins back to the science of the human brain, evolution and social and behavioral psychology. We will use the Knowledge Network Effectiveness Framework, a logic model flowing backwards from outcomes, to individual and social behavior, to dynamics, to design. Our lenses will also include social network analysis (SNA), complex spreading phenomena, behavioral insights, and cooperation. These lenses we bring to discuss practical cases in each of several network forms:     
  
social networks
  
communities of practice (or knowledge-networks),
  
open source,
  
open data, and
  
open innovation.
 
     Students will envision, diagnose and design networks for “cooperative advantage.” We will do that while considering that networks operate in the context of human bias, social influence, sustainability challenges, and technology advancement.",Katrina Pugh,7:00pm,9:00pm,11001,Morningside,K5305-20212-D01,,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IKNS/K5305-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,R,20212IKNS5305KD01,ONLINE COURS

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10602,Morningside,S6559-20212-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INAF,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6559-20212-001/,614 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212INAF6559S001,SEMINAR

INDI PS0101,Introduction to Digital Filmmaking,"In this beginner-level course, participants use their personal cameras (either iPhones, iPads, or DSLR’s) to create strong, visually-driven short films and video exercises with an emphasis on the foundations of narrative storytelling. They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.
 
 Students begin by learning the elements of digital filmmaking with video exercises that start off simply at first, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment until they advance to a final film project.
 
 For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts.
 
 Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other’s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.
 
 The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",Yu Cheng,3:10pm,5:00pm,10436,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,Intro to Digital Filmmaki,Summer High School Program,INDI,http://culpa.info/professors/13211,,1.0,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INDI/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,High School Program,0,,MTWRF,20212INDI0101ND01,LECTURE

The combination of subjects and methods enables participants to experience math in a way high schools are often unable to present it, approaching problems as open-ended opportunities for creativity, independent thinking, and intellectual excitement.  The course is divided into three units:  
  
Logic: An exploration of logic builds the groundwork for further mathematical reasoning. What is mathematical logic? How does one structure a proof? How can this framework be applied to philosophical thought? One topic covered is game theory (how mathematicians study decision-making), which has applications in fields such as economics, biology, and psychology.
  
Counting and Probability: Abstract counting, in the form of combinatorics, serves as an introduction to set theory, which in turn sets the stage for probability theory. As an application, the class delves into cryptography, looking at how math can be used to create and read secret messages.
  
Advanced Topics: In the final week, building on what we have done already and depending one students’ interests, we look at a few advanced topics. Potential topics include planetary orbits, symmetry, topology, common statistical fallacies, and Markov chains.

ITAD PS0400,Introduction to Trial Advocacy,"Through lectures, assigned readings, class discussions, and group projects, students acquire an overview of the United States legal system and the federal and state court systems, ultimately gaining an understanding of the fundamentals of modern trial advocacy.  Distinctions are made between criminal law and civil law with a focus on the different burdens of proof in the two areas. Special attention is paid to the three key components of trial law: the attorney as advocate, the judge as the gatekeeper of the evidence, and the role of the jury as the ultimate fact finder.  Students prepare a case, complete with witnesses and exhibits, through final trial before a jury. Through daily classroom exercises, they learn how to present and cross-examine witnesses, introduce exhibits into evidence, and develop trial strategy to effectively argue their positions to a jury.  The course culminates with participants, divided into teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys, presenting their final cased in the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Manhattan through trial before a jury.",,1:10pm,3:00pm,10448,Morningside,N0400-20212-D01,Introduction to Trial Adv,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ITAD,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ITAD/N0400-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ITAD0400ND01,LECTURE

JOUR J3101,Political Reporting: On the Campaign Tra,"Political journalism--from the campaign trail to the halls of Congress--has played a vital and important role over the last four years. This course will offer an overview and critical examination of political journalism and the interaction of media with the White House, Congress, campaigns and statehouses. It will explore how technology and polarization have changed coverage of politics, as well as ethical considerations, shifting newsroom expectations and the challenges facing journalists as they cover campaigns and American political institutions.  The course is intended for students with a deep interest politics and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners. It aims to both provide practical training and promote critical thinking about political journalism itself. The focus will be largely on print journalism, though radio and television work will be briefly explored along with opinion writing. This will be a writing intensive class with a focus on practical skills. Workshopping of written articles will be required and there will be in-class writing and reporting exercises. Students will both examine their own biases and meet with leading practioners of the craft.   The course is led by

JOUR J3102,Journalism in an Age of Activism,"Social and political change can be powered by protest and coordinated acts of civil dissent. In modern American life, it is easier than ever to share information and rally supporters to a cause, but the propulsive force of protest movements happens in the streets. In an age when lies and conspiracy theories can outpace the truth and protesters, counter protesters, and law enforcement all view the press with skepticism, how can journalists verify, interrogate, and report on what is happening while also remaining safe and keeping their sources safe? What does it mean to report on a protest objectively? And should that even be a goal?   This course offers an overview and critical examination of journalistic coverage of protest and civil dissent over the last sixty years. It explores specific selections of protest reporting in a range of media formats, including photography and video journalism, audio news, investigative longform, and personal essays, as well as considers the ethical considerations, risks, and challenges that journalists navigate as they cover individual protests and protest movements writ large.    Over the course of the semester, students will learn the fundamentals of modern journalistic practice as well as analyze the origins and purposes of protest reporting. We will examine the challenges the practice of civil dissent journalism faces in the present day and discuss how journalism shapes public discourse around activism, protests, and other forms of political dissent.  The course is intended for students with a deep interest in activism, civil dissent, political unrest, and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners of the craft. It aims to promote skepticism of official narratives and improve critical thinking about how protest movements are covered by journalists.",Christopher Sanders,9:00am,12:10pm,10585,Morningside,S3102-20212-001,Journ in an Age of Activi,Summer Session (SUMM),JOUR,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/JOUR/S3102-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,"Barnard College

JOUR PS0101,Creative Journalism,"What creative possibilities do true stories hold? How can truth telling and storytelling work together? This class helps students build interviewing and reporting skills while learning about journalistic ethics and exploring forms such as feature writing, profiles, op-eds, and audio pieces.

JWST S4145,Topics in Israeli Cinema,"Israel has a unique and constantly-evolving national cinema, the product of its diverse immigrant population, influences from neighboring nations, and dramatic national history. Beginning with artistic influences from abroad and culminating with native self-examinations, this course will provide a survey of Israeli film history, recurring foci of Israeli cinema, and introductions to influential filmmakers from early director and impresario Menahem Golan to Orthodox writer/director Rama Burshtein.  Each class meeting will include a complete screening of an Israeli feature film, as well as clips of related works. Readings will include critical essays and histories which elaborate on in-class screenings and cover additional topics and films. Written assignments will be three analytical essays which will encourage critical thinking, close analysis of films, and independent research beyond the materials presented in class.  All readings are in English. All feature films and film clips are in Hebrew (some include Arabic), and will be presented with English subtitles. Students fluent in Hebrew and Arabic are encouraged to interpret the dialogue for additional meaning that may not be translated in the subtitles.",Stuart Weinstock,6:15pm,9:25pm,11295,Morningside,W4145-20212-002,,Summer Session (SUMM),JWST,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/JWST/W4145-20212-002/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212JWST4145W002,FILM SCREENI
JWST UN4849,Israeli National Security Strategy,"Recent decades have been witness to a widening circle of regional actors at peace with Israel, starting with Egypt and Jordan and more recently the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. New and previously unimagined opportunities for regional cooperation now exist. Due to the great importance of the Middle East, from the Cold War to the present, as well as its own unique circumstances, Israel has also become an important player in the international arena, far beyond its size. This one credit summer course is open to all undergraduate students and is designed to provide an overview of some of the primary national security issues facing Israel today. Classes will be held twice a week for three weeks. Each 2.5 hour class will address one major subject area. The course will include 2-3 guest speakers and 1-2 structured policy debates or simulation games. In order to gain a deeper appreciation of the real world challenges facing Israeli decision-makers, students will draft policy papers on two of the primary subjects discussed.",Charles D Freilich,12:00pm,1:50pm,14350,Morningside,C4849-20212-001,Israeli Nat'l Security St,Summer Session (SUMM),JWST,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/JWST/C4849-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,1,,TWR,20212JWST4849C001,SEMINAR
KNOW PS0101,"Knowledge, Reality, and Truth","Is it possible that how things “really” or “truly” are is very different from how they appear to us? Could it be, for example, that the “real world” in which we believe ourselves to live is actually a computer program, á la 
The Matrix
? If not, then how can we know that this is not the case – what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge – what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference – would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways – if we actually are living in the Matrix?  In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato’s 
Republic
 and René Descartes’ 
Meditations
, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.  This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students’ abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.  Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",Alexander C Rigas,3:10pm,5:00pm,10456,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,"Knowledge, Reality, and T",Pre-College Programs (SHSP),KNOW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/KNOW/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212KNOW0101ND01,LECTURE

LANI PS0213,Language & Identity: A Linguistic Explor,"In this course students examine language as a vital part of culture and social structure while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We first tackle assumptions and myths we hold about language. For example, can animals learn to use language? Do Eskimo languages really have 17 separate words for snow? Is English the hardest language to learn? Then we explore the components of language (phonemes, morphemes, words, and sentences) and how each plays a role in what we hear as an “accent” or dialect. Thus, students investigate both the structural and cultural functions of human language.  The course employs a multi-disciplinary approach to investigating language behavior and variation in different cultures. This occurs mainly through the term project, which provides each student with the opportunity to conduct fieldwork as a means to research a culture and its use of language. Participants come to better understand themselves as members of their own cultures and language as a shaper of our self-identities in human society.  In the morning sessions we examine material in a seminar format. Afternoons are devoted to research, analysis of case studies, and other hands-on applications including probing popular culture, literature, and film for evidence of language used as a way to define cultural and social identities.  Students develop the skills of data collection and cross-linguistic and cross-cultural analysis and come away with a perspective of multiple viewpoints related to language correctness and relativity.",Jason Meilands,3:10pm,5:00pm,10457,Morningside,N0213-20212-D01,LANGUAGE AND IDENTITY,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LANI,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LANI/N0213-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212LANI0213ND01,LECTURE

LASJ PS0101,Law as a Tool for Social Justice,"Knowledge of law and legal process can be used as a tool to address issues of social justice. Whether a lawyer or a layperson, there is opportunity for individuals to engage in advocacy, whether on behalf of a single battered woman or in support of displaced refugees. In this course, which focuses primarily on the legal system in the United States, we:  
  
Survey the fundamentals of substantive law, such as criminal law, constitutional law, property law, contract law, and torts.
  
Explore legal procedure as a means to enhance – or frustrate – justice.
  
Look closely at successful litigation and political movements as means of bringing about social change.
  
Meet legal practitioners in a variety of advocacy areas who share how they use the law to achieve the ends of justice.
  
Visit pertinent sites such as the New York County Criminal Court and District Attorney’s Office (inspiration for 
Law and Order
) and the United Nations Headquarters.
 
  Case studies come from areas such as civil rights, environmental protection, criminal justice, immigration policy, international human rights, family law, and animal rights.  Participants should be willing to dedicate several hours per week on case law readings, drafting of briefs, and related mock trial/moot court preparation.  At the conclusion of the course, students, working in groups, produce a strategic advocacy project for addressing an issue of interest to them from among the subjects addressed in the course.",James O'Brien,1:10pm,3:00pm,10459,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,Law as Tool for Social Ju,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LASJ,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LASJ/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212LASJ0101ND01,LECTURE

LAW_ PS0101,Introduction to Criminal Law,"This course is designed to give students an opportunity to explore substantive criminal law and its attendant legal issues. Beginning with an introduction to the courts, legal system, and Constitution of the United States, the course provides students with a foundation for a detailed examination of the structure, policies, interpretation, and application of criminal law.  We delve into a variety of topics, from the basic elements of crimes such as homicide, robbery, and assault, to inchoate crimes like attempt and conspiracy, to crimes against property. Students evaluate the fairness and morality of punishments, including the death penalty, and analyze and apply legal defenses.  We delve into a variety of topics, from the basic elements of crimes such as homicide, robbery, and assault, to inchoate crimes like attempt and conspiracy, to crimes against property. Students evaluate the fairness and morality of punishments, including the death penalty, and analyze and apply legal defenses.  Participants also learn to recognize the primary sources of criminal law in the US, and probe the boundaries of statutory law as imposed by state and federal constitutions. Students write legal briefs of landmark court cases and prepare and deliver courtroom-style legal arguments in a mock trial exercise. All of these issues are explored against the broader backdrop of race and socio-economic class in America.  The course provides an opportunity for students to gain academic skills for high school and beyond. Sophisticated legal readings sharpen their text analysis, critical thinking, and reading comprehension abilities. Participants burnish their oral communication, argument, and debate skills through case law discussions and mock trial activities.",Jason Goldsmith,1:10pm,3:00pm,10460,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Introduction to Criminal,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LAW_,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LAW_/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212LAW_0101KD01,LECTURE
LELA PS0212,Exploring Careers in Law,"In this experiential course designed for students considering careers in law, participants acquire a realistic understanding of the legal profession and of the steps and skills necessary for success within it. In the process, they gain insight into whether a career in law would be fulfilling to them.  At the heart of the course is exposure to the real world of legal practice. Through presentations by attorneys representing a broad range of practice areas and through visits to law firms, courts (including Manhattan’s Criminal Court, inspiration for television’s 
Law and Order
), and public interest legal organizations, participants learn first-hand about law as it is practiced in the corporate, government, and non-profit sectors.  The course teacher provides substantive instruction related to first-year law school courses as well as LSAT test prep information and gives students a clear view of the requirements for law school and attorney licensing in the United States.  Participants gain public speaking experience through debate, mock trial, and moot court exercises and engage in fundamental legal research and writing assignments, thereby developing skills which are transferable across academic disciplines.  Students engage in a number of exercises requiring application of the principles and concepts learned throughout the program. A culminating collaborative practicum project is a special opportunity for them to employ their knowledge so as to develop and present a law-based solution to a specific social issue of interest to them.",James O'Brien,1:10pm,3:00pm,10461,Morningside,N0212-20212-D01,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LELA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LELA/N0212-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212LELA0212ND01,LECTURE

LING PS0100,Exploring Topics in Linguistics,"This course examines five intriguing areas of linguistics that relate to crucial 21st Century social issues. Starting with fossils and skulls, we explore where language came from, how it evolved, and how it differs from animal communication. Next, we look at language variation (in the form of accents, dialect, and slang) and imposed linguistic policies (such as spelling) that manipulate our native abilities to communicate. We move onto pragmatics, the study of how language use varies based on context, audience, formality, speaker intentionality, and even gender identity. Next, we explore language taboos (curse words, censorship) and language prestige (the social value placed on different speaking styles). We finish with an analysis of the Internet's impact on language (memes, texting, the possible decline of ""proper"" English, and the limitations of AI communication).
 
 Students work in the morning with texts, lectures, and films, covering the principles of linguistics and the relevant literature. In the afternoon, they problem-solve by working through case studies and analyzing linguistic evidence via databases and other web resources. Guest speakers who are active in their fields add a level of detail and specificity to the course.
 
 Participants gain a deeper understanding of the role of language in their society and linguistics as an interdisciplinary tool for greater insight into how we live.",Kathryn O'Shields,1:10pm,3:00pm,10462,Morningside,K0100-20212-D02,Topics in Linguistics,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),LING,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LING/K0100-20212-D02/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212LING0100KD02,LECTURE
LING UN3102,Endangered Languages in the Global City:,"Of the world’s estimated 7,000 languages – representing migrations and historical developments thousands of years old – the majority are oral, little-documented, and increasingly endangered under the onslaught of global languages like English. This course will take the unprecedented, paradoxical linguistic capital of New York City as a lens for examining how immigrants form communities in a new land, how those communities are integrated into the wider society, and how they grapple with linguistic and cultural loss. Interdisciplinary with an experiential learning component, the course will focus on texts, materials, encounters, and fieldwork with three of the city’s newest and least-studied indigenous immigrant communities (indigenous Latin Americans, Himalayans, and Central Asians).Indigeneity, though often invisible or perceived as marginal in global cities like New York, is in fact pervasive and fundamental. Cities now constitute a crucial site for understanding migration and cultural change, with language a vehicle for culture. Studying cultures only in situ (i.e. in their homelands) risks missing a crucial dimension. Students will be immersed in stateless, oral, immigrant cultures while also gaining a hands-on critical understanding of language endangerment and urban sociolinguistic research, first through field experiences and guest speakers (Endangered Language Alliance partners) and then by going out together into communities to work on projects in small teams. The Endangered Language Alliance (ELA), where the instructor is Co-Director, was formed as a non-profit research institute in 2010 as a forum for researchers, community members, activists, artists, and other New Yorkers to come together to support indigenous and minority languages. ELA’s video recordings provide first-hand testimony of endangered languages in the global city – in indigenous languages with English translation – available in few other places. Those texts will be central to this course, supplemented by the new,first-ever, detailed language map of New York City being produced by ELA.",Ross Perlin,9:00am,12:10pm,10273,Morningside,W3102-20212-001,ENDANGERED LANGUAGES,Summer Session (SUMM),LING,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perlin,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LING/W3102-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212LING3102W001,LECTURE

Once they have a foundation in legal research, reasoning, and writing, they are given an in-depth look at various types of law through interactive sessions with practicing lawyers, via guest speakers and field trips to law firms. They learn how to problem solve using the lawyer’s toolbox and how to analyze legal sources and develop legal arguments based on and supported by the law and cases we research.

By engaging with challenging practical problems, students hone their independent thinking and problem-solving skills.  Areas covered include the following:  
  
Graph theory, a topic heavily developed by both mathematicians and computer scientists. We explore algorithmic ways to compute, for example, the optimal path between two points on a map (minimizing cost, time, or another parameter). Another application is minimizing the cost of an electrical network which has to provide power to all residents in a new neighborhood.
  
Probability and its numerous applications. We look at how probabilities are applied in economics and in popular media, and examine how they can sometimes be counter-intuitive or even deceptive.
  
Various counting methods, combinatorics, and examples of Nash equilibria. We study applications of these techniques in economics (the prisoner's dilemma), computer science (assessing the complexity of an algorithm), finance (loans and investments), and biology (population growth).

MDES GU4219,SPOKEN ARABIC II,"Prerequisites: MDES UN2202 This is an introductory course to Levantine Arabic for students who have completed two years of Standard Arabic studies, at the Intermediate level. The course is designed to further develop fluency in oral communication, through building students’ familiarity with a less formal register of Arabic, namely the Levantine dialect. The course will convert and recycle some of the previous Standard Arabic knowledge to the dialect, by comparing their prior knowledge to its dialectal counterpart; while at the same time developing students’ new communicative skills in a diverse range of contexts that are essential in any conversational interaction. The course will build students abilities to interact effectively in various areas where Levantine Arabic is spoken. In addition to varied thematic topics, the course exposes students to cultural aspects specific to the region. Additionally, the course will work on both constructing students’ knowledge of dialectal diction as well as other grammatical features of the dialects.

zajal—
colloquial poetry), and memoirs and diaries by the women and men who withstood the ravages of war and helped shape the modern Middle East.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:00pm,12637,Morningside,W1001-20212-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Dabashi,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/W1001-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,TR,20212MDES1001W001,LECTURE

MDES UN2399,ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LITERATURE,"This colloquium is a course on many influential texts of literature from Ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Sumerian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Canaanite, and others. The emphasis is on investigating the literary traditions of each culture – the subject matter, form, methods, and symbolism– that distinguish them from one another and from later traditions of the Middle East. The course is not
 a “civilization” course, nor is it a history class, although elements of culture and history will be mentioned as necessary. The course is intended to provide a facility with, and an awareness of, the content and context of ancient works of literature in translation from the Ancient Middle East.  
 Students in this course will gain a familiarity with the major cultures of the Ancient Middle East, the best known and most remarked upon stories, and the legacy of those works on some later traditions. The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.  
 All assigned readings for the course will be in English. The course meets once a week and sessions are two hours long.",Nathanael P Shelley,12:10pm,2:00pm,00188,Barnard College,W2399-20212-001,ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LIT,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,MDES,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/W2399-20212-001/,To be announced,,,4,,MW,20212MDES2399W001,COLLOQUIA

MDES UN3331,URBAN SPACE & CONFLICT IN MIDDLE EAST,"This course explores how civil war, revolution, militarization, mass violence, refugee crises, and terrorism impact urban spaces, and how city dwellers engage in urban resilience, negotiate and attempt to reclaim their right to the city. Through case studies of Beirut (1975-present), Baghdad (2003-present), Cairo (2011-present), Diyarbakir (1914-present), Aleppo (1914-present), and Jerusalem (1914-present), this course traces how urban life adjusted to destruction (and post-conflict reconstruction), violence, and anarchy; how neighborhoods were reshaped; and how local ethnic, religious, and political dynamics played out in these cities and metropolises. Relying on multi-disciplinary and post-disciplinary scholarship, and employing a wealth of audiovisual material, literary works, and interviews conducted by the instructor, the course scrutinizes how conflicts have impacted urban life in the Middle East, and how civilians react to, confront, and resist militarization in urban spaces.",Khatchig Mouradian,5:30pm,8:30pm,12638,Morningside,W3331-20212-001,URBAN SPACE & CONFLICT IN,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatchig_Mouradian,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/W3331-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212MDES3331W001,LECTURE

MEPO PS0104,The Media and Politics in the United Sta,"This course explores a broad range of questions concerning the relationship between the media and politics, with a focus on historical and contemporary issues presented in the American context: Do the news media educate or manipulate the citizenry? What is the role of the press in a democracy and how does the First Amendment protect the press in the United States? What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing “weaponization” of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America’s system of democratic government.  Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10466,Morningside,N0104-20212-D01,The Media and Politics in,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MEPO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MEPO/N0104-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212MEPO0104ND01,LECTURE
MGLO PS0101,The Media and Politics in Global Perspec,"The combination of globalization and new communication technologies has had a dramatic impact on the relationship between media and politics. In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.  We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.  Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, field trips, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10467,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,The Media and Politics,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MGLO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MGLO/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212MGLO0101ND01,LECTURE
MIGR PS0101,Global Migration & Personal Identity,"Migration has never been so disruptive a phenomenon and omnipresent a political topic as it is today, both globally and in the United States. We are living in a period that is witness to catastrophic refugee crises, with large populations of displaced peoples fleeing war, economic crisis, and political or social persecution across the globe. At the same time, migration is a topic that directly relates to modern concepts of identity. Who are we? What defines us? How does one’s identity change and evolve? Those who migrate to new host countries are directly confronted with these challenging questions. Individual and national identities are formed and evolve based on how these questions are addressed.  This course is an introductory seminar that links the individual human experience of migration to current political and cultural systems. Why do people migrate? How do they migrate? Can they migrate? How are they perceived in the host country? How do migrants view and define themselves? How are concepts of identity affected by the process of migration?  Participants examine migration as a dynamic part of culture and society while discovering how it reflects and shapes our lives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach to look into the concepts of identity and its transformation and to understand migration and how it shapes identity across cultures and contexts. We then utilize this conceptual basis to challenge assumptions and myths we hold about the Other and perceptions we have about Self. Regarding the Other, we also look at how current trends are catalyzing shifts in national and international migration policies—and are sparking growing opposition to immigration in numerous host countries.  We approach the material through various formats including discussion, readings, field trips, research projects, and guest speakers. Class activities involve active application of methods, including researching popular culture information sources, literature, video, and film for indications of how migration defines/redefines cultural and social identities. Guest speakers offer various views of migration and identity across disciplines. We also visit the Tenement Museum, where we explore the story of immigration in New York City.  Outside of class, students read articles on migration theory as well as various case studies, including life stories of young migrants in Europe, accounts of the border crisis in the US, and testimonies from DACA recipients.

MOCH PS0208,Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry,"Chemistry, the central science, is the science of molecules and bonds. Its signature is change in all its manifestations, from events that happen on a geological time scale to those that happen instantaneously, from the cosmological to the subatomic scale. Chemistry provides powerful scientific tools that extend our ability to sense the magnitudes of change by stretching the limits of what we know of our universe.  Intensive Seminars in Modern Chemistry is designed for highly motivated students who want to strengthen their understanding of chemistry and current research methods. The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a presentation by senior faculty members and researchers that is expanded upon through small group discussions and laboratory experiences.  Topics have been selected because they stand out as essential themes of current research, illustrate the methods of science, lend themselves to historical development, and highlight the role of chemistry as the central science. Through integrative experiments and collaborative projects, students discover the synthetic and analytic dimensions of chemistry in forensic, environmental, and materials problems. Experiments emphasize the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills.  Formal training includes instrumental methods in spectroscopy, chromatography, magnetic resonance, and computer simulations with state-of-the-art equipment in the department’s modern laboratories. Guest lecturers and field trips to area research facilities round out the program. Students are expected to complete a small research project, prepare a scientific paper, and participate regularly in class discussions.",Luis A Avila,1:10pm,3:00pm,10469,Morningside,N0208-20212-D01,Modern Chemistry,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),MOCH,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MOCH/N0208-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212MOCH0208ND01,SEMINAR

NANO PS0226,Introduction to Material Science & Nanot,"The progress of civilization is inscribed in the history of humans and their materials—the Stone Age, the Iron Age, and today’s Age of Plastics. Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches (and recovers), nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications. Engineers are mostly successful at designing and manufacturing objects and devices, but on occasion there are catastrophic failures—bridges collapse, airplanes fall from the sky, containers leak, pipes burst, and the electrical grid goes down, leaving us cold and in the dark. And there are the annoying little failures—light bulbs burn out, clothes become permanently stained, foods spoil, and batteries die.  In this challenging course, participants experience a hands-on introduction to materials science, engineering, and technology, from the bulk properties of the solid state to the nanoscale properties of large and small molecules and single atoms. Special attention is given to nanoscale materials and devices because of their potential for defining the next generation of important materials and machines. It has been said that the nanoscale is the new frontier of science and technology.  Students investigate these worlds in a discovery-based environment, working under the guidance of an experienced instructor and a team of assistants, research scientists, and technologists from Columbia’s Department of Chemistry and from industry and national laboratories. The studio classroom format integrates laboratory and lecture and encourages teaching and learning especially useful to those considering undergraduate studies in engineering and science.",Luis A Avila,1:10pm,3:00pm,10470,Morningside,N0226-20212-D01,Material Science & Nanote,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),NANO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/NANO/N0226-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212NANO0226ND01,LECTURE
NATU PS0101,"Natural Resources, Global Markets,  and","How has the US–China trade war affected the growth of world economies? Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?  This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.  Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers – i.e. export (supply/origin) and import (demand/destination) hubs – along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.  Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources – including those that are sustainable – and their effect in the global landscape.  Students gain an understanding of – and think critically about – various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials.

NBIO PS0101,The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"Learning and memory are the processes by which we store information about our experiences, which is crucial for our survival. Without learning and memory, we would be unable to acquire basic motor or communication skills, the ability to perform complex reasoning, or social dynamics. Modern neuroscience has made great strides toward understanding how our experiences shape our brains, and how changes in our brains impact behavior.  In this course we explore how our experiences shape who we are, what kinds of changes in the brain are thought to underlie learning and memory, and how learning and memory can contribute to the development of mental health problems such as addiction, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Topics to be covered include types of learning and memory, disorders such as amnesias and dementias, an introduction to the cellular and molecular basis of memory formation, and an in-depth examination about how these processes can contribute to mental health problems. We conclude the course with an overview of innovative treatments under development for various disorders, and how learning and memory might play a role in their therapeutic effects.

NECR PS5202,ADVANCED CONFLICT RESOLUTION,"A multitude of approaches guide the practitioner when faced with a problem. In conflict resolution, these approaches stem from a range of disciplines, whether from psychology, social psychology, political science, international relations, clinical psychology or even from quantum theory and the latest advances in neuroscience. From this palette of theories, frameworks, and models, the avid and adequately equipped practitioner is able to engage with the conflicts arising from various situations. Ideally, he/she is able to prevent, reduce, mitigate or to de-escalate the conflict to such a degree that actors are able to constructively engage in handling their issues. The competence to understand the drivers and triggers of conflict, and the motives that actors have to engage in conflict is derived from the practitioner’s capacity and capability to be flexible, adaptable, and critical in deploying the knowledge and tools appropriate to resolve any conflict, whether international, communal, organizational or interpersonal.  Using a combination of analysis and case studies, this course explores the intersection of theory and analysis, covering the various concepts and frameworks available in the field and applying them to current situations. The critical engagement with the discipline allows students to improve their critical thinking skills, asking a range of questions to appraise the validity of each introduced concept and model, thereby reflecting proactively on whether or not a theory is useful and applicable in explaining the myriad phenomena emerging from a conflict. Knowing when a theory is advantageous to allow for the investigation into what drives, triggers, and motivates the behaviors, attitudes, or emotions of conflict parties immerses students into the reality and practicality of dealing with complex issues and the pitfalls of making recommendations short of viable entry points for leveraging peace and bringing a potentially protracted conflict to a different pathway. The acquired competences are applicable not only towards the program, but also beyond the program as students will be empowered to reflect critically on a text, understand the internal and external validity of a theory, circumvent logical errors, focus on concise and cohesive line of argumentation, and apply results-based recommendations. These skills and competences are applicable to any position requiring analytical, writing, and presentation skills.  This course builds on and expands the learnings from PS5101.

NSCI PS0100,Neuroscience and the Law,"In this course we look at how the brain functions, what the legal issues are, how the technologies that attempt to understand and address brain functioning work, and why this is pertinent to the legal system. Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.  The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.  Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?  Some of the topics that may be addressed include the 
Frye and Daubert
 standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.

NYCS PS0215,New York Experienced: An Urban Case Stud,"An experiential, immersive course designed for students interested in the urban environment, culture, literature, history, and public policy. The course comprises four interconnected modules (see below). Two days each week are reserved for fieldwork in New York City with city policymakers, philanthropists, and artists.
 
 
New York City: A History of People, Politics, and Place
 What is New York City’s relationship to the American Dream? How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the other aspects in the course. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.
 
 
Writing the City
 How is our experience of New York – the city’s projected image and self-image – shaped by literature about the city? Using short stories, poems, popular song, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon. Beyond this examination, writing in the field enables students to reflect upon their experiences in the city and acts to tie the various threads of the course together while remaining true to the singular experience of each course participant.
 
 
Urban Place Design
 What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city? We study various answers to this question – public/private partnerships (e.g. Bryant Park), the NYC Department of Transportation Plaza Program, public parks (e.g. Central Park), privately-owned public spaces, and business improvement districts – in order to learn the fundamental dynamics of public space in New York City. Armed with that knowledge, we select a location and design our own proposals for public spaces. We also examine how previous urban designers, such as Robert Moses, sought to overcome the challenges faced in constructing (and reconstructing) the city – and how those solutions often have ramifications for today’s NYC. Fieldwork: visiting and evaluating public plazas, meeting with designers and policymakers at the NY Department of Transportation, Neighborhood Plaza Partnership, and Times Square Alliance.

OHMA GR5089,Listening After the Interview: Oral Hist,"Oral history practitioners understand the critical importance of attentive and active listening during the interview. Even after the recording has ended, listening to the interview is equally vital: in transcribing, archiving, interpreting, curating, and presenting. Thus, this course takes listening to be central to modes of inquiry and amplification, and the oral history interview as both an object to be queried and subject that queries. We will reflect upon how oral histories serve as both primary and secondary sources, and challenge historical inquiry even while uniquely enabling new insights into the past. To do so, the distinguishing features of oral histories--as document, text, medium, dialogue, and publication--will serve as the thematic framework for our reading of key practitioner theorists alongside applied listening to sample oral histories. Drawing on the instructor’s experiences in directing oral history-based public history initiatives, throughout the course we will consider the public life of oral histories beyond the interview--as archive, publication, podcast, and exhibition. In so doing, we will look to understand the role of oral historians as both documentarians and co-creators with their narrators of historical knowledge about the past and present.",Zaheer Ali,4:00pm,5:50pm,13372,Morningside,S5089-20212-001,Listening After the Inter,Summer Session (SUMM),OHMA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/OHMA/S5089-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,2,,W,20212OHMA5089S001,SEMINAR
OHMA GR5090,Serious Play: Oral History and the Art o,"In this workshop, OHMA students will deepen their exploration of core tensions in the practice of oral history through the creation of narrative art in a range of genres and forms, including writing and performance. We ask of each form: What lines are marked by conventions of genre, and how do those compare to lines drawn by the ethics of oral history? How can we draw on narrative and performance in our own creative and scholarly contributions to oral history?     This class will be a space for experimentation and serious play, where students will discuss questions raised by the work of others, and grapple with those questions by making their own creative work. Pedagogically, we will simultaneously explore two areas of creation: oral history on the page, and oral history in performance. Students will make new work and engage in discussion about existing work. Class time will be spent discussing texts, workshopping students’ creative projects, and participating in activities designed to prompt collaboration and engineered to inspire new work. Over the course of the semester students will write, perform, and create prompts inspired by oral history.",,10:00am,1:20pm,12212,Morningside,G5090-20212-001,OH and the Art of Story,Summer Session (SUMM),OHMA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/OHMA/G5090-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,4,,MR,20212OHMA5090G001,SEMINAR

PARS OC3817,BLACK PARIS,"Prerequisites:
 5 semesters of college-level French or the equivalent. This course is taught in French.  
Eligibility: 
This course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students  This undergraduate course aims to unveil a lesser known face of Paris linked to its colonial past in order to reread the present social, political and cultural landscape of France's capital city. By visiting hotspots of a forgotten Parisian black history, students will learn about the legacy of a colonial past often unknown and neglected. Sites will include the Latin Quarter which saw the birth of Negritude movement in the 1930s with the encounter of African and Caribbean intellectuals (Cesaire, Senghor, Damas) and the foundation of the editions Presence Africaine with Alioune Diop; Saint Germain des Pres and Pigalle which celebrated jazz music in cabarets; the Museum of the history of immigration in Porte Doree and the Musee des Arts Premiers at the Quai Branly. This itinerant historical approach of Paris will be complemented by an exploration of the contemporary cultural and artistic politics of the Black stage. by Attending theater plays, dance shows, and concerts, and meeting African and Caribbean artists living in Paris (playwrights, directors, actors, choreographers, dancers, musicians), students will enjoy the opportunity to explore Black Parisian culture from an insider's point of view and find out what it means to be a Black artist today in France.  To enroll in this course, you must apply to the 
Columbia Summer in Paris Program
 through the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE).

PENQ PS0201,"Intro to Philosophical Enquiry: Love, Hu","This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.  We begin by reading and discussing Plato's 
Symposium
 and Aristotle's 
Nicomachean Ethics
, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom—a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia?    Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of existential freedom found in 
Being and Nothingness
 and Soren Kierkegaard’s religious freedom from 
Fear and Trembling
, which Donald Palmer introduces in 
Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy
. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work 
The Myth of Sisyphus
. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.  In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",Alec U Milton,3:10pm,5:00pm,10490,Morningside,N0201-20212-D01,Intro to Philosophical En,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PENQ,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PENQ/N0201-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212PENQ0201ND01,LECTURE

PHMN PS0100,"Minds, Brains, and the Nature of Conscio","How is the mind related to the brain? Are sensations, beliefs, and desires immaterial or physical states? What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?
 
 We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.
 
 Course readings include such influential works as René Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's ""Sensations and Brain Processes,” Hilary Putnam’s “The Nature of Mental States,” and Thomas Nagel’s “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.
 
 The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students’ analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",Jared Peterson,3:10pm,5:00pm,10491,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,Intro to Philosophy of Mi,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHMN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHMN/K0100-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212PHMN0100KD01,LECTURE
PHOT PS0202,The Art of Cell Phone Photography,"Studio arts courses are offered in conjunction with Columbia University's School of the Arts.
  This class is an introduction to the tools and techniques of digital photography and the language of photo criticism. Using their own cell phone cameras students work to understand the functions and potentials of the cameras we carry with us every day while exploring the medium's context within contemporary photography.  Each day students undertake assignments designed to explore the distinct qualities of taking photos with a cell phone while engaging with the language and context of the photographic medium. We focus on storytelling, with assignments considering traditional formats of portraiture, still life, and landscape, as well as editing and sequencing. The class culminates in a project combining moving and still images.  We also look at digital platforms for sharing and publishing work and undertake projects which both finesse the cellphone camera’s abilities and embrace its glitches and limitations. This intensive program enables photographers to take full advantage of a tool already at their side and to fine-tune it into an art practice.",Rachel L Stern,1:10pm,4:00pm,10492,Morningside,K0202-20212-D01,Art of Cell Phone Photogr,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHOT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHOT/K0202-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212PHOT0202KD01,STUDIO
PHPO PS0101,Understanding Modern Ideologies,"At the end of the Cold War, many in the West celebrated what they perceived as not only a political victory over the Soviet Union but also the intellectual and ideological ascendency of liberal democracy. And yet three decades later many liberal democracies are facing numerous challenges, if not outright crises.  This course explores the key political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world that seek to challenge, improve, and even threaten liberal democracy. We begin by asking what an ideology is, before delving into the various -isms including liberalism itself, capitalism, socialism, communism, populism, and nationalism. We investigate how these ideologies shape societies and mold social behavior, exploring their origins and principles. We ask how these ideologies intersect with democratic governance and offer different understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship. Our goal is not to determine which ideology is best but rather to understand and critique the many different ways of thinking about politics and society. We draft initial ideology statements, to be revised during the course as students reflect on and question their own assumptions and beliefs through engagement with different perspectives. Participants also engage in debates with their peers in order to practice articulating arguments in a persuasive manner.  Morning sessions are normally dedicated to reviewing and clarifying the assigned material, which includes classic and contemporary works in political theory as well as news and magazine articles and film clips. In the afternoon, students apply their understanding in group activities including debates, and engage with guest speakers from various ideological positions.  By the end of the course, participants not only better understand the key ideologies of the modern world but are also equipped with the analytical tools to critique and revise them in a forward-thinking way.",Ki Young Kim,3:10pm,5:00pm,10493,Morningside,K0101-20212-D01,Understanding Modern Ideo,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PHPO,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHPO/K0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212PHPO0101KD01,LECTURE

 In this course students gain a hands-on understanding of the basic principles of digital photography, approaching it within the context of the fine arts.
 
 Using their own DSLR cameras, participants work on assignments and self-directed projects which touch on a diverse range of approaches to photography, with the goal of creating a final portfolio for web presentation at the course's conclusion. The course takes the form of both a seminar and a lab, and participants work on both individual and collaborative projects.
 
 We focus on the critical context of photography and its broad conceptual applications. Critical issues in art are addressed in the form of short seminars designed to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.
 
 Upon conclusion of the course, students will have completed a web-based portfolio to showcase their new bodies of work.
 
 Participants are expected to have their own DSLR cameras and access to Adobe Photoshop and Bridge (free trials are generally available).",Diana M Palermo,1:10pm,4:00pm,10495,Morningside,N0220-20212-D02,Photography: The Camera C,Summer High School Program,PHTG,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PHTG/N0220-20212-D02/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,High School Program,0,,MTWRF,20212PHTG0220ND02,LABORATORY

POLS GR8420,"POL CULTURE, PARTICIPTN","The idea that culture influences politics has been a core theme of the modern social sciences. But scholars have debated what culture is, what it influences, and how. The course looks at some of the foundational works in this literature. It then focuses on the stream of research that uses survey research methods and in so doing, focuses on the understanding of political culture as a distribution within a society of values, norms, and attitudes toward political objects. Within this literature, we look at how social scientists using survey research have assessed the impact of political culture on one type of behavior, political participation, and one type of attitude, regime legitimacy. This in turn involves a discussion of the distinction in the literature between democratic and authoritarian regime types, and how they differ with respect to drivers of participation and causes of legitimacy. The course deals with culture, regime type, participation, and legitimacy at both the conceptual and methodological levels. By critiquing prominent works in the field, we will learn more about problems of measurement, question formulation, response category design, and questionnaire design, and about practical problems of gaining access and conducting interviews in various social and political environments. We will develop an appreciation of how sampling techniques affect the reliability of findings, and discuss the possibilities and limits of using non-random and flawed samples.

But we also find it difficult to explain what it means to be reasonable or rational in politics. What is reason? What does it mean to have a reason for a belief or an action? If someone behaves unreasonably, what are they failing to do? Is reason at odds with passion, rhetoric, authority, or religious conviction? Are there spcial ways in which citizens and public officials should reason in public life? Is it realistic to expect people to exercise ""public"" forms of reason in a culturally diverse and politically polarized society that sometimes seems indifferent to rational argument? What is the relationship between ""reasonable"" political discourse and familiar contemporary concepts like ""political correctness""?

PPEC PS0100,Political and Economic Ideologies of the,"This course explores the central political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world, including capitalism, socialism, communism, liberalism, populism, and nationalism. We ask what principles define these ideologies, how these ideologies intersect with democracy, and how they produce and require different meanings and understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship.  Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.  By the end of the three weeks, students are equipped with not only a deeper understanding of the competing political and economic ideologies that shape the modern world, but also with the tools to make, understand, and critically evaluate claims of all kinds—tools which should serve them well both in their future studies and as future citizens and leaders.",Geoffrey C Upton,1:10pm,3:00pm,10499,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,Political & Economic Ideo,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),PPEC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PPEC/K0100-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212PPEC0100KD01,LECTURE

Topics covered include empathy, prejudice, helping, compliance, bullying, conformity, and the development of personality. A variety of psychological methods for predicting and preventing anti-social behavior are discussed.  The course establishes a strong grounding in scientific principles and methodology. Students are encouraged to think about how empirical methods can be used to measure complex social phenomena, to recognize and appreciate experimental rigor, and ultimately to question common assumptions about human behavior found in ordinary discourse and the popular press.  Students typically spend a portion of each day in lecture and a portion in learning activities such as group work, discussion, and hands-on experimentation. Outside of class, in addition to doing assigned reading participants complete homework assignments in which they apply what they have learned to real-world social situations.

orthopedic clinical practice. Contemporary advanced orthopedic clinical practice involves much more than orthopedic knowledge and clinical skills, encompassing medical screening for all major body systems and accurate interpretation and application of the available evidence-base clinical applications into practice. This faculty-guided seminar allows the orthopedic resident to develop clinical evaluation skills that incorporate medical screening and application of evidence-based findings.  Resident will also have the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience by interacting with many health care professionals at New York Presbyterian and Columbia University Medical Center.  This faculty-guided seminar allows the orthopedic resident to refine their ability to determine whether complex cases will benefit from physical therapy through thorough medical screening and interpretation of related diagnostic studies. This will be done initially at the outset of the residency, as the orthopedic residents will first be introduced to standard requirements for New York Presbyterian Hospital clinical practice. This will transition to clinical care as well as getting opportunities to participate in learning opportunities within other sub-specialty clinic settings. To determine the suitability of individuals with complex cases for physical therapy services, residents will develop medical screening abilities through targeted knowledge acquisition, assessment skills, and integration of imaging findings and pharmacology interactions. Residents will spend time within the musculoskeletal radiology service, orthopedics, dental services as well as other orthopedic related clinics to increase the resident’s orthopedic knowledge.  Residents will also document patient cases by diagnostic criteria as well as complete APTA “technique” examinations of the UE, LE and the Spine as determined by ABPTRFE.",,,,13443,Presbyterian Hospital,M9303-20212-083,Ad Ortho Clin Practice,Physical Therapy,PTRN,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/PTRN/M9303-20212-083/,,In-Person,,1,,,20212PTRN9303M083,RESIDENCY

RLPH PS0101,"Divine Beings, Miracles, and the Afterli","This course introduces students to fundamental issues in philosophy of religion. We critically address questions such as the following: (a) Given the diverse range of religions in the world, what is it that makes them all religions? (b) Is it possible for miracles to occur? (c) What is the relationship between science and religion? (d) Is it reasonable to believe in an afterlife for beings like us?  We broach such challenging questions by critically reading and writing about them, and in doing so we fine-tune our own views. The broad objective of the course is to develop and refine students' critical reasoning and writing skills.  Other learning objectives include:  
  
To acquire a richer understanding of and facility with the methodology that philosophers use to answer fundamental questions.
  
To develop an understanding of the different branches of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy.
  
To accurately interpret a wide range of historically influential philosophers’ works on fundamental issues in philosophy of religion, and in doing so sharpen our exegetical skills.

SCNC UN3001,Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Testing: Mar,"The story of the US nuclear weapons testing program in the Marshall Islands can be viewed as the collision of a powerful nuclear weapons state, eager to aggressively pursue a thermonuclear weapons development program, and an indigenous population in a remote location. After World War II, the Marshall Islands became a US territory, as specified by a UN treaty, and the US immediately initiated a testing program to be conducted in the northern expanse of the islands. The testing was done in an overtly public manner and driven at the time by a Cold War mentality. As a result of the testing, the Marshallese people were both driven away from their homes and lands and exposed to radioactive fallout. A classified human subject health monitoring program was implemented under the name Project 4.1. From these tests, the US government was able to study the effects of nuclear fallout and the correlation to cancer rates in the Marshallese population, exposed at different distances from the test sites and over a time period of decades.  This course is about the violent intersection of science and culture. Students will investigate the Marshallese culture prior to the nuclear weapons testing program and then study the ways in which the culture and people were affected by the program. They will also consider the challenges the Marshallese face today. The course will end on a series of group research projects to compare and contrast the Marshall Islands case with those of other indigenous populations affected by nuclear testing performed by other nuclear weapons states. For the course’s final project, the students will apply the tools learned in this course about nuclear weapons and culture and apply them to the French government’s nuclear testing program in either French Polynesians or Algeria.",Emlyn W Hughes,9:00am,10:35am,10304,Morningside,H3001-20212-001,Nuclear Weapons/Testing,Summer Session (SUMM),SCNC,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SCNC/H3001-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MTWR,20212SCNC3001H001,SEMINAR

SNET PS0100,The Networked Self: Identity in the Digi,"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.  Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the “commodified self” and “self-branding.” 2) “Digital surveillance” and the “managed self.” 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically “marginalized” identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.  The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",Timothy Novak,3:10pm,5:00pm,10518,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,The Networked Self,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SNET,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SNET/K0100-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212SNET0100KD01,LECTURE
SOCI BC3202,Structural Determinants of Health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the “Social” Determinants of Health to the “Structural” Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes. An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities. Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual’s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one’s class position and the color of one’s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experience of it.",Maati Momplaisir,5:30pm,8:40pm,00072,Barnard College,X3202-20212-001,STRUCTURAL DETERMNTS OF H,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/X3202-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20212SOCI3202X001,LECTURE

SOCI UN3937,Sociology of Human Rights,"Sociology came to the study of human rights much later than law, philosophy, or political science. In this course, you’ll learn (1) what constitutes a sociology of human rights and (2) what sociology, its classics, and its diverse methods bring to the empirical study and theory of human rights. We’ll explore the history, social institutions and laws, ideas, practices, and theories of human rights. We’ll become familiar with the social actors, social structures, and relationships involved in practices such as violation, claims-making, advocacy, and protection. We’ll consider how social, cultural, political, and economic forces affect human rights issues. We’ll learn about the questions sociologists ask, starting with the most basic (but far from simple) question, “what is a human right?” We’ll tackle key debates in the field, considering – for instance – whether human rights are universal and how human rights relate to cultural norms/values, national sovereignty, and national security. Finally, we’ll apply the concepts we’ve learned to a wide range of issues (ex: how racial, ethnic, gender, and other social inequalities relate to human rights), rights (ex: LGBTQ rights, the rights of laborers, the rights of refugees), and cases (ex: enslavement, the separation of children from their families, circumcision, sterilization, the use of torture).

SOCW T7601,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILLS,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment that was originally developed for chronically suicidal individuals and is now the gold standard treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder.  The treatment and its adaptations have since been proven through research to be effective across a wide range of disorders and behavioral problems which have at their core the issue of Pervasive Emotion Dysregulation.   Students will be introduced to key theoretical concepts that inform the “spirit” of DBT, along with an overview of core treatment strategies as used within a DBT skills group. This course is focused on DBT skills, and will provide students with a basic understanding of the four DBT skills modules (Core Mindfulness, Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation, Distress Tolerance). The focus will be on the revised and expanded DBT Skills Manual released in late 2014.  Through course assignments and in-class activities, students will have an opportunity to learn the content of the skills, as well as how to structure and conduct a DBT skills group.   Students will develop a beginning understanding of standard comprehensive DBT, the particular function of each treatment component, (e.g., individual, group, consultation team, coaching) and how DBT skills relate to the other program components. The basic format of this course will include the Instructor's presentation of concepts and principles, group discussion, modeling, role-plays, and technique coaching.  As a practice elective, the major focus is on skill development.  As such, students are expected participate fully in in-class practice exercises and be receptive to feedback from their classmates.",Kitama S Cahill-Jackson,7:30pm,10:00pm,12231,Morningside,T7601-20212-001,INTRODUCTION TO DBT SKILL,Social Work,SOCW,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCW/T7601-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,T,20212SOCW7601T001,SEMINAR

It is designed to prepare students for intensive DBT training and for their DBT internships in the community and for ensuring that program interns are prepared for beginning DBT practice with client populations exhibiting a range of behavioral dysfunctions. These range from mild problems in living that may benefit from DBT skills training to more complex disorders, including suicidal behaviors, requiring comprehensive DBT. It is understood that students enter this program with varying levels of competence and experience in mental health practice and that ongoing individual assessment between the student and instructor play an ongoing role throughout the DBT Training Program, beginning in this class.

SPAN BC3900,Crime and Culture in Modern Spain,"The death of absolutist King Fernando VII in 1833 constituted the end of Spain’s 
Antiguo Régimen
, and ushered in the arrival of a constitutional monarchy. The country soon furnished itself with the requisite trappings of modernity, including a liberal juridical system intended to turn subjects into citizens and replace the Black Legend of the obscurantist, Catholic empire with the image of a modern state organized around the rule of law. Inspired by a literature emerging in Europe and the United States as the symbolic counterpart of this turn to ideals of order and reason, Spanish writers tried their hand at appropriating its conventions throughout a century of domestic political turmoil stretching from the First and Second Republics (1868-74 and 1932-36) to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939-75) and the transition to democracy soon after his death. In their own crime and detection novels, Spanish authors probed the contours of the nation’s uneven political and cultural evolution.

SREL PS0101,Explorations in Physics: Special Relativ,"This course offers an intensive exploration of one of the fundamental principle of physics –relativity. Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.  Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein’s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe.  In the process of exploring these challenging topics, course participants expand their capacity for creative problem solving and their ability to think critically and independently.",Yury Dziashko,1:10pm,3:00pm,10519,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,Special Relativity,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),SREL,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SREL/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212SREL0101ND01,LECTURE

The course focuses on the interchange between the external legal, competitive, societal, environmental and policy ‘ecosystems’ corporations face (which vary around the world) and a company’s internal structure, operations and pressures. We will use the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Global Compact Principles (which incorporate all aspects of ESG) as the central frameworks to explore the concept of a corporation’s responsibility to respect and remedy human rights and environmental harms.  We will also examine the Equator Principles and other frameworks that spell out good practices for project finance and other investment decisions, and reference a wide range of the myriad indices, supplier disclosure portals and benchmarks that exist in this inter-disciplinary field.  Relevant regulations, corporate law regimes and court cases will be discussed from the point of view of what business managers need to know.

SUMA PS5770,SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT,"The course intends to give an overview of forests – how they function, and how they can be managed sustainably. The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.  The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.  For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival. The course is going to emphasize the role of forests in the carbon cycle and the contribution of deforestation to climate change.",Ralph C Schmidt,6:10pm,8:00pm,10157,Morningside,K5770-20212-H01,THE BUSINESS OF SUSTAINAB,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K5770-20212-H01/,501 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],Hybrid,"Engineering:Graduate

TCOL PS0101,"Creating Original Theater: Playwriting,","Designed for students with experience in drama who are interested in developing original theatrical productions, the course emphasizes the working relationship between actor, director, and playwright, and the unique dynamic that exists between them when working on untried material.  Workshops and lectures during the first week introduce students to the demands of play development. Students then elect to specialize in one of three areas: acting, directing, or playwriting. The remainder of the course is given over to the development of short plays to be written, directed, and acted by the students under the supervision of theatrical professionals. In small, autonomous groups of actors, each with its own director and playwright, students create a production to be mounted at the end of the program.  Workshops are interactive, with the evolving pieces of each play periodically shown to the entire group for feedback in a safe, supportive environment.

TELE PS0101,"Creating Television: Pitching, Writing,","Students learn how to develop their own TV shows in this hands-on course. The focus is on writing for television, which is at the heart of the creative process, but we also look at the history of the medium, how to pitch a show, and production. Ultimately participants film mini-pilots or key scenes from the shows they have developed.
 
 We begin with a brief history of television in the United States – its creation and how it has grown over the past seven decades. Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or “reality”) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.
 
 While learning about the “TV greats,” students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers’ medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.
 
 The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",Mark A Christopher,3:10pm,5:00pm,10525,Morningside,N0101-20212-D01,Creating Television,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),TELE,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/TELE/N0101-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212TELE0101ND01,LECTURE

TRAD PS0218,Trial Advocacy,"Designed for students with a strong interest in law, oral argument, and mock trial, this course immerses participants in the adversarial world of the trial court.  Following an introduction to the United States legal system, students acquire a solid understanding of the trial process, including jury selection, opening statements, direct and cross examination of witnesses and experts, introduction of exhibits, closing arguments, and theory building. Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.  Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.  The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.  Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently. At the heart of the program are daily exercises, designed to hone students' trial skills, that are rooted in a hypothetical legal case.  The program culminates in a mock trial session held at the U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Manhattan, where students are divided into teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to present their case, prepared over the course of the program, through jury verdict.",,1:10pm,3:00pm,10526,Morningside,N0218-20212-D01,,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),TRAD,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/TRAD/N0218-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212TRAD0218ND01,LECTURE
TRRR PS0101,Issues in Terrorism and Counterterrorism,"This course provides an introduction to central debates about terrorism and how it can and should be combatted. We begin with a general overview of debates about terrorism and its definition. We then explore four major debates about terrorism and counterterrorism policy, namely:  
  
Root causes and effectiveness:
 What are the root causes of terrorism? When, if ever, is terrorism an effective strategy?
   
  
War and crime:
 Is counterterrorism generally best approached on the model of law enforcement? When, if ever, is counterterrorism best approached on the model of war? What are the pros and cons of each approach? This unit will focus on the debate about targeted killings in the United States and Israel.
   
  
Torture:
 Is the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” ever justified? Do the exigencies of counterterrorism require that certain techniques be brought within the bounds of the law? This unit will focus on debates in the United States and more recently in Israel.
   
  
Surveillance:
 How should counterterrorism policy strike a balance between security and privacy? This unit will focus on recent debates about surveillance programs in the United States and the United Kingdom.

UKRN GU4033,FIN DE SIECLE UKRAINIAN LIT,"The course focuses on the emergence of modernism in Ukrainian literature in the late 19th century and early 20th century, a period marked by a vigorous, often biting, polemic between the populist Ukrainian literary establishment and young Ukrainian writers who were inspired by their European counterparts. Students will read prose, poetry, and drama written by Ivan Franko, the writers of the Moloda Muza, Olha Kobylianska, Lesia Ukrainka, and Volodymyr Vynnychenko among others. The course will trace the introduction of feminism, urban motifs and settings, as well as decadence, into Ukrainian literature and will analyze the conflict that ensued among Ukrainian intellectuals as they shaped the identity of the Ukrainian people.

URBS S1517,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STUDIES,"This course is intended to be both an interdisciplinary introduction to the city and to the field of Urban Studies. As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field. Students in the course will approach cities from a number of disciplines, not only through the reading, but also through assignments that take place in different locations throughout New York City.",Mary Rocco,1:00pm,4:10pm,11139,Morningside,S1517-20212-001,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STU,Summer Session (SUMM),URBS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBS/S1517-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212URBS1517S001,LECTURE
URBS S3311,"RACE, SPACE AND URBAN SCHOOLS","Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools.  And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who look very much like ourselves.  In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly racially diverse.  In this class, we will use public schools in New York as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions.
 
 We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the relationships between city schools and their local contexts?  What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”?  How are spaces inside of schools racialized?  We will use ethnographies, narrative nonfiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives.  You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.
 
 This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.",Chandler Miranda,1:00pm,4:10pm,12147,Morningside,S3311-20212-001,"RACE, SPACE AND URBAN SCH",Summer Session (SUMM),URBS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBS/S3311-20212-001/,614 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],Hybrid,,3,,TR,20212URBS3311S001,COLLOQUIA
URBS UN3308,INTRO TO URBAN ETHNOGRAPHIES,"What is ethnography and what makes ethnography “urban”? This course explores how social scientists use ethnography to analyze questions and dilemmas often associated with urban settings. We will combine close readings of ethnographies with field-based inquiry, including our own studies of urban public space. Through both our readings and our field exercises, we will focus on the methods at the heart of ethnography: observation and participant-observation.  As we read other scholars’ work, we will ask how the author uses ethnographic tools to explore issues that are suitable for intensive fieldwork. We will assess which kinds of research problems and theoretical perspectives are a good fit with ethnography and the roles that ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects. You will apply what you have learned about research to design your own pilot fieldwork. The ethnographies that we read together will examine intersections of housing, race, and class in urban communities. You are welcome to extend this focus to your own fieldwork, but it’s not required to do so. This is a writing-intensive course, and we will devote a considerable portion of class time to workshop your individual projects.",Chandler Miranda,1:10pm,4:00pm,00202,Barnard College,V3308-20212-001,INTRO/URBAN ETHNOGRAPHIES,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/URBS/V3308-20212-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20212URBS3308V001,COLLOQUIA
URBS UN3315,METROPOLITICS OF RACE & PLACE,"This class explores how racism and racialized capitalism and politics shape the distribution of material resources among cities and suburbs in metropolitan areas and the racial and ethnic groups residing in them. Readings and discussion focus on the history of metropolitan area expansion and economic development, as well as contemporary social processes shaping racial and ethnic groups’ access to high-quality public goods and private amenities. We address racial and ethnic groups’ evolving political agendas in today’s increasingly market-driven socio-political context, noting the roles of residents; federal, state, and local governments; market institutions and actors; urban planners, activist organizations, foundations, and social scientists, among others. Here is a sample of specific topics: race/ethnicity and who “belongs” in what “place;” inequitable government and market investment across racial and ethnic communities over time and “sedimentation effects” (for example, the “redlining” of Black communities leading to their inability to access loan and credit markets and the resulting wealth gap between Blacks and Whites); gentrification processes; creating sufficient, sustainable tax bases; and suburban sprawl.

While we will focus primarily on the past 30 to 40 years in New York City, we will consider the history of homelessness and housing in the United States since the Great Depression. Major themes will include criminalization, origin myths, and representations of people who are experiencing homelessness. Key questions will include: In what ways is the current geography of homelessness the result of historical patterns of racism and discrimination? How does studying homelessness provide insight into the ways urban spaces are made? Why have shelters become the primary public response to homelessness in New York? How are race and gender central to the project of building a shelter infrastructure in New York? How are shelters experienced by those living in them?

How is its transformation attenuated when the body is in formation with other bodies, a breathing still life of people and props? This performance art course will use the question of a body’s stillness as a platform to create interdisciplinary projects that exist between dance, sculpture, collaborative movement, and performance art. Through core readings and case study presentations, we will discuss unique possibilities of representation and challenges this form enables, and the prominent role it has been taking within the visual arts in recent years. Students will engage with a variety of aesthetic strategies and formal techniques such as movement workshops, sensory exercises, video, wearable sculptures, collaboration, scores, and group meditation. Studio work will focus on concrete intersections between the body and the object, and case studies chosen to encourage students to think of movement as a form of resistance, and to consider the political implication of collaborative work that unfolds over time.

WARS PS0100,International Humanitarian Law: Regulati,"Is international humanitarian law (IHL) still relevant in regulating warfare in the 21st Century? Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.  In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.  In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.  Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film.

: 5 semesters of college-level French or the equivalent.  This course in taught in French.  
Eligibility:
  This course is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and visiting students  Based on an interdisciplinary, intersectional, subalternist and post-colonial approach, this course is a general introduction to the history, sociology and anthropology of the economy of the sex-trade in Africa, America, Asia and Europe from the early nineteenth century to today. It aims to clarify: 1) the historiographical situation by questioning and analyzing the French regulatory system and its many avatars in Europe, the United States and in the colonial world, but also questioning the backlash to this system that consisted firstly of the abolitionist (born in England in the second half of the nineteenth century) and then the prohibitionist movements; 2) The relationship between class, “race” and gender in the sex market via issues of human trafficking and sex tourism in Europe, America, Africa and Asia; 3) The socio-economic issue - and its political connections – in the economy of sex with particular attention to individuals (prostitutes versus sex workers), their voices, their legal status, and even their mobilization (rallies and demonstrations, community collectives and trade unions, political and / or literary publications), but also the many heated debates that these demands for recognition and these mobilizations have provoked in places as diverse as France, the Netherlands and India to take only three specific examples in the world covered in the course.

WMST UN3225,TRANSGENDER STUDIES - THEMES AND TOPICS,"This course introduces the interdisciplinary field of transgender studies. While we will read about gender variable bodies within a long historical arc, the categories of both “transsexual” and ""transgender"" are recent social constructions. How did the many different forms of gender variance resolve into these singular forms and what has been lost in the medical and legal narrowing of gender variance to only these forms? Can we make any connections between witches in the 17th century (often accused on the grounds of cross-gender identification), mollies and dandies in the 19th century (often marked as effeminate), inverts in the late 19th and early 20th century and later constructions that assemble under the banner of “trans*”?  Many academic disciplines-- including anthropology, history, gender studies, literary studies, and gay and lesbian/queer studies--have studied transgender identities, bodies and communities, but only very recently has the field become institutionalized in the academy as a discipline ""Transgender Studies."" In this course we examine the ongoing development of the concept of transgender as it is situated across social, cultural, historical, medical, and political contexts. Along the way, we will try to answer some fundamental questions: when did trans* emerge as a distinct social formation? What might be the differences between the understanding of gender variance in the second half of the 20th century and formulations of the phenomena of cross-dressing and passing and transvestism in earlier periods?

By exploring these changes in the works of scholars like Tim Wu and Bernard Harcourt we will gain a deeper sense of contemporary sexual politics in “expository society” as we determine the criteria for evaluating the success of the modern celebrity. Finally, we will consider how the celebrity reality tv industrial-complex shifts notions of sex, power, and god by exploring the emergence of icons “famous for being famous” in the 21st century whose command of attention and social influence in the digital age represents power, capital, and divine myth befitting a queen: Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian West.",,,,00248,Barnard College,S0101-20212-001,,Pre-College Program (Barnard),WOMP,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WOMP/S0101-20212-001/,,,,0,,,20212WOMP0101S001,SEMINAR

WRIT S4313,WRITING CHILDREN'S BOOKS,"There are many misconceptions as to what makes an appealing story for children and how to get a story published. Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",Peter Catalanotto,9:00am,12:10pm,11228,Morningside,S4313-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Catalanotto,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4313-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212WRIT4313S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,5:30pm,8:40pm,11217,Morningside,S4320-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4320-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212WRIT4320S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",Rachel E Carter,5:30pm,8:40pm,11222,Morningside,S4323-20212-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,TR,20212WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR

Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors.

WRIT UN3215,ART WRITING FOR WRITERS,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required.   In this course, we will look at some of the most dynamic examples of ""visual writing."" To begin, we will look at writers writing about art, from the Romantic period through the present. The modes of this art writing we will consider include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which address or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, John Ashbery, and Eileen Myles, who for periods of their lives worked as art critics; writers such as Etel Adnan and Alexander Kulge, who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure; as well as numerous collaborations between writers and visual artists. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers, like artists Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, David Wojnarowicz, Moyra Davey, Paul Chan, and Hannah Black, as well as professional critics whose work has been elevated to the status of literature, such as Hilton Als, Janet Malcolm, and Susan Sontag. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of sonic and visual artists, such as those associated with Dada, the Harlem Renaissance, the New York School, and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course, students will also be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. They will produce original works in various of the modes described above and complete a final writing project that incorporates what they have learned.",Thomas A Donovan,5:30pm,8:40pm,11223,Morningside,W3215-20212-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/W3215-20212-001/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,3,,MW,20212WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR

ZOO_ PS0100,Inside the Animal Mind: What Animals Thi,"Do rats laugh? Do dogs pretend? Can birds use tools? While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.  This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology—the study of animal minds—and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin’s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the “father of cognitive ethology,” whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.  In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson. These pioneering researchers fundamentally changed our understanding of the animal mind, shedding new light on the extraordinary and diverse abilities of our fellow species to learn, problem-solve, use tools, express emotions, and even mourn their dead. What’s more, we are learning that animals communicate complex information in ways we could never have imagined.  Field excursions to locations such as the Central Park Zoo, the Wild Bird Fund, and the Wolf Conservation Center offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behaviors up close, emulate observation techniques used by scientists in the field, and speak to experts about their research. These first-hand experiences provide context for the material covered in class, and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions. Students also have an opportunity to explore the broad array of academic and career paths that relate to cognitive ethology, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, conservation biology, psychology, philosophy and ethics, co",Michelle A Ashkin,3:10pm,5:00pm,10545,Morningside,K0100-20212-D01,Inside the Animal Mind,Pre-College Programs (SHSP),ZOO_,,,,,http://www.columbia.edu//cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ZOO_/K0100-20212-D01/,ONLINE ONLY,On-Line Only,,0,,MTWRF,20212ZOO_0100KD01,LECTURE
