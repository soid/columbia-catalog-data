ANTH S3009,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF ISLAM,"This course centers on the constantly changing ambivalent everyday lived realities, experiences, interpretations as well as the multiple meanings of Islam and focuses less on the study of Islam as a discursive tradition. Furthermore, the course challenges stereotypes of Islam, and of people who one way or another can be called Muslims; most often perceived as a homogenous category through which all Muslim societies are imagined. The course is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the idea of “anthropology of Islam” through different readings in anthropology and various, experiences, practices, dimensions of Islam as a relationship between humans and God. In the second part, the focus is to listen to Islam and connect the different sonic bodies of Islam to power and politics. The third part interrogates preconceived ideas about Islam, gender, feminism, and agency. The fourth part studies Islam, body, sexuality and eroticism. The fifth part is concerned with Islam, youth culture, identity, belonging and rebellion. The last part critically analyzes Islam, modernity, orientalism, post-colonialism and not least today’s fear and notion of imagined enemies.",Saphe Shamoun,1:00pm,4:10pm,10300,,S3009-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/S3009-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262ANTH3009S001,LECTURE
ANTH S3722,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VIOLENCE,"This course will explore contemporary anthropological approaches to the issue of violence with an exploration of three particular themes. Our main focus will be on the idea of representation, ethnographically and theoretically, of the concept of violence. First, we will look at how violence has been situated as an object of study within anthropology, as a theoretical concept as well as in practice. We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality. We will pay particular attention to the concept of the 'Muslim woman' in both the colonial and colonized imagination.",Rishav Kumar Thakur,5:30pm,8:40pm,10467,,S3722-20262-001,THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VIOLE,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/S3722-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262ANTH3722S001,LECTURE

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",Lien Van Geel,1:00pm,4:10pm,10370,,S3058-20262-001,Worlds of Alexander the G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/S3058-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262CLCV3058S001,LECTURE

CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.
 
 All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages
 is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to
 consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request. This course will be of interest to those
 majoring in Slavic and/or Jewish Studies, as well as anyone interested in Comparative Literature, History, Art
 History, and Film and Visual Studies.",Alex Pekov,5:30pm,8:40pm,10446,,W4013-20262-001,Jewish Worlds in Eastern,Summer Session (SUMM),CLSL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLSL/W4013-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262CLSL4013W001,LECTURE

EESC S1004,Dinosaurs and the History of Life,"Dinosaurs  
explores how science works and provide practical knowledge about the history of life and how we have come to understand it. We learn how to analyze the evolutionary relationships of organisms and examine how dinosaurs came to be exemplars of a very successful group of organisms dominant on land for 140 million years. We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a “hot-house world”, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future. The non-avian dinosaur met their end in a remarkable cataclysm discovered by detective work that we will delve deeply into as a paradigm of the scientific method  Finally, they are fun and spectacular - monsters more fantastic than any person has invented in legend or religion - and they are still with us!",Paul E Olsen,1:00pm,4:10pm,10265,,S1004-20262-001,Dinos and the History of,Summer Session (SUMM),EESC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EESC/S1004-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262EESC1004S001,LECTURE

FILM S3023,VIDEO GAMES AND FILM,"Cinema and videogames are moving-image-based media, and, especially over the past two decades, they have been credited with influencing each other. But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms. The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums. The course will culminate in a final presentation where students will adapt an existing intellectual property, preferably a film or TV show, into a video game (or vice versa), justifying their creative choices.",,,,10303,,S3023-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3023-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262FILM3023S001,SEMINAR

FILM S4215,CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL DOCUMENTAR,"Documentaries are proliferating with increasing intensity around the world. They circulate as market commodities, forms of entertainment, and vehicles for social change. In this class we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary, including projects created within the media industries of China, Cambodia, Chechnya, Ukraine, Nigeria, and India. We will also examine the presence of “the global” within the United States, which involves exploring questions of immigration, border-crossing, and transnational co-production. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (AI, virtual and augmented reality), star-studded film festivals, and the reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda. Guest speakers (scholars, filmmakers, programmers) working in the field will enrich our class discussions. Site visits will offer the opportunity to engage with documentary through the cultural offerings of the city.

FILM UN3025,Narrative Design for Games and Interacti,"Traditionally, stories have followed a linear path, with a clear distinction between teller and audience. Yet, since the late 20th century, this model is shifting. Today, postmodern fiction, video games, interactive films, VR, participatory theater and immersive experiences offer audiences agency, creating a challenge for creators: how do they uphold narrative integrity while allowing for choice, collaboration, and remixing?
  
In this class, we’ll examine how modern narrative designers craft stories across media that invite audience participation. Through history, analysis, and workshops, we’ll explore how creators design for interaction while preserving tone and themes, turning audiences into active participants.
  
For the final assignment, students will develop a 12-15 minute pitch presentation for an original story concept, adapting it into an interactive format that balances strong authorial vision with audience agency.",,,,10304,,S3025-20262-001,Narr Design for Games & I,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3025-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262FILM3025S001,SEMINAR

INTL S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10393,,S6559-20262-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6559-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262INTL6559S001,SEMINAR

We pay particular attention to the recurring tensions that run through American foreign policy: isolationism v. internationalism, security v. prosperity, diplomacy v. military power, unilateralism v. multilateralism, and realism v. idealism.

INTL S6797,SPECIAL OPERATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY,"Special Operations are typically defined as national security actions in hostile, denied, or sensitive environments, and often require covert, clandestine, or low-visibility approaches. From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:10pm,10414,,W1001-20262-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W1001-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20262MDES1001W001,LECTURE

QMSS GR5067,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING SOCIAL SCIENCES,"Social scientists need to engage with natural language processing (NLP) approaches that are found in computer science, engineering, AI, tech and in industry. This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",Patrick Houlihan,5:30pm,8:40pm,10422,,G5067-20262-001,NATURAL LANG PROCESSING S,Summer Session (SUMM),QMSS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/QMSS/G5067-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MT,20262QMSS5067G001,SEMINAR
QMSS GR5075,Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Social Sc,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI – like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Gemini – are poised to change the world for everyone. It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class – through readings and a dozen hands-on activities – students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI’s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people’s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI’s “weirdness.” Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills – like in critical thinking and empathy – in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, “So far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1/36th of the time, thanks to AI. AI is wild!"" By the end of this class, students will feel empowered technically and philosophically to handle all new generative AI developments.

This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts.

WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing.

We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",Emily K Austin,10:00am,1:10pm,10380,,S4323-20262-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4323-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4324,MISFITS AND MISANTHROPES,"People like to be liked. And writers obsess about likability in fiction. But is it that important? What about visionaries, iconoclasts, stragglers, strangers, weirdos, and cringe-inducers? What happens when there is friction between a person and their surroundings? Between people? What if a character throws aside motivations to be liked and impulses to comply?
  
At its heart, this is a class focused on analyzing and crafting characters. We’ll look at loners and lonely hearts, articulate big mouths, and introverted self-imploders. We’ll observe their circumstances and question how their desires encourage them to think and act. Students will regularly respond to prompts and workshop their own writing.
  
Our discussions will consider what choices writers make to render, shape, define, and refine characters. We’ll take on craft-oriented concerns such as: How is dialogue used to differentiate characters? How does a writer demonstrate a character’s compassion, even if their attitude stinks? How do the story's events affect the reader’s understanding of character? What elements in the narrative change—or don’t—over time to signal to the reader that a character is developing?
  
Throughout, students will investigate how emerging writers move from maintaining characters’ status quo and progress to allowing characters to do the unexpected. With every question, we will advance our comprehension of building dynamic representations of people in the world, how they act out, and what it takes to fit in.

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,1:30pm,4:40pm,10382,,S4810-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:30pm,4:40pm,10377,,W3215-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
