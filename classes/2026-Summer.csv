AHIS S2314,MASTERS OF THE BAROQUE,"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art—Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Velázquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)—artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",Lindsey P Schneider,1:00pm,4:10pm,10572,,S2314-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/S2314-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262AHIS2314S001,LECTURE

AHIS S3106,Archaic Greek Ceramics,"This course explores the functions and meanings of Greek painted ceramics made in the sixth century BCE, taking the collections of the Metropolitan Museum as its focus. Today these vessels are enshrined in display cases and elevated as art objects. But what roles did they play for the ancient people who used them? Who made them, and how? What substances did they hold? What did their decorations mean? Why were they acquired by people living thousands of miles away from where they were made? We will examine the overlapping roles of Archaic Greek vessels as functional containers, artistic creations, ancient commodities, and modern collectors’ items. Rather than foregrounding Athenian vases, we will consider them alongside Boeotian, Corinthian, Chalcidian, East Greek, and Laconian vessels to better understand the many roles ceramics played across the Greek world. The relationship between Greek ceramics and those created by neighboring cultures including the Etruscans and Egyptians will be discussed. Emphasis will be placed on understanding Greek vessels as objects that connected different cultures as they moved through the Mediterranean.",Monica K Bulger,1:00pm,4:10pm,10657,,S3106-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/S3106-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262AHIS3106S001,SEMINAR
AHIS S3107,Constructing the Sacred in Ancient Greec,"This course examines the conception and spatialization of religious experience in ancient Greece through brief chronological surveys and thematic case studies. Definitions of “sacred,” “ritual,” and “divine” will frame lectures and class discussions on cult locations and religious architecture in mainland Greece and western Asia Minor from the Archaic (8th century BCE) to the Early Roman Imperial (2nd century CE) periods.
  
The architectural articulation of sanctuaries will be observed in relation to socio-political, historical, and artistic conditions in which these spaces were formed and existed. Case studies will involve both conventional (e.g., athletic) and idiosyncratic (e.g., healing, mystery performances) cult practices.
  
The second half of the summer session will focus on the materiality of the sacred through smallscale dedications and will make use of the vast collections of the Metropolitan Museum. Finally, we will observe NYC’s urban fabric in walking tours where we consider Greek Revival architecture and phenomena such as continuity, transformation, de-sacralization, and secularization.",Muge Arseven,1:00pm,4:10pm,10581,,W3107-20262-001,Constructing the Sacred,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3107-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262AHIS3107W001,SEMINAR

AHIS S3441,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MUSEUM,"This course will introduce students to the history of museums and display practices through New York collections. The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts.

Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the ""long"" nineteenth century, and how events of the period continue to impact our country today. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the radical changes that occurred during the Civil War.  With many sessions taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad.",Page S Knox,9:00am,12:10pm,10574,,S3442-20262-001,"American Art, 1750-1914",Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/S3442-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20262AHIS3442S001,SEMINAR
AHIS S3448,"Theories, Methods, and Experiments in Ar","The use of artificial intelligence—propelled by deep learning techniques—to analyze, curate, and generate digital images is having a profound influence on visual culture, one that well exceeds Jacques Derrida's anticipations of the effects of technology on society as he described them in Archive Fever. While regulation around emerging technologies such as AI is being formulated across the globe with much urgency, a problematic concept of “tech ethics” is being espoused by the leading technology companies that imposes a simplistic moralistic framework on potential policies. Through examination of the creative applications of AI, the aim of this seminar is to foster a nuanced critical discourse on AI art that places the ethics of emerging technologies at center stage. This course provides students with an introduction to the history of AI art and explores the challenges and opportunities that this burgeoning field faces, especially in regard to the regulation of technology. Class visits to Mercer Labs, Artechouse, MoMA, and the Whitney will allow students to directly engage with the core concepts of the seminar.
  
The course begins with reflection on Adorno’s prescient statement that technical rationality is “the rationality of domination,” and challenges both the cynicism and optimism around emerging technologies and their effect on visual culture. We will question the accountability that art history and other fields of study have, if any, to steer the ethics debates spurred by today’s “culture industry” of digital images, and ask what the custodianship of this space entails by examining its structures of power, conveyed visually or through automated processes enabled by computer vision science. By interrogating the socio-cultural effects of the use of machine learning on images—such as algorithmic biases that lend to discrimination, or surveillance and privacy concerns in regard to facial recognition technologies—new and diverse perspectives on visual culture are investigated. Although the mechanisms that enable technology to develop may be lending to the commodification and homogenization of visual culture, the seemingly democratic promises that big tech touts keep us captivated yet surprisingly uncritical. If the transformative role of AI on our visual culture is constituting a new type of archaeology of knowledge, how do we critically lend to its discourse through the theories, methods, and experiments surrounding art and AI?",Emily Spratt,1:00pm,4:10pm,10582,,W3448-20262-001,Theories in Art and AI,Summer Session (SUMM),AHIS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3448-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262AHIS3448W001,SEMINAR

Furthermore, the course challenges stereotypes of Islam, and of people who one way or another can be called Muslims; most often perceived as a homogenous category through which all Muslim societies are imagined. The course is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the idea of “anthropology of Islam” through different readings in anthropology and various, experiences, practices, dimensions of Islam as a relationship between humans and God. In the second part, the focus is to listen to Islam and connect the different sonic bodies of Islam to power and politics. The third part interrogates preconceived ideas about Islam, gender, feminism, and agency. The fourth part studies Islam, body, sexuality and eroticism. The fifth part is concerned with Islam, youth culture, identity, belonging and rebellion.

First, we will look at how violence has been situated as an object of study within anthropology, as a theoretical concept as well as in practice. We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality.

Anthropology encourages us to consider water in its myriad arrangements and meanings—water can be dynamic, vital, threatening, toxic, a material through which our lives are structured and governed. Its relevance has only become heightened amid the constraints and hazards of climatic and sociopolitical change. We will be attentive to the many forms and combinations that characterize water’s place in our world, finding inspiration in its liquid ways while taking care not to become too occupied with its metaphorical qualities. The course is divided into thematic areas that have taken on critical weight and urgency in recent years: water futures, infrastructure and power, urban ecologies, and (de)colonial waters.",Stephanie M Ratte,9:00am,12:10pm,10647,,W3766-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3766-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262ANTH3766W001,SEMINAR

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.",Lien Van Geel,1:00pm,4:10pm,10370,,S3058-20262-001,Worlds of Alexander the G,Summer Session (SUMM),CLCV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/S3058-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262CLCV3058S001,LECTURE

The Laughter of Medusa
, Hélène Cixous compared women’s writing—in French, “écriture féminine”—to the unexplored African continent. To date, literary criticism has been grappling with the distinct qualities of literary works, crafted by women. This course offers a survey of main autofictional works and memoirs, written originally in the Russian language within the last 100 years. We will start our journey with the tumults of the WW1 and the Bolshevik Revolution, the Civil War, through the WW2, the Soviet dissident movement, the emigration waves into Israel and the United States, the advent of a post-socialist Russia in 1991—in order to arrive at the two plus decades of Vladimir Putin’s presidency. We will consider  the ways in which each author transposes and conveys her own—and others’ memories—through the medium of autofiction, defined by Serge Doubrovsky, who coined the term in French, as “the adventure of the language, outside of wisdom and the syntax of the novel.” All selected works, with very few exceptions, are available in English;  no reading knowledge of Russian is required.

CLSL GU4013,Jewish Worlds in Eastern Europe: A Journ,"Pushing back against this trope of homelessness, this course illuminates the robust, vibrant, and multifacetted
 qualities of a home in the Diaspora, lasting for over a millennium, that both Ashkenazi and Sephardi
 Jews managed to create for themselves in lands, predominantly populated by Slavs. They did so despite the
 many constraints of legal and religious discrimination, threats of physical violence, displacement, and countless
 forms of exclusion from dominant society. Moving across centuries, countries, and languages, we will revisit the
 contributions of the Jews to their so called “host cultures” by way of diverse media—literary and non-fictional
 works, memoirs, artistic works, songs, feature and documentary films, journalistic pieces, and more. By the end
 of this journey, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the ways in which the Jews and Slavs have been
 intimately imbricated and intertwined since times immemorial.
 
 All course materials are available in English. No reading knowledge of Russian or other Slavic languages
 is required. Course participants with the reading knowledge of any region-specific language are encouraged to
 consult the respective originals, provided by the instructor upon request. This course will be of interest to those
 majoring in Slavic and/or Jewish Studies, as well as anyone interested in Comparative Literature, History, Art

We will delve deeply into how direct descendants of small carnivorous theropod dinosaurs evolved into birds, still more diverse than mammals, dominating the air. The Mesozoic, a “hot-house world”, with no ice caps and was the kind of world we are hurtling towards because of our input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we will look at how their time is a natural experiment for our future.

ENGL S3233,SHAKESPEARE,"This course provides an introduction to Shakespeare through a combination of reading his plays and viewing them in performance. On the one hand, we approach each play as a written, published text: our in-class conversation consist primarily in close analysis of key passages, and, in one class period, we visit Rare Books to examine the earliest printed versions of the plays in light of English Renaissance print technology. On the other hand, we view performances of each assigned play, including the attendance as a group of at least one Shakespeare production on an NYC stage. Our semester’s through line is to trace, from his earliest plays to Hamlet, Shakespeare’s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human. We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.

ENGL S3273,WALT WHITMAN AND NEW YORK,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York. But he was the first of many to let New York write him. By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta. Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",,,,10486,,S3273-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3273-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3273S001,LECTURE
ENGL S3782,WHEN AMERICAN TELEVISION BECAME AMERICAN,"In a 2015 interview with David Simon (creator of 
The Wire
) President Barak Obama offered that 
The Wire 
is, ""one of the greatest -- not just television shows, but pieces of American art in the last couple of decades.""  
The Wire 
combines hyperrealism (from a-quasi anthropological capture of syntax and dialect that recalls the language of Langston Hughes and Zora Neal Hurston to a preference for actors who lived “the game” in Baltimore’s inner city) with the reinvention of fundamental American themes (from picaresque individualisms, to coming to terms with the illusory “American dream”, to a fundamental loss of faith in American institutions), and engages in a scathing expose of the shared dysfunction among the bureaucracies (police, courts, public schools etc.) that manage a troubled American inner city.  On a more macro level 
The Wire
 humanizes (and therefore vastly problematizes) assumptions about the individual Americans’ who inhabit America’s most dangerous urban environments from gang members to police officers to teachers and even ordinary citizens.
  
The Wire
, of course, did not single-handedly reshape American television. Scholars like Martin Shuster refer to this period of television history as “new television.” That is, the product of new imaginations that felt television had exhausted its normative points of reference, subject matter and narrative technique. Many of the shows from this period sought to reinvent television for interaction with an evolving zeitgeist shaped by shared dissolution with 21st century American life: “I’d been thinking: it’s good to be in a thing from the ground floor, I came too late for that, I know.  But lately I’m getting the feeling I might be in at the end.  That the best is over,” Tony Soprano confides to Dr. Malfi in S1.E1 of the Sopranos.  Series that fall within this rubric include (in chronological order):

ENGL S3915,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"“Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.”― Michel de Montaigne “There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard, The Writing Life “Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",,,,10629,,S3915-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/S3915-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3915S001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3048,British Literature to 1500,"This course will introduce some of the most fascinating texts of the first eight hundred years of English literature, from the period of Anglo-Saxon rule through the Hundred Years’ War and beyond—roughly, 700–1500 CE. We’ll hit on some texts you’ve heard of – 
Beowulf
 and selections from Chaucer’s 
Canterbury Tales
 – while leaving time for some you may not have encountered – Marie de France’s 
Lais
 and Margery of Kempe’s 
Book
. Along the way, we’ll also hone skills of reading, writing, and oral expression crucial to appreciating and discussing literature in nuanced, supple ways. 
  
If you take this course, you’ll discover how medieval literature is both a mirror and a foil to modern literature. You’ll explore the plurilingual and cross-cultural nature of medieval literary production and improve (or acquire!) your knowledge of Middle English. Plus, you’ll flex your writing muscles with two papers.",,,,10484,,W3048-20262-001,British Literature to 150,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3048-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3048W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3049,Victorian Crime Stoppers,"Who were the crime stoppers of the nineteenth century, a century marked by the establishment of the police force? 
In 1829, Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel founded the Metropolitan Police, giving rise to the slang nicknames “Bobbies” for constables in England and “Peelers” in Ireland, terms that are still recognized today. In this course we move from the seemingly absent institutionalized justice system in representations of crime in fiction (
Oliver Twist
) to its codification in the press (
The Illustrated Police News, Penny Dreadfuls, 
and the infamous case of Jack the Ripper). This leads us to look in depth at the rise of detective fiction, sensation fiction, and the gothic in the long 19th century. From medicine, psychology, criminology to phrenology, mesmerism, and studies on hysteria, we examine scientific and pseudo-scientific discourses that framed and questioned the nature of crime, morality, policing, and the boundaries of good and evil. We consider how Edgar Allan Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle pioneered the detective genre, but also how crime appeared, not just as theft or murder, but as (proto-)crimes against humanity (
The Island of Doctor Moreau 
and the question of vivisection) or the denunciations of the crimes of the British empire (Joseph Conrad’s 
Heart of Darkness
). We also examine gothic and sensational reactions to crime alongside the rise of psychoanalysis, spiritualism, and questions of gender and sexuality. Throughout, the course asks students to consider moral, ethical, and cultural questions in Victorian literature: how do literature and science construct notions of good and evil? How are race, gender, class, empire, and sexuality implicated in ideas of crime and criminality? Why were the Victorians and why are we still drawn to stories of transgression and detection?",,,,10653,,W3049-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3049-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3049W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3050,Law and Literature,"In contemporary American culture, legal practice and literary studies share a commitment to careful use of language, rigorous interpretation, and a deep and imaginative engagement with meaning. Scholars and practitioners have been debating for decades how the two practices can reinforce each other, improve each other, critique each other, and refute each other. (As this debate shows, both communities also love to argue.) In this course, we will read and discuss a classic set of literary texts that speak to certain preoccupations within the legal tradition. We will also look at certain debates and controversies within legal discourse to see how the tools and insights of literary and cultural analysis can change our perspective. We won’t be focusing on literary history nor legal doctrine – no previous knowledge of either is required. Instead, we will look at texts where shared concerns – about interpretation, about evidence, about empathy, and about justice and fairness – allow us to use both literary and legal thinking to advance our own understanding of these ongoing debates.",,,,10589,,W3050-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3050-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3050W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3052,The 1990s     A Literary History,"How should we write the literary history of the 1990s—the decade in which history briefly died, the Internet arrived, and everything became “global”? The central gamble of this class is that the 1990s are now far enough away from us in time that a new sort of cultural and historical perspective is becoming possible. What kind of critical judgments can we make about the literature of the 1990s and how confident can we be about our objectivity? Can we identify trends that emerged, or ended, in the period? What body of texts, or group of authors or forms, should we use in writing the literary history of the 1990s – and what criteria should we use for their selection?
  
Our class meetings will feature extended discussion of significant literary works published in Britain and the US during the 1990s. Authors include major poets and novelists from the period: Thom Gunn, Harryette Mullen, Cormac McCarthy, Hanif Kureishi, Toni Morrison, W. G. Sebald, and Anne Carson. Literary discussion will be mixed with readings from criticism (academic and popular), literary theory, and literary sociology.

ENGL UN3053,Reading and Writing Memoir,"This seminar has two central goals: first, to teach you how to write a clear, indeed eloquent essay, a skill that will prove useful throughout your life.  Second, to read some of the greatest (or most interesting) examples of the literary genre of memoir, with the goal of creating at the end of the course a memoir (of some aspect of your life) that responds to the history of the genre (second goal) and is well written (the first).   
  
The seminar will read excerpts from Augustine, Cellini, Montaigne, Rousseau, Casanova, Wollstonecraft, Proust, Jacobs, Arenas, Erneaux, Lous, Knausgaard, Sebald, and Ferrante.   We will analyze the memoirs in terms of the creation, and transformation, of the genre of autobiography, and its relation to the novel form.   And as we shift from one assignment to other, more complex ones, we will emphasize clarity of expression as the beginning of a personal style.",,,,10592,,W3053-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3053-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3053W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3054,Sex and Gender across Long Time,"The idea of gender is a relatively recent formulation, often complicated by the ferocity division between the sexes found across history.  This course uses art objects, literary texts, philosophy, psychology and finally film and digital media to interrogate the ideas of sex and gender, to explore the violent ways in which female sexuality has been denied or constrained, that same-sex desire was erased or pathologized, and how transgenderism, even as it works to deny sexual difference, complicates the relations between both sex and gender.  
  
The goal of this course is to explore the transformations of notions of sex, and more recently gender, across history. We will engage in writing exercises designed to sharpen our interpretive and analytical abilities, and over the six weeks develop a research project of approximately 20 pages. Through our conversations, we hope that we will be able to understand the complex issues surrounding these explosive ideas – ideas that impact us in so many ways – and in so doing gain a powerful, intellectual voice.",,,,10624,,W3054-20262-001,Sex and Gender across Lon,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3054-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3054W001,SEMINAR

ENGL UN3699,Arts Matronage in America,"Yaddo is an artists community located in Saratoga Springs, New York.  In the words of John Cheever, “the forty or so acres on which the studios and principal buildings of Yaddo stand have seen more distinguished activity in the arts that any other piece of ground in the English speaking community.”  Cheever, however, also described Yaddo’s menagerie of creatives as a group of, “lushes down on their luck, men and women at the top of their powers, nervous breakdowns, thieves, geniuses, cranky noblemen, and poets who ate their peas with a knife.”  In total this makes for spectacular drama.  
  
Historically speaking Yaddo is an idealized synergy of Gilded Age gender roles and is best understood as ½ Thomas Edison’s Menlo Park (“the Menlo Park factory was a loud, rowdy, and raucous place full of nightly sing-alongs around a large organ, gaming, practical jokes, and midnight feasts”) and one half Settlement House (a space where American women, “expropriated the previously male world of literature and the arts as their own, feeling they possessed a special humanistic sensitivity which provided an alternative to the acquisitive and the competitive goals of men in an industrializing America.”).   
  
Yaddo’s guest list is a “whose who” of American Art and letters.  We will, however,  study Yaddo as a compelling introduction to the shifts, evolutions, and challenges to American art across the 20th century; including: the study of politically radical art during the 1930s and a remarkable study of Cold War era political threats to American creativity with a special focus on the Lavender Scare. 
  
Because The Yaddo Records (Yaddo’s archive) are at NYPL, and because I served as project archivist for these records we will also spend a day at NYPL that will include introduction to Yaddo’s archive specifically but also to archives more generally.  Finally, we will be visited (either in person or online) from a variety of Yaddo alum who will share their experiences and impressions and answer student questions etc.",,,,10598,,W3699-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3699-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3699W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3804,British Women Writers: the Woman Questio,"This course will examine British women writers including Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and Virginia Woolf in the context of the (long-) nineteenth-century ""Woman Question"". Our inquiry will engage the controversy over a woman’s status in terms of the social and political debates of early feminism as well as the enigma of “woman’s nature” in light of the rise of psychology and psychoanalysis in the period. We will consider how women writers negotiate these current social and psychological discourses in the stories they tell about themselves and others: how do they portray a woman’s life, especially as it manifests the tension George Eliot articulates between “inward impulse and outward fact”? We will pay attention to representations of gender, subjectivity, interiority, desire, domestic affections, friendship, education, economic and professional experience, faith, and creativity as reflecting the struggle, rising influence, and emergent identity of woman. In addition to novels, poetry, and drama, we will read excerpts of critical essays from among our primary authors and other prominent thinkers of the period, such as Wollstonecraft, Martineau, Taylor Mill, and Freud, who, by the early twentieth century, still famously puzzles: “What does a woman want?”",,,,10488,,W3804-20262-001,British Women Writers,Summer Session (SUMM),ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3804-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262ENGL3804W001,SEMINAR

FILM GU4039,TV Writing Revision,"COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
This class will teach revising an original pilot script. We will review the basics of writing scripts for TV with an emphasis on character, structure, and an eye towards the current marketplace. We will also prepare for a professional career in the writers room, pitching original pilots, and work towards revising this sample for staffing as well as selling.
  
REQUIREMENTS:
 Students will revise one original pilot script during the class, with at least 3 full revisions of script and completion of a 6 page pitch document totaling no more than 10-12 minutes of pitch time.
  
NOTE:
 Students who did not enroll in S4030 TV Writing in Summer Session A may enroll in TV Writing: Revision if they have a completed pilot. Applications will be reviewed and students will be notified of their acceptance.
  
CLASS DESIGN:
 This class will parallel the professional TV development and revision process as closely as possible, as well as mimic the atmosphere of a writers room revising an episode’s script after first draft to give students the feeling of both these situations.
  
Students will receive detailed notes and pitches from the room to revise their sample. They will also write up their series as a pitch document and pitch the show to the class. The goal is for each student to finish 
at least
 a third draft of the pilot by the end of the semester.
  
THE RULES: 
Everyone participates. This is a workshop class so both your work and your feedback are vital to your classmates. You will not pass this class without being an ACTIVE participant.
  
WORK
 is due 48 hours prior to class, As this is a revision class, the reading load will vary week to week, but it could require reading full revisions each week. Your fellow students will need time to give thorough notes and feedback.

FILM S3023,VIDEO GAMES AND FILM,"Cinema and videogames are moving-image-based media, and, especially over the past two decades, they have been credited with influencing each other. But how deep do their similarities actually go? In what way do the possibilities available to game developers differ from those available to filmmakers? How does each medium segment and present space, time, and action? What aesthetic effects are open to games that are not open to cinema, and vice versa? This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic relationship between cinema and video games. Through a combination of film screenings, gameplay, theoretical reading/discussions, and practical assignments, students will examine the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and narrative connections between these two influential media forms. The course aims to foster an understanding of how cinema and video games intersect, inform, and influence one another, providing a unique perspective on storytelling techniques within these mediums. The course will culminate in a final presentation where students will adapt an existing intellectual property, preferably a film or TV show, into a video game (or vice versa), justifying their creative choices.",,,,10303,,S3023-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3023-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262FILM3023S001,SEMINAR

They circulate as market commodities, forms of entertainment, and vehicles for social change. In this class we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary, including projects created within the media industries of China, Cambodia, Chechnya, Ukraine, Nigeria, and India. We will also examine the presence of “the global” within the United States, which involves exploring questions of immigration, border-crossing, and transnational co-production. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (AI, virtual and augmented reality), star-studded film festivals, and the reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda. Guest speakers (scholars, filmmakers, programmers) working in the field will enrich our class discussions.

FILM UN3025,Narrative Design for Games and Interacti,"Traditionally, stories have followed a linear path, with a clear distinction between teller and audience. Yet, since the late 20th century, this model is shifting. Today, postmodern fiction, video games, interactive films, VR, participatory theater and immersive experiences offer audiences agency, creating a challenge for creators: how do they uphold narrative integrity while allowing for choice, collaboration, and remixing?
  
In this class, we’ll examine how modern narrative designers craft stories across media that invite audience participation. Through history, analysis, and workshops, we’ll explore how creators design for interaction while preserving tone and themes, turning audiences into active participants.
  
For the final assignment, students will develop a 12-15 minute pitch presentation for an original story concept, adapting it into an interactive format that balances strong authorial vision with audience agency.",,,,10304,,S3025-20262-001,Narr Design for Games & I,Summer Session (SUMM),FILM,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/S3025-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262FILM3025S001,SEMINAR

HIST GU4112,The European Enlightenment,"This course aims to introduce students to classic and more recent literature on the intellectual and cultural history of the Enlightenment. The field has expanded far beyond the cohort of free-thinking 
philosophes
 around which it was initially conceived to encompass broader cultural, economic, and religious preoccupations. Given these tendencies, how has the significance of the Enlightenment shifted as a historical period and interpretive framework? In what ways do scholars explicate its origins, outcomes, and legacies? The readings trace the development of Enlightenment thought and practices from their early manifestations in Britain and the United Provinces before shifting attention to France, the geographical focal point of the movement by mid-century. Topics to be addressed include the relationship of traditional political authorities to an emerging public sphere, the invention of society as a means of mediating human relationships, the entrepreneurial and epistemological innovations made possible by new media, the struggles of the 
philosophe
 movement for legitimacy, debates surrounding luxury consumption and commercial society, the rise of political economy as field of knowledge and practical platform, and arguments between Christian apologists and radical atheists over the status of religious truth.",Charly J Coleman,1:00pm,4:10pm,10556,,W4112-20262-001,The European Enlightenmen,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W4112-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20262HIST4112W001,SEMINAR

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions. The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,9:00am,1:00pm,10497,,S3116-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S3116-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20262HIST3116S001,SEMINAR

HIST S3596,HIST OF LATINOS/AS IN THE U.S.,"As a population, Latino, Latina, Latine, and Latinx peoples have been prominent in the public sphere in popular culture, the media, and especially around discussions of immigration. Though individuals with a tapestry of Spanish-Indian-African ancestry (who may be described as “Latinas/os” “Hispanics” or “Latinxs” today) explored the lands of present-day Florida and New Mexico long before English colonizers reached Plymouth Rock, Latina/o/x communities are continually seen as foreigners, immigrants, and “newcomers” to American society. This course aims to place Latina/o populations in the United States within historical context. We begin by asking:  Who are Latinas/os in the U.S. and how did they become part of the American nation-state?  Why are they identified as a distinct group? How have they participated in American society and how have they been perceived over time?  The course will familiarize students with the broad themes, periods, and questions raised in the field of Latinx History.  Topics include conquest and colonization, immigration, labor recruitment, education, politics, popular culture, and social movements.  The course emphasizes a comparative approach to Latinx history aiming to engage histories from the Southwest, Midwest, and Eastern United States and across national origin groups—Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This class is taught in mostly the modern period (after 1750) within United States history so it can count toward the history major or concentration. Where the course points may be applied depends on a student’s field of specialization within their major or concentration. The course can also count toward the 
Global Core
 requirement, which is reflected on the Columbia online registry.  The class can, moreover, serve as three elective points toward degree progress or as non-technical elective credits. Finally, the course is regularly

HIST S4981,REVOL/RAD POLITICS-MARX-MAY'68,"This seminar will expose students to classical texts in political theory relating to revolutionary action, political ethics and social militancy from the Communist Manifesto to 1968. The course will explore the idea of revolutionary ethics as conceived by Western and non-Western political philosophers and militants. The discussion will stress the connection between philosophers and revolutionary leaders and the transformation of the idea of radical politics through the dialogue between these two discourses (the philosophical and the militant) and the public reception of revolutionary events in the media and commemorative writings. Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties. Students will be exposed to different discourses of political militancy and radical politics and to reflect on the ethical implications of the history of radical thought and action in comparative perspective.",Alheli Alvarado-Diaz,1:00pm,5:00pm,10509,,S4981-20262-001,REVOL/RAD POLITICS-MARX-M,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/S4981-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20262HIST4981S001,SEMINAR
HIST UN2072,DAILY LIFE IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE,"This course is designed as travellers guide to medieval Europe. Its purpose is to provide a window to a long-lost world that provided the foundation of modern institutions and that continues to inspire the modern collective artistic and literary imagination with its own particularities. This course will not be a conventional history course concentrating on the grand narratives in the economic, social and political domains but rather intend to explore the day-to-day lives of the inhabitants, and attempts to have a glimpse of their mindset, their emotional spectrum, their convictions, prejudices, fears and hopes. It will be at once a historical, sociological and anthropological study of one of the most inspiring ages of European civilization.

The lectures will be accompanied by maps, images of illuminated manuscripts and of medieval objects. Students will be required to attend a weekly discussion section to discuss the medieval texts bearing on that weeks subject.

HIST UN3729,Colonization/Decolonization,"This course examines the processes of colonization and decolonization that define the making of a modern, integrated world (c. 1500 to the present). We will study primary source materials.  We focus on the instruments of colonization—the treaty, the charter, the map, the ethnology—and the engines of decolonization—the manifesto, the resistance, the solidarity with the colonial, the demand for self rule. We are interested in the processes and contents of social and cultural contact and exchange, the development of knowledge, and how they shape relations of power; the place of colonialism in the development of western capitalism; and the elements of colonial power and resistance, including ideologies of liberal political philosophy, social Darwinism, and nationalism.  We will consider how ideas about race, civilization, religion, self and other, and freedom have evolved over time and shaped the making of the modern world.",Manan Ahmed,9:00am,12:10pm,10626,,W3729-20262-001,Colonization/Decolonizati,Summer Session (SUMM),HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W3729-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262HIST3729W001,SEMINAR
HIST UN3779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current ‘memory wars’ in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.

INTL S6540,The U.N. and World Politics,"The purpose of this six-week course is to provide a greater understanding of the complex role the United Nations plays in world politics and the maintenance of peace and security through multilateral decision making. In this uncertain political climate, it is even more important to understand global institutions, their strengths and weaknesses and how they function. The United Nations with its 193 member states provides a mirror onto the world and if that world is fractured, the UN body will reflect those fissures.",Jean Krasno,2:00pm,5:10pm,10391,,S6540-20262-001,The U.N. and World Politi,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6540-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262INTL6540S001,LECTURE

INTL S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,9:00am,12:10pm,10393,,S6559-20262-001,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6559-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262INTL6559S001,SEMINAR

It explores the emerging role of non-state actors, in particular the private sector and civil society. The last sessions will examine in detail the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 and the recognition that to be relevant in today's rapidly changing world, the UN must commit itself to major reform.

We pay particular attention to the recurring tensions that run through American foreign policy: isolationism v. internationalism, security v. prosperity, diplomacy v. military power, unilateralism v. multilateralism, and realism v. idealism.

INTL S6797,SPECIAL OPERATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY,"Special Operations are typically defined as national security actions in hostile, denied, or sensitive environments, and often require covert, clandestine, or low-visibility approaches. From hostage-rescue operations to tactical reconnaissance, special operations forces are typically deployed for national security objectives in which traditional military units are not suitable or applicable. This course examines the nexus of special operations and national security, with the United States serving as its primary example. It has four core objectives: 1) develop an understanding of the concepts and ideas of special operations in national security; 2) explore the priorities and challenges of the utility of special operations, from intelligence to policies to investments; 3) exchange insights, paradigms, and perspectives in class discussions and assignments; and 4) sharpen analytical thinking, research methods, writing skills, and verbal communication. Major themes of study will be: national security fundamentals; concepts of war, conflict, and special operations; and the use of special operations forces over time.",David Gutschmit,9:00am,12:10pm,10397,,S6797-20262-001,SPECIAL OPS & NATL SECURI,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6797-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262INTL6797S001,LECTURE

Through a comparison with the West, students will inquire whether a unique approach is required when considering appropriate responses to security issues in East Asia.",Fumiko Sasaki,2:00pm,5:10pm,10399,,S6801-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),INTL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/INTL/S6801-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262INTL6801S001,LECTURE

JOUR S3016,INTRO TO VIDEO STORYTELLING,"The Introduction to Video Storytelling course teaches students the basics of conceiving, researching, and reporting a story through video. Students will learn to think critically about what makes for a good video story--what makes it newsworthy, what makes video the proper medium for conveying that story--and how to execute using the latest technology. Students will learn how to use and handle a camera, how to best record sound, how to properly frame and light a subject or scene, as well as learn how to use Adobe Premiere editing software.

JOUR S3019,WAR REPORTING:THE COVERAGE OF,"War Reporting: The Coverage of Armed Conflict explores the origins and roles of modern war reporting, examines the challenges journalists face, and discusses journalism's place in the public discourse of armed conflict and political violence, most notably terrorism. Taught by U.S. Marine corps veteran and Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and author, C.J. Chivers, class discussions will be lively and require student engagement. There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war. The examination of risks to journalists on conflict beats will include detailed case studies of real kidnappings and battlefield deaths, and study examples of risk mitigation and best practices in the field. The course is intended for students with a deep interest in war, terrorism and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners. It aims to promote skepticism of official narratives and critical thinking about journalism itself.",Christopher J Chivers,9:00am,12:10pm,10266,,S3019-20262-001,WAR REPORTING:THE COVERAG,Summer Session (SUMM),JOUR,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/JOUR/S3019-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262JOUR3019S001,LECTURE

MATH UN2015,Linear Algebra and Probability,"Linear algebra with a focus on probability and statistics. The course covers the standard linear algebra topics: systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, vector spaces, bases, dimension, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions. It also teaches applications of linear algebra to probability, statistics and dynamical systems giving a background sufficient for higher level courses in probability and statistics. The topics covered in the probability theory part include conditional probability, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions and the limit theorems, as well as Markov chains, curve fitting, regression, and pattern analysis. The course contains applications to life sciences, chemistry, and environmental life sciences. No a priori background in the life sciences is assumed.
  
This course is best suited for students who wish to focus on applications and practical approaches to problem solving. It is recommended to students majoring in engineering, technology, life sciences, social sciences, and economics.

MDES UN1001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"The purpose of this foundational course is to introduce Columbia undergraduate students, in the context of their Global Core curriculum, to the seminal field of critical theory. The historical domain of this course is within the last century and its geographical spectrum is global. European critical thinkers are included in this course but not privileged. Thinkers from Asia, Africa, Europe, North, South, and Latin America, are examined here in chronological order and in equal democratic footing with each other. This course as a result is decidedly cross-cultural, one step forward towards de-alienating critical thinkers from around the globe and the issues they address without pigeonholing them as something “other” or “different.” The course is designed and offered in the true spirit of the “Global Core.” The purpose of the course is to reach for the common denominator of serious critical thinking about the fate of our humanity and the health of our social relations in an increasingly fragile world—where the false binaries of “the West” and “the Rest” no longer hold. The roster of critical thinkers we will examine is by no means exhaustive but representative. Any number of other critical thinkers can be added to this roster but none of those we will examine can be excluded from them. The course is divided into thirteen successive weeks and for each week a number of seminal, original, and groundbreaking texts are identified. Each week we will examine selected passages from these texts. The course is designed as a lecture course, and my lectures are based on the totality of these texts but students will be assigned specific shorter passages to read.",Hamid Dabashi,9:00am,12:10pm,10414,,W1001-20262-001,CRITICAL THEORY: A GLOBAL,Summer Session (SUMM),MDES,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W1001-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20262MDES1001W001,LECTURE

MUSI GU4630,RECORDED SOUND,"As music moves into the 21st century, we find ourselves surrounded by an ever-evolving landscape of technological capability. The world of music, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that change comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility. What does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer? With big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer artists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and distribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and production work on their own. But where does one go to learn how to do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production, but the historical underpinnings and the development of the music production industry as well? How does one develop a comprehensive framework within which they can place their own artistic efforts? How does one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like and develop their own style? This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be the answer. It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music from across history and genres in order to identify the production techniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern technology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical works.",David Adamcyk,9:00am,12:10pm,10675,,W4630-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),MUSI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MUSI/W4630-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262MUSI4630W001,STUDIO

Coupling specifics of rhythm, melody, and harmony with story telling, lyric writing and the voice itself, students will be encouraged to share their imagination in song regardless of style, genre, or aesthetic. Music ranging from Chant to Music Theatre, the German lied to international pop fusion will be included as models upon which to base discussion and creative endeavor. Improvisation and musicianship techniques will complement pedagogical presentations of tonal and non - tonal compositional practice. A required final project based on any combination of composition, analysis, and performance, and in any media will be due at the end of the semester.

POLS S3290,VOTING AND AMERICAN POLITICS,"This course explores causes and effects of political behavior in the United States. “Political behavior” is a broad concept, and can include many areas of engagement with civic life. As we consider “behavior,” we must also take on its foundations: Public opinion, ideology, and partisanship. We will focus primarily on mass politics—beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of ordinary citizens rather than of activists or elites—in the United States. However, we will also explore some effects of elite behavior on mass behavior. We will also focus on the interconnections between social structure, culture, and politics. In short, this course will focus on developing an understanding of the mechanisms that drive voting and other political behaviors in the United States.",Yamil R Velez,,,10504,,S3290-20262-001,VOTING AND AMERICAN POLIT,Summer Session (SUMM),POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/S3290-20262-001/,,In-Person,,3,,,20262POLS3290S001,LECTURE

We will explore these questions and others by focusing on topics such as international trade, foreign aid, investment, and the environment. For each topic, we will use a variety of theoretical lenses and then investigate the evidence in favor of each. More generally, the course will consider the challenges of drawing casual inferences in the field of international political economy. There are no prerequisites for this course but an introductory economy course would be helpful.

The topics we will study include what courts do; how different legal systems function; the operation of legal norms; the U.S. judicial system; the power of courts; constraints on judicial power; judicial review; the origin of judicial institutions; how and why Supreme Court justices make the decisions they do; case selection; conflict between the Court and the other branches of government; decision making and conflict within the judicial hierarchy; the place of courts in American political history; and judicial appointments.
  
We will explore some common but not necessarily true claims about how judges make decisions and the role of courts.  One set of myths sees judges as unbiased appliers of neutral law, finding law and never making it, with ideology, biography, and politics left at the courthouse door. Another set of myths sees the judiciary as the “least dangerous branch,” making law, not policy, without real power or influence.

PSYC S3472,Psychedelic Neuroscience: From Molecules,"Psychedelics are receiving growing attention in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience for their therapeutic potential. Psychedelic compounds like psilocybin, LSD, and DMT produce a wide range of changes to perception, ranging from visual perception to alterations in one’s sense of self. When combined with psychological support or psychotherapy, psychedelics have been shown to lead to rapid and long-lasting therapeutic benefits for a wide range of mental health disorders, including major depression and alcohol use disorder. The acute alterations in perception and long-lasting clinical effects offer exciting insight into the relationship between the mind and the brain. This course will focus on the current state of research on the psychological and neurobiological effects of psychedelics. We will begin with a crash-course into the basics of neuroscience and research methodology. Next, the course will delve into how psychedelics alter brain functioning, both acutely during the drug effects as well as long after they have worn off. Studies covered will span molecular, cellular, and systems level analysis. A core element of the course will include reviewing methodological approaches and neuroscientific evidence for psychedelics interventions in the treatment of clinical/psychiatric disorders. We will also review the clinical data and link neurobiological findings to their practical application to move the field of psychedelic science forward. Throughout the course, there will be a specific focus on critical appraisal of research, identifying strengths and limitations surrounding current research, and important avenues for future research. Students should leave the class with an enhanced ability to evaluate research findings and a broad understanding of the mechanisms of action of psychedelics.
  
The format of the course will include lectures, class discussions and presentations, and guest speakers.

PSYC S4655,"The science of me, you and us:  insights","Why do we feel the way we do, how do we understand ourselves and others, and how does this relate to our social relationships?  Why does all of this sometimes leave us feeling anxious, depressed, lonely and isolated?  And when that happens, what we can do about it?  In this seminar, we will tackle these questions using an integrative approach that blends social psychology, clinical psychology and neuroscience to uncover how our emotions and social interactions sometimes work well and sometimes falter.  To do this, we will examine human behavior at multiple levels, connecting our social and emotional lives (what we experience and how we act) to cognitive processes (how our minds process information) and underlying neural mechanisms (what's happening in the brain).  As the semester unfolds, we start by building an understanding of where our emotions come from, how we can manage them, how we make sense of other people and how we can form positive connections with them.  This knowledge provides a foundation for taking the next step - understanding what happens when things go awry and we end up with momentary - or long-lasting - bouts of anxiety, depression, loneliness and other clinical conditions.  We end by considering what may be everyone’s life goal - the pursuit of happiness - and how everything we have learned can foster that pursuit through personal actions, social connections and psychotherapeutic support.  The overarching goal is to build a nuanced understanding of how and why we think and feel the way we do – about ourselves and others – that can inform both scientific and personal explorations of what “wellbeing” and “mental health” means.

QMSS GR5075,Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Social Sc,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI – like ChatGPT, MidJourney, and Gemini – are poised to change the world for everyone. It is critical that students understand (and utilize) this new technology at several levels. In this class – through readings and a dozen hands-on activities – students will come to deeply understand AI. Specifically, students will construct (using Python) some of the basic building-blocks of AI, like machine learning (like recommendation systems), natural language processing (like word embeddings) and chatbots. They will test out AI’s capabilities and refine prompts in real-world settings, whether in art, video, writing or Internet-of-Things. They will learn about how generative AI fits into the history of technology adoption and the diffusion of innovation, answering questions like: Will AI be able to replace whole jobs? And if so, when? They will use the lenses of psychology and economics to explore the impact of AI in people’s lives, including in the context of algorithmic fairness, regulation and intellectual property. They will be pushed to take human creativity in new directions, augmented by AI’s “weirdness.” Lastly, students will be pushed to further develop their own uniquely-human skills – like in critical thinking and empathy – in response to the power of generative AI to mimic humans. As best-selling author Seth Stephen-Davidowitz has recently (Dec. 2023) written, “So far, my newest book has higher ratings than either of my previous two books -- even though it was written in 1/36th of the time, thanks to AI. AI is wild!"" By the end of this class, students will feel empowered technically and philosophically to handle all new generative AI developments.

WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer? What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,5:30pm,8:40pm,10379,,S4320-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4320-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262WRIT4320S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"The Young Adult (YA) publishing boom has changed the way we read—and write—coming-of-age stories. This course will introduce students to the elements that shape YA novels, and explore the fiction writing techniques needed for long projects, including narrative arcs, character construction, worldbuilding, and scene work. We’ll study work from a wide range of YA genres and authors, including Angie Thomas, Elana K. Arnold, Leigh Bardugo, Jason Reynolds, A.S. King, Elizabeth Acevedo, and more.
  
Students will begin to write and outline their own YA novel, and a variety of in-class writing exercises will support the development of each project. All students will workshop their own writing and respond to the work of others. By the end of class, students will have a portfolio of materials to draw from, and a richer understanding of the YA landscape and its possibilities.",Emily K Austin,10:00am,1:10pm,10380,,S4323-20262-001,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT N,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4323-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262WRIT4323S001,SEMINAR
WRIT S4324,MISFITS AND MISANTHROPES,"People like to be liked. And writers obsess about likability in fiction. But is it that important? What about visionaries, iconoclasts, stragglers, strangers, weirdos, and cringe-inducers? What happens when there is friction between a person and their surroundings? Between people? What if a character throws aside motivations to be liked and impulses to comply?
  
At its heart, this is a class focused on analyzing and crafting characters. We’ll look at loners and lonely hearts, articulate big mouths, and introverted self-imploders. We’ll observe their circumstances and question how their desires encourage them to think and act. Students will regularly respond to prompts and workshop their own writing.
  
Our discussions will consider what choices writers make to render, shape, define, and refine characters. We’ll take on craft-oriented concerns such as: How is dialogue used to differentiate characters? How does a writer demonstrate a character’s compassion, even if their attitude stinks? How do the story's events affect the reader’s understanding of character? What elements in the narrative change—or don’t—over time to signal to the reader that a character is developing?
  
Throughout, students will investigate how emerging writers move from maintaining characters’ status quo and progress to allowing characters to do the unexpected. With every question, we will advance our comprehension of building dynamic representations of people in the world, how they act out, and what it takes to fit in.

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Patricia A Marx,1:30pm,4:40pm,10382,,S4810-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/S4810-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20262WRIT4810S001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Thomas A Donovan,1:30pm,4:40pm,10377,,W3215-20262-001,,Summer Session (SUMM),WRIT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20262-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20262WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR
