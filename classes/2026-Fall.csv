AFEN BC3516,WATER WORLDS IN LITERARY IMAGINATION,"This interdisciplinary course surveys literary, cinematic, historical and other archival text representations of time and change in and around waterways in the Global South—oceanic, riverine, at the littoral and in hinterlands. It is animated by questions of how people live with water as horizon, resource, life-giving source, as ancestral boundaries and threat. We do so now in a time when climate change refocuses our dependencies upon, and vulnerabilities to, water.
  
Our themes are shaped by water’s influence on the rhythms of lives, and how these rhythms have been changed and are changing—deliberately, as in dam building and its aftermaths in lives, and through climate change.",Yvette Christianse,12:10pm,2:00pm,00123,,X3516-20263-001,WATER WORLDS LITERARY,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFEN,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFEN/X3516-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20263AFEN3516X001,SEMINAR

Superfine 
presents a cultural and historical examination of Black dandyism, from Enlightenment England to contemporary incarnations in the cosmopolitan art and fashion worlds of Paris, London, and New York.
  
 
  
Historical manifestations of dandyism range from absolute precision in dress and tailoring to flamboyance and fabulousness in self-presentation. The 
Superfine
 exhibition uses dandyism to chronicle the ways in which Black people have used dress and fashion to transform the identities they were given and to propose new ways of embodying political and social possibilities.

AFRS BC3160,Fanon   s Psychology of the Oppressed,"Frantz Fanon’s ideas have been influential for decades among theorists, practitioners, and activists alike.  This seminar is focused on understanding Fanon’s particular perspective on the psychology of the oppressed and its relevance for examining the experience of past and present racialized inequality and its effects in society. The course is divided into four sections, which build cumulatively.
  
I). An introductory section introduces Fanon’s central ideas (e.g., dialecticism, existentialism, post-colonialism) in their intellectual and socio-historical context (e.g., the Algerian revolution, African decolonization, South African Apartheid, the US civil rights and women’s rights movements).
  
II). A second section locates Fanon in psychological theory and therapeutic theory and practice.  The cultural and political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice are examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological and physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological disorder.
  
III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological approaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed “inferiority complex” of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other reconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological psychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois’s influential ideas regarding double consciousness.
  
IV). A fourth and final section focuses on resistance and rebellion.  The focus here is on the psycho-moral implications of (violent, peaceful, non-disruptive) action against oppression with reference to the distinct perspectives of Fanon in comparison to influential figures like Gandhi and M.L.K Jr.  These issues are linked to a post-Fanon approach to the psychology of the oppressed called Liberation Psychology.",Colin Leach,2:10pm,4:00pm,00131,,X3160-20263-001,Psychology of the Oppress,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFRS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFRS/X3160-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20263AFRS3160X001,SEMINAR

Each week of the course will be devoted to grappling with a set of travelers and international departures characteristic of a given era, including:
  
  
Enslaved people’s quests for freedom

Though often described as a thing of the past, contemporary life is suffused with fears over declining birth rates and dreams of producing perfect “designer babies.”
  
In this class we will explore the long history of attempts to remake reproduction and regulate population across U.S. History (with some excursions into India and Germany), through a study of a range of interdisciplinary scholarship. Together, we will ask: why have panics around population emerged under specific circumstances, and who pushed them? How and why did eugenics explode into popularity at the turn of the century, and how was it adopted into and by various social movements? What, exactly, is (and was) eugenics? What is the relationship between it and earlier efforts to scientifically categorize and remake society? What role did it play in the development of twentieth-century politics? Why did states engage in campaigns of mass sterilization across the first half of the twentieth century? Why did they stop?

 explorations of trans* history and social movements in the United States, Turkey, India, and Pakistan
 (and to a lesser extent Argentina), this course will provide a space to both understand the global
 anti-gender and anti-trans panic and to relate ourselves to the strategies that trans people have used
 to both survive and the demands that they have made for structural change and liberation. The goal
 of this course will be to provide a space of critical study and a site of learning to be in community as
 well as to equip you with both the knowledge and capacity to understand and intervene in
 contemporary trans panics wherever you encounter them. Assignments will be a combination of
 collaborative skill-building, self-reflections, and analyses of the tactics and strategies employed by

ANTH BC2012,LAB METHODS ARCHAEOLOGY,"Only the most recent chapters of the past are able to be studied using traditional historiographical methods focused on archives of textual documents. How, then, are we to analyze the deep history of human experiences prior to the written word? And even when textual archives do survive from a given historical period, these archives are typically biased toward the perspectives of those in power. How, then, are we to undertake analyses of the past that take into account the lives and experiences of all of society’s members, including the poor, the working class, the colonized, and others whose voices appear far less frequently in historical documents? From its disciplinary origins in nineteenth century antiquarianism, archaeology has grown to become a rigorous science of the past, dedicated to the exploration of long-term and inclusive social histories.
  
“Laboratory Methods in Archaeology” is an intensive introduction to the analysis of archaeological artifacts and samples in which we explore how the organic and inorganic remains from archaeological sites can be used to build rigorous claims about the human past. The 2022 iteration of the course centers on assemblages from two sites, both excavated by Barnard’s archaeological field program in the Taos region of northern New Mexico: (1) the Spanish colonial site of San Antonio del Embudo founded in 1725 and (2) the hippie commune known as New Buffalo, founded in 1967. Participants in ANTH BC2012 will be introduced to the history, geology, and ecology of the Taos region, as well as to the excavation histories of the two sites. Specialized laboratory modules focus on the analysis of chipped stone artifacts ceramics, animal bone, glass, and industrial artifacts.
  
The course only demands participation in the seminars and laboratory modules and successful completion of the written assignments, but all students are encouraged to develop specialized research projects to be subsequently expanded into either (1) a senior thesis project or (2) a conference presentation at the Society for American Archaeology, Society for Historical Archaeology, or Theoretical Archaeology Group meeting.",Severin Fowles,4:10pm,6:00pm,00787,,X2012-20263-001,,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X2012-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,ANTH BC2012,TR,20263ANTH2012X001,LECTURE
ANTH BC3243,"Sin, Disease, Subversion and the Experie","Course Description This course provides an exploration of how race and racism are produced, reproduced, and resisted from a Latin American perspective. We will examine a conception of race that is often ambiguous, hybrid, and fluid, yet coexists with deeply entrenched forms of racism. We begin by tracing the origins of racial formations to the colonial period, focusing on how race and religion became intertwined. The course then investigates Latin America's role in the medicalization of racialized bodies, particularly in the context of nation-building projects. We will analyze how racism has operated during periods of political violence, authoritarian rule, and transitions to democracy. Given the region's vast heterogeneity, we will critically examine ""Latin America"" as a category and use representative case studies to explore how race is mediated through signifiers such as education, gender, geography, occupation, dress, language, and religion—while ultimately being inscribed on and through the body. Students will explore Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies, and reflect on how the legacies of colonial and state violence persist but are contested. The first half of this course provides an overview of historical events and theoretical debates around the study of race in Latin America. The second half is dedicated to reading ethnographic work on questions of race. The selected books present cases in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and of immigrants in the United States.",Paloma Rodrigo Gonzales,,,00838,,X3243-20263-001,Race in Latin America,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X3243-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ANTH3243X001,SEMINAR

Modern American culture is so saturated with punishment that it is difficult to know where to begin such an investigation. From childhood education to mass incarceration and from the crafting of financial futures to the training of horses and dogs, punishment is ubiquitous and often unquestioned.

ANTH BC3868,ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELD RESEARCH IN NYC,"This course provides the aspiring anthropologist with an array of primarily qualitative methodological tools essential to successful urban fieldwork. As such, it is a practicum of sorts, where regular field assignments help build one’s ability to record and analyze social behavior by drawing on several key data collection techniques. Because we have the luxury of inhabiting a large, densely populated, international city, this class requires that you take a head-first plunge into urban anthropology. The NYC area will define the laboratory for individually- designed research projects. Be forewarned, however! Ethnographic engagement involves efforts to detect social patterns, but it is often a self-reflexive exercise, too.

ANTH UN2004,INTRO TO SOC & CULTURAL THEORY,"This course presents students with crucial theories of society, paying particular attention at the outset to classic social theory of the early 20th century. It traces a trajectory of writings essential for an understanding of the social: from Saussure, Durkheim, Mauss, Weber, and Marx, on to the structuralist ethnographic elaboration of Claude Levi-Strauss and the historiographic reflections on modernity of Michel Foucault. We revisit periodically, reflections by Franz Boas, founder of anthropology in the United States (and of Anthropology at Columbia), for a sense of origins, an early anthropological critique of racism and cultural chauvinism, and a prescient denunciation of fascism.  We turn as well, also with ever-renewed interest in these times, to the expansive critical thought of W. E. B. Du Bois.  We conclude with Kathleen Stewart’s

As multiple publics become increasingly aware of the extensive and accelerated rate of current global environmental change, and the presence of anthropogenesis in ever expanding circumstances, we need to critically analyze the categories of thought and action being developed in order to carefully approach this change. Our concern is thus not so much the Anthropocene as an immutable fact, inevitable event, or definitive period of time (significant though these are), but rather for the political, social, and intellectual consequences of this important idea. Thus we seek to understand the creativity of The Anthropocene as a political, rhetorical, and social category. We also aim to examine the networks of capital and power that have given rise to the current state of planetary change, the strategies for ameliorating those changes, and how these are simultaneously implicated in the rhetorical creation of The Anthropocene.",Paige West,10:10am,12:00pm,00790,,V3861-20263-001,ANTHROP OF THE ANTHROPOCE,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3861-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20263ANTH3861V001,SEMINAR

ARCH UN1030,THE CITY: THINKING WITH THE URBAN BUILT,"This experiential learning course provides an introduction to the organization and design of the urban built environment. What kinds of spaces make up the city, how are they formed, and what impact do they have on people’s lives? We will consider these key questions of urban design and the distinct answers that have arisen in different historical and geographical contexts, with reference to a global array of case studies. And we will use the built environment of New York City as our classroom, with weekly field trips to iconic (and iconoclastic) examples of urban form, including sites from all five boroughs that reflect a diversity of cultural milieux. Through this comparative approach, the class will challenge the naïve view that the built environment is neutral or inert, emphasizing instead the inherent politics of urban design and the ongoing transformation and contestation of urban space. To arrive at this understanding, students will learn to think with the city, acquiring tools for understanding, representing, and analyzing the urban built environment.
  
The class is organized morphologically into six modules: image, park, plaza, street, block, and arcade. During each unit, students will also be introduced to a specific technique for analyzing urban form: figure-ground, collage, plan, diagram, map, projection, and section.

ARCH UN3120,"CITY,LANDSCAPE, & ECOLOGY","City, Landscape, Ecology 
is a thematically driven course that centers on issues and polemics related to landscape, land settlement and ecology over the past two centuries. The class looks at changing attitudes to the natural world from the eighteenth century to the present, tracing important historical shifts in the consideration of nature across the ecological sciences, conservation practices, landscape design, and environmental activism, law and policy. Lectures focus on the critical role that artists and architects have played, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental degradation and in developing new means of mitigating anthropogenic ecological change.
  
City, Landscape, Ecology 
is divided into three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of 
landscape
: picturesque garden theory, notions of “wilderness” as epitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern and Postmodern garden practices, and place of landscape in the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose here is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays in the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and technologies of power. Lectures in this part are shaped around a dialectical pair of historical episodes–– for example, the picturesque garden is paired with the enclosure of the commons, and American national parks are discussed in relation to the systematic removal of native peoples.
  
We then turn to 
ecology
 and related issues of climate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look at the rise of ecological thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the environment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of the era. In the session “Capitalism, Race and Population Growth” we examine the history of the “crisis” of scarcity from Thomas Robert Malthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (
The Population Bomb
, 1968) to today and look at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity. 
  
The course concludes with Part III on 
Environmental Repair
. At this important juncture in the course, we will ask what is to be done today. We’ll examine the work of contemporary theorists, architects, landscape architects, policy makers and environmentalists who have channeled some of the lessons",Ralph Ghoche,2:40pm,3:55pm,00295,,V3120-20263-001,,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/V3120-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20263ARCH3120V001,LECTURE

Course overview: 
  
Once a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.",Vincent D Fitzpatrick,1:10pm,4:00pm,00432,,X2500-20263-001,R for Scientists,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/X2500-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,F,20263BIOL2500X001,LECTURE

In addition to becoming familiar with a range of Digital Classics projects and gaining hands-on experience with some of the core tools that make Digital Classics possible in the present day, we will read theoretical scholarship in both Digital Classics and DH more generally, to think about not just what has been and can be done, but also what should (and should not) be done. We also will think about where (and whether!) to define the boundaries of “Classics” and the boundaries of “digital.” There are no prerequisites: it is NOT NECESSARY for students to have a background in coding or the field of Classics (although knowledge of either or both is welcome!).

 Course focus and some content will rotate year to year, calibrated to serve the play or
 plays chosen by the student director. We will read these and other relevant other plays or
 similarly adjacent texts, as well as scholarly literature on topics centered around the body
 in performance, including ancient theaters and stage space, costumes and masks,
 deportment and gestures, proxemics, and so on. We will also explore aspects of ancient
 drama and theatricality that relate to translation and reception, as well as inflections of
 gender and status. Other topics may include the mythic background (e.g., in epic and/or
 lyric), politics of aesthetics in ancient Athens, and gender-genre dynamics.
 Each component will extend over three or four classes and consider the ancient
 plays through readings of primary texts (in translation) and conceptual / contextual
 backgrounds. There will be an additional class hour for those who wish to read the play

This course is organized in three parts: perceptual decision-making, value-based decision-making, and computational psychiatry. In part one, perceptual decision-making, we will focus on computational models that can capture and explain decisions in perception, such as categorizing an orientation, or discriminating the direction of moving dots, or estimating the magnitude of a stimulus (e.g., time). We will start by laying the foundations of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference under uncertainty and build to models that incorporate confidence ratings and reaction times. In part two, value-based decision-making, we will move on to decisions that incorporate our values (e.g., ‘Should I go out or stay in and study?’, ‘Should I eat a burger or a salad?’). We will learn the basics of a computational modeling framework that captures how we learn values from rewards and punishments, reinforcement learning, as well as about model-free and model-based learning. Lastly, we will learn how impairments in decision-making that occur in psychopathology (e.g., addiction, anorexia nervosa, anxiety) have been conceptualized and quantified in the relatively new field of computational psychiatry.",Andra L Mihali,,,00648,,W3951-20263-001,Comp Models of Decision-M,Cognitive Science @Barnard,COGS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COGS/W3951-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263COGS3951W001,SEMINAR

We will consider, cultural, literary and philosophical theories of translation, as well as the role of translation and translators in today's globalized world. Topics covered will include: translation in the context of postcolonialism, globalization and immigration; the translation of children’s literature; subbing and dubbing in film and television, including fansubbing; translation and ecology; translation and justice; machine translation; linguistic rights; debates about mono- versus plurilingualism. We will also consider, less extensively, the place of interpreting (i.e. oral translation primarily in legal and medical settings). Specialists from the New York area will come to speak about current needs and challenges in the field of community interpreting. On the literary level, we will examine the role played by foreign languages (and translation) in the creative process of contemporary writers. We will read a number of “language memoirs,” narratives that recount the authors’ complex and sometimes agonized relation to acquiring a second language (Eva Hoffman, Xiaolu Guo, Alice Kaplan et al). For one of the assignments you will write the beginning of your own language history. We will also read and study in depth Brian Friel’s play 
Translations
. This play is about the replacement of Irish (Gaelic) place names with English names as a result of an ordnance survey in the early 18th century. The course aims to help students improve their translation skills by translating (mostly literature) from your second language (your L2, as the linguists call it) into English, by critically assessing published translations, and by evaluating each other’s' translations-in-progress (including one of the professor's). There will be a number of guest lecturers (translators, editors, writers, interpreters, etc).

CPLT BC3350,IN OTHER WORDS: WORLD POETRY & COSMOPOLI,"What is “world poetry”? This course will try to give an answer to this vexing question. You are being introduced to a number of influential poets who have entered a dialogue about what it means to write, read, translate and appreciate poetry in a global context. The impact of globalization is most visible in a number of anthologies which made considerable efforts to move beyond the existing range of national representatives and to make an English-speaking audience familiar with the names and works of poets who are bilingual or who write in their native language. Throughout the semester, we will read English translations of these poems (but feel free to read the original if you know the language). Secondly, the global context is of great importance for understanding each poet’s vision of the world since poets are involved in processes of “world-making” as well as reacting to the world’s past and present. s the semester progresses you will see that the poets are part of a larger conversation; some themes, forms and issues we discovered at the beginning will return in the middle or toward the end of the term. The selection of poets is based on considerations of gender, race, age and religious affiliation; many of the poets whose works we are going to discuss are iconic figures; in studying other cases, you will be exposed to new voices (for example, young South African poets) whose significance will emerge in a critical discussion of the anthologists’ rationale and criteria for selecting poets and marginalizing others.",Erk Grimm,,,00254,,X3350-20263-001,WORLD POETRY & COSMOPOLIT,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3350-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263CPLT3350X001,LECTURE

DNCE BC3331,NOW. Moving in the Moment: An Introducti,"There are as many reasons to improvise as there are cultures. People from all over the world have turned to improvised dance for personal, social, and political reasons. Improvisation is equally as useful in developing self-expression as it is in forming community and mutual understanding. It can be a vehicle for discovering more about our world by heightening our senses and awareness. It can be a mind-puzzle, as practitioners devise creative constraints for the purposes of producing structure and clarity. Whatever the reason for improvising, all practitioners share a sense of questioning and curiosity. This course will cover five units of study, each one aimed at exploring a different function of improvisation: self- expression; music and space; our bodies and environment; structure and cognition; and community-building. Learning in the classroom will rely on reading texts and viewing images and videos, written work, peer-to-peer learning and self-directed inquiry. In the studio, students will be given different exercises and prompts to explore and refine. By the end of the semester students will understand how improvisation occurs and how it differs from codified or prescriptive work, and why different people choose to improvise. They will also be able to develop and perform their own improvisatory work, drawing from the skills learned over the semester.",Caroline Fermin,1:10pm,2:25pm,00180,,X3331-20263-001,Intro to Dance Improvisat,Dance @Barnard,DNCE,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DNCE/X3331-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20263DNCE3331X001,LECTURE

This course will introduce the exploration of a partnering technique that is enriching for the mind and body. Contact Improvisation is not only an important tool for the dancer as it informs the body how to move with weight and connection and is required by most contemporary styles – it is also a technique that informs the artist in us all as it emphasizes listening, trust, and spontaneous creativity. In this course, students will use contact to support the creation of most duets, trios, and larger group dance.   Focus is placed on recent improvisatory forms, sensation building, center connection, and finding the safe edges of risk as well as applying these studies to creation and expression. Students in this course will explore their own weight and how it relates to other bodies by listening as well as employing emotional, psychological, and cultural structures to their improvisation. Emphasis is placed on listening and sensation rather than controlling or leading. Students will explore the dynamic ride and risk taking of improvisation and trusting another body by giving and taking weight.

We review how Indian classical dance aligns with the oldest of performance texts, and with lively discourses (rasa as a performance aesthetic, Orientalism, nationalism, global recirculations) through the ages, not only in India but also in Europe, Britain and America. Throughout the course, we ask:- How is culture embodied? How do historical texts configure dance today? How might they affect our thinking on mind-body, practice-theory, and traditional-contemporary divides? How does bodily patterning influence the ways that we experience our surroundings and vice versa? Can cultural imaginaries instigate action? How is gender is performed?

EAAS BC3840,Beyond the Great Wall: Nomadic Empires a,"Since Antiquity, the Great Wall has become both a geographical and socio-cultural fault line between steppe nomads and the Chinese. More than a physical and territorial boundary, the Great Wall also functions as a powerful conceptual metaphor, symbolizing the gap between insiders and outsiders. The intellectual discourses of “frontier” and “border” embodied by the Wall have kept alive well into modern China.
 The course follows a broadly chronological order from the Xiongnu Empire through the Mongols to modern times. Additionally, it incorporates thematic explorations such as nomadic culture, Sinitic concepts of unity, ethno-cultural diversity, multi-linguistic empires, and so on. We will make use of Chinese literature and art on the one hand, and primary sources from Central Asia on the other, to develop a comprehensive and comparative understanding of both sides of the Great Wall. As such, we ask how the nomads served as agents of change in Eurasian and even world history, and in turn, we problematize some enduring challenges faced by the Chinese state from the past to the present.
 Listed as a Global Core, this course assumes no background of Chinese or Central Asian language and literature. Students are expected to engage thoughtfully and critically with course materials, including primary sources translated into English and secondary scholarship. Readings will include classical texts from Sinitic culture as well as diverse literary sources on nomadic peoples, such as The Secret History of the Mongols and travelogues by Marco Polo. These primary texts will be examined alongside secondary scholarship, with visual and material objects integrated to complement the written texts.",Lili Xia,2:10pm,4:00pm,00059,,X3840-20263-001,Beyond the Great Wall: No,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,EAAS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/X3840-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20263EAAS3840X001,SEMINAR

EAAS GU4370,Literati Culture in Pre-Modern China,"Premodern Chinese literati have long been regarded as active historical agents who shaped “This Culture of Ours”—a metonym for civilization in the premodern Sinitic context—while they also fed from, partook in, and influenced popular and foreign cultures. Besides “literary writings” like poetry and prose, literati also engaged in calligraphy, painting, and antiquarianism under the umbrella term of “literary or cultural arts.” In turn, the creation and appreciation of artwork were intrinsic to the aesthetic life of literati community and further established their self-identity. At the same time, social exclusivity, (self-)doubt and identity crises, along with the looming threat of cultural decline, have continually haunted this literati community throughout the ages.
  
Covering the long trajectory of imperial China, this course reveals the birth and development of literati culture. In particular, we take an interdisciplinary approach, introducing intellectual and poetic discourses, socio-historical contexts, literary criticism, visual and material culture, to envision a “common ground” for their civil world. Textual, visual sources plus material objects are meant to have conversations with each other in this course. Important issues include historical transformations of the elite class, cultural geography in different eras, materiality and visuality of elite calligraphy and painting, literati self-expression through aesthetic practice, the roles of the court and literati in producing and preserving art, as well as other relevant issues such as gender studies, vernacular literature, and commodity society.
  
This course is cross-listed in AMEC and CPLT. For undergraduates, no background in Chinese language is required in this course, and all reading materials—either translation of primary sources or secondary scholarship—are accessible in English.",Lili Xia,2:10pm,4:00pm,00060,,W4370-20263-001,Literati Cult.

EAAS GU4840,CHINA AND POLITICS OF DESIRE,"A recent American newspaper headline announced that China has become “the most materialistic country the world.” Globally circulating narratives often interpret Chinese consumers’ demand for commodities as an attempt to fill a void left by the absence of the Maoist state, traditional religious life, and Western-style democracy. But things aren’t as simple as they appear. This course explores the intertwined questions of “Chinese” desire and the desire for China. Avoiding reductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural human attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the production and management of desire within a complex global field. Drawing on ethnographies, films, short stories, and psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting figure of desire across the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics, government officials, intellectuals, and artists have represented Chinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders’ attempts to improve the “quality” of the country’s population to citizens’ dreams of home ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and other commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures of recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been conceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters.",Nicholas A Bartlett,10:10am,12:00pm,00064,,W4840-20263-001,CHINA AND POLITICS OF DES,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,EAAS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/W4840-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20263EAAS4840W001,SEMINAR

This course is designed for students who intend to work as educators or in related fields; students interested in studying the dialectical relationship between education and major social, political, and/or historical trends; and students in film and media studies who want to explore the documentary film genre, including analysis, critique and production aspects. 
  
 The course will combine a seminar that centers documentary films about education as core texts for analysis and study with a workshop in film techniques to support the production of novel film projects. Students will learn how to read and critique documentary films selected to represent and foster multiple perspectives through their narratives, evidence, arguments, and technical elements. Additional readings will provide a contemporary context for the films and offer additional perspectives. With that said, the goal is not to be exhaustive of the range of perspectives on each issue, rather, they represent a starting point for class discussion and dialogue, and a launch pad for students to make their own short documentary films.",,,,00659,,X3032-20263-001,CONTEMPORARY ISSUES_EDUCA,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3032-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263EDUC3032X001,SEMINAR

New technologies that facilitate the movement of information, goods and people across borders have made it easier for people to remain culturally, politically, economically and socially connected to the places from which they migrated. This seminar focuses on the experiences of the youngest members of these global migration patterns—children and youth—and asks: What do these global flows mean for educating young people to be members of the multiple communities to which they belong?
  
This seminar will explore the following questions: What is globalization and why is it leading to new patterns of migration? How do children and youth experience ruptures and continuities across contexts of migration? How do language policies affect young people’s capacity to be educated in a new land? What does it mean to forge a sense of belonging and citizenship in a “globalized” world, and how does this challenge our models of national citizenship? How are the processes by which young people are incorporated into their new country entwined with structures of race, class, and gender?

EDUC BC3048,MARKETIZATION & PRIVATIZATION IN EDUCATI,"It has become commonplace for governments to partner with the private sector to deliver public goods and services; this is seen as a way to increase efficiency and decrease costs. Often, this privatization goes hand in hand with an adoption of market values. Nowhere are these trends more evident – or important – than public education. Arguments for educational privatization are often thought of in terms of economics – does it save money? – or limited measures of student achievement - does it raise test scores? In this course, we acknowledge these questions, but we also go beyond them to explore the political and social dimensions of privatization. We ask: Who wins and who loses when public schools privatize? What happens when market values are normalized and prioritized in our schools?
  
The following questions frame our explorations:
  
·How does privatization in education differ from privatization in other sectors? 
  
·What are the implications of educational privatization and marketization for democracy and the public good?
  
·Who profits from privatization and how does this support or interfere with educative goals?
  
·How are philanthropy, venture capital, and corporate partnerships reshaping the way schools serve students?
  
·Does privatization expand opportunities for marginalized students, deepen existing inequalities, or both?
  
·How does privatization affect the teacher workforce? How does it affect the nature of teachers’ work and student learning?
  
·How is privatization proceeding globally? How is privatization linked with global policy spread?
  
·What forms do resistance to privatization take? What ethical considerations should we take up around privatization?

EDUC BC3051,SEMINAR URBAN EDUCATION,"This seminar serves as the capstone course for students pursuing the Education Studies minor/special concentration or the Urban Studies major/concentration with an Urban Education Specialization. The Seminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-cultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time, a range of social actors have intervened in the “problem” of urban education, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools. Others have disputed this “problem” focused approach, arguing that policy makers, teachers, and researchers should start from the strengths and capacities located in urban communities. Despite decades of wide ranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide their students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban Education investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course questions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity in urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of assets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this history and context, what would effective reform in a global city like NYC look like? Students will engage these questions not only through course readings and seminar discussions, but through a 40-hour field placement in a New York City public school classroom, extra-curricular program, or other education based site.",Fawziah Qadir,,,00753,,X3051-20263-001,SEMINAR IN URBAN EDUCATION,Education @Barnard,EDUC,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3051-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263EDUC3051X001,SEMINAR

Issues covered are climate change, invasive species, water resources, sustainability, etc. A major goal is for students to understand the science behind environmental issues. Readings from the scientific literature, various newspaper articles, magazines and an online textbook are carefully coordinated with the topics. Because of our location, the lab curriculum features studies of the Hudson River and its forested shorelines. The lab is closely paired with the lecture and features hands-on and inquiry-based lab and field studies of statistics, data presentation, writing in the format of a scientific paper, data collection (on land and on the Hudson River), water chemistry, microbiology, microscopic and macroscopic life in the river, birds and plants in Riverside Park, biodiversity on a green roof, local geology, topographical maps, compass use, and museum studies.

ENGL BC1068,True Crime,"Over the centuries, readers have been drawn to accounts of “true” crime—violent narratives involving real people and real events. And yet, as with any literary object, the notion of “truth” is always unstable—stories and their tellings are always shaped by the motivations, values, and choices of those who tell them, often with an eye toward the audience that will consume them. Whether constructed in order to moralize, to enforce or critique social or political ideologies, or purely to sell copies, “true
 crime” is a literary genre that reveals attitudes about gender, race, and class; that illustrates—and sometimes calls into question—cultural norms and mores; that calls on readers to reflect on their own morbid curiosity and assumptions and fears. In this class we will engage with a diverse selection of literary texts—spanning from the Middle Ages to the present day and from a range of genres, including pamphlets, plays, novels, and more—as well as contemporary films, a tv series, and a
 podcast. Through close reading and critical analysis, we will examine the evolution of the “true crime” genre and the cultural and societal contexts that shape the portrayal of crime for popular consumption. We will explore the ways in which texts and authors sensationalize, moralize, and convey the complexities of crime. We will analyze point of view: who’s telling the story, whom we sympathize with, and what insights we get into the minds of those committing crimes as well as those who fall prey to them. We will consider justice and policing— the role played by the law and its enforcers in shaping narratives about crime and punishment, right and wrong. Finally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of representing real-life crimes in literature, and how “true crime” narratives shape social perceptions, fears, prejudices, and notions of justice and morality.",Penelope Usher,11:40am,12:55pm,00321,,X1068-20263-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1068-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20263ENGL1068X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC1808,ROOTING FOR THE ANTIHERO     THE EVOLUTI,"How exhausting is it, really, always rooting for the antihero? Not very, our cultural and social landscape would suggest. From films to novels, popstars to political figures, contemporary culture marvels more and more at the misfits, the flawed, the scheming, the petty, the brats. Traditional heroic qualities are no longer necessary to appeal to audiences fascinated with the likes of Tony Soprano or Olivia Pope, the Punisher or Hannah Horvath. But is the antihero a product of the golden age of television? A result of our modern, revisionist impulse to reconsider the villains of our childhood? 
  
This course will explore the complex and evolving figure of the antihero from its origins in the literary canon—in, for instance, Greek tragedy and the picaresque novel—to its prominence in modern fiction, film, and television. In parallel, we will explore how the antihero functions within broader socio-political contexts—whether as a critique of institutional power, a commentary on individualism and alienation, or a reflection of our anxieties about a world in which morality is no longer absolute.
  
Key questions will include: What does it mean to be anti-heroic in the modern world? How does the antihero challenge the distinction between protagonist and antagonist? How do marginalized voices shape and redefine antiheroic figures? What is it about figures who live on the boundary between law and lawlessness—the cowboy, the vigilante, the rebel—that so appeals to us?",Victor Zarour Zarzar,10:10am,11:25am,00443,,X1808-20263-001,ROOTING FOR THE ANTIHERO,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1808-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20263ENGL1808X001,LECTURE

The initial weeks will focus on writing exercises and also deep reading of published short stories, in order to attempt to understand the space we enter when we enter a piece of fiction, what does it mean to move through it, how is it moving. Later, student work will become the main text as the focus shifts into workshop. Stories likely on the syllabus include Herman Melville’s “Bartleby, the Scrivener,” Octavia Butler’s “Speech Sounds,” Mieko Kanai’s “Rabbits,” Carmen Maria Machado’s “The Husband Stitch,” and the flash fiction of Lydia Davis.",Faculty,,,00255,,X3107-20263-001,INTRO TO FICTION WRITING,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3107-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263ENGL3107X001,WORKSHOP

Section 1, taught by Angel Nafis: Poetry Belongs With Us
 
As legend Lucille Clifton said, “poetry began when somebody walked out of a cave and looked up at the sky with wonder and said, “Ahhh.” That was the first poem.” In this class we will be demystifying the fundamentals of writing poetry by sharpening our most natural sonic and narrative instincts. We will use these instincts to guide our insights as we explore and practice specific craft elements and structural gestures—from the Ode, Elegy, and Sonnet, to Ekphrasis and Erasure. We’ll study the work of contemporary luminaries like Gwendolyn Brooks, Kaveh Akbar, Sharon Olds, Jenny Xie, June Jordan, Ocean Vuong, and more; using their example to inspire us on how best to understand and command the poetic line. Class time will include weekly writing prompts and share-outs. Come prepared to take risks and foster curiosity.
  
 
  
Section 2, taught by Miranda Field:
 
This class approaches poetry as a practice energized as much by playful provocation as by engagement with urgent issues of the day. In-class writing and weekly prompts designed to provoke creative ingenuity will keep you writing, ensuring everyone has new poems to workshop regularly. A list of quotes headed “

” starts the class off with a discussion intended to open our minds and challenge pre-conceived notions on the topic. This will be followed by other, more focused questions and propositions, providing discussion topics for each class: How do artifice and raw reality intertwine in a poem’s making? In what ways can poems deepen our understanding of ourselves, each other, and the world we share? How do we, as poets, unlock the full potential of our chosen medium, language? What do we mean by “voice” in a poem, and when and how does “voice” emerge? Required readings are central to our work together, and specified titles and volumes must be acquired by the third week of the semester.

What is the difference between a play and a film? No two playwrights will have the same response, but all must address the question. This is a class that revels in that distinction, encouraging students to explore the idiosyncrasy, strangeness, and power of the form. For half the semester, students will be writing in response to prompts that are designed to teach fundamental principles of the form. In addition to writing their own work, every week students will choose two plays from a collection of 150 to read and comment briefly on.

Section 1 (taught by Sarah Wang in Spring 2026)
 
Narrative Strategies: 
This course will explore the different ways that stories can be told. How a story is written is as important as what a story is about. Is there a turn at the end that changes everything you thought you knew? Is the narrator speaking from inside experience, reportage from the front lines of another world? How can the epistolary form be utilized to effect? Students will workshop their own stories, participate in four in-class generative writing sessions, and read weekly short stories demonstrating various strategies for style, voice, setting, dialogue, form, and point of view. Particular focus will be placed on writing from the margins and writing as an act of bearing witness.
  
Section 2 (taught by Gina Apostol in Spring 2026):
 
This course will focus particularly on crafting the literary technique of point of view in fiction. Students will craft work with this question in mind: in what ways are art and ethics combined in the crafting of point of view? Students will practice writing from different narration modes: third person limited and omniscient, free indirect discourse, first person, and so on. They will consider the ethics of point of view by reading short stories, among them stories from Borges’s 
Labyrinths
, John Keene’s 
Counternarratives
, and Angela Carter’s 
Saints and Strangers.
 Some theoretical matters will include: postcoloniality in narration; identity in narration; ‘queering’ history; and critical race thought.

What drives the music of a poem? How does one create rhythm and song? In what ways do chunks of language sort and arrange the perception of our readers? The purpose of this advanced poetry workshop is to closely study syntax, or in the words of Ellen Bryant Voigt, “the order of the words in each human utterance.” To further build upon our technical foundation as writers, we will also engage in other elements of craft, such as deep imagery, grammatical moods, tone, and poetic closure. We will be reading a variety of poets, including Etel Adnan, Rita Dove, Brigit Pegeen Kelly, John Murrillo, Choi Seungja, and Yuki Tanaka. Be prepared to generate new material independently for peer workshops where you will gain valuable feedback and constructive criticism. 
  
Apart from challenging your poetics on a technical level, I expect you to come to class with a strong desire to create meaning out of your daily lives, your personal or collective histories, and the futures that you are actively imagining.

In this class, New Yorker cartoonist and graphic novelist Liana Finck will teach you the basics of making single-panel cartoons, writing and drawing comics, and generally expressing yourself in a mixture of words and pictures. You will learn to diagram your problems, craft jokes, and tell stories visually. You’ll get an overview of useful materials, programs and machines, and how to use all these things with a light enough touch that you can still focus on your art. You will get comfortable with processes for generating ideas and editing your work. We will read some graphic novels, look at lots of cartoons, and dip a toe into the history of colloquial visual storytelling. You will finish the semester with a large body of small-scale work, one serious longer piece, and a better understanding of your voice and what you have to say.

What accounts for its increasing popularity across the eighteenth century? What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society? To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory.

ENGL BC3179,AMERICAN LITERATURE TO 1800,"This course surveys American literature written before 1800. While we will devote some attention to the literary traditions that preceded British colonization, most of our readings will be of texts written in English between 1620 and 1800. These texts--histories, autobiographies, poems, plays, and novels--illuminate the complexity of this period of American culture. They tell stories of pilgrimage, colonization, and genocide; private piety and public life; manuscript and print publication; the growth of national identity (political, cultural, and literary); Puritanism, Quakerism, and Deism; race and gender; slavery and the beginnings of a movement towards its abolition. We will consider, as we read, the ways that these stories overlap and interconnect, and the ways that they shape texts of different periods and genres.",Lisa Gordis,,,00363,,X3179-20263-001,AMERICAN LITERATURE TO 18,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3179-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263ENGL3179X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC3194,LITERARY THEORY,"In this course, we will trace the complex category of 
imitation 
from its ancient roots to some of its modern theoretical and literary manifestations. Interpreted differently by different thinkers, imitation can refer to the problem of art’s imitation of things in the world (e.g., your portrait looks like you), art’s imitation of other artistic works (e.g., your portrait looks like a Rembrandt), people’s imitation or even mimicry of one another (who does she think she is?). The latter form of imitation raises the most overtly socio-political questions, whether by replicating social power structures in order to “pass” in a potentially hostile environment or by subverting these same structures through mimicking, outwitting, critiquing, or mocking them. At its core, the category of imitation focuses our attention on what is so central to artmaking that it almost eludes our notice: the question of resemblance. Put in its simplest form: What are we doing (philosophically, artistically, socially) when we make one thing resemble another?",Rachel Eisendrath,,,00371,,X3194-20263-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3194-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ENGL3194X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3195,MODERNISM,"A deeply ambivalent, transatlantic movement, Modernism grapples with revolutionary forces that defy traditional structures: the 19th-century Darwinian inversion to the old idea of order, the advent of psychoanalysis, the crisis of world war, and the anxiety and exuberance of shifting gender paradigms. The ensuing cultural upheaval dis-orders not only the content but also the literary forms of Modernism, giving rise to abstraction, fragmented narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness prose and the extreme erudition T.S. Eliot “shored against the ruins” of so-called civilization in “The Waste Land.”  Special attention will be devoted to how seminal manifestos, most notably ""Tradition and the Individual Talent"" and 
A Room of One's Own,
 frame the movement's embattled aesthetics.  Works by Djuna Barnes, T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner,  Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Muriel Rukeyser, Jean Toomer, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Virginia Woolf, and W.B.

In this class we will explore the process of healing from trauma through the art of storytelling. We will ground ourselves in the writing of Latina authors whose work demonstrates the resistance from erasure in the United States. The goal of the class is to understand the connection between trauma and healing, through storytelling and creative writing. Moreover, we will develop three pieces of creative non-fiction that will encompass this relationship over the three different lenses of place, person and personal experience.",Maria D Hinojosa,,,00374,,X3208-20263-001,CREATIVE WRITING ON TRAUM,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3208-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263ENGL3208X001,SEMINAR

ENGL BC3249,THE MARRIAGE PLOT,"This upper-level research-oriented seminar will engage with literary expressions of the universally interesting topic of marriage. Tony Tanner in his famous 
Adultery in the Novel 
characterizes marriage as “the structure which supports all structure.” Contemporary critics have seen marriage as essential to maintaining the “family values” of the bourgeoisie; feminists and Marxists have challenged the economic assumptions of patriarchally-defined marriage. Folklorists have treated marriage as the endpoint of the search for a safe domestic space.
  
Starting in ancient times with classic fairy tales and the Hebrew Bible, moving on to a famous medieval poem, a medieval memoir, and three nineteenth-century novels, we will encounter cultural expressions which address intimate partnerships with an emphasis on marriage as a defining condition.",Margaret R Ellsberg,,,00370,,X3249-20263-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3249-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ENGL3249X001,SEMINAR

Explores the transformation of sociality, consciousness and geo-politics by and as media technologies during the long 20th century.

ENGL BC3521,GLOBAL LITERATURES IN ENGLISH,"The title of this course suggests that there are literatures across the “globe” written in English, and that we will study them. But this statement rests on a series of assumptions: the 
a priori 
existence of a globe with latitudes, longitudes, and borders; a singular category of “literature” produced in different geographical locations across the globe; and finally, that these literatures are written in English. During the course of the semester, we will investigate and (occasionally overturn) all three of these assumptions. 
  
In order to do so, we will read across different literary genres (short stories and novels, plays, poetry, and essays), while also reading texts that move between these genres or defy them altogether. We will read texts that were originally written in English, as well as texts that have been translated into English, and we will learn and discuss the term “global anglophone” along with the ways in which this term has been challenged. During our collective readings and discussions, we will map the locations that arise in each text 
and
 the locations out of which these texts arise. We will study the relationship between literature, translation, and mapping, and we will learn and discuss the concept of planetary thinking and writing as an alternative to border and global thinking.",Atefeh Akbari Shahmirzadi,,,00373,,X3521-20263-001,GLOBAL LITERATURES IN ENG,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3521-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263ENGL3521X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3645,A Literary History of Marriage,"From its origins, and to the present, marriage has been transactional, arranged, and rarely concerned with the desires or interests of the wife. In the eighteenth-century, and especially through the genre of the novel, women began to insist on right to choose their spouse, and the possibility of marrying for love. Perversely, it is at this point that the descriptions of some of the most disastrous and repressive marriages enter literature, and in the twentieth century film. If “the course of true love never did run smooth” this seminar follows its path, investigating the shifts and transformations of marriage. While the focus of the seminar will be on women, we will also consider men, same-sex marriage, questions of marriage and race in the United States, and marriage in China.",Daphne Miriam Merkin,,,00462,,X3645-20263-001,A Literary History of Mar,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3645-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ENGL3645X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3760,AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM,"In this course we probe the ideology of American “exceptionalism.” We treat the intellectual history of this idea as a transtemporal conversation among founding architects, contemporary agents, early critics, and visionary reformers, all concerned with what should be valued on the American continents and within American experience. We become cartographers of this conversation and interlocutors within it, as we explore how habits of conceiving truth, power, and the relationship of human beings to the natural world have controlled what counts as exceptional and what ordinary. Where should we direct our awe? Readings include works by Margaret Atwood, James Baldwin, Roland Barthes, Ralph Waldo Emerson, bell hooks, William James, Immanuel Kant, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Audre Lorde, Wallace Stevens, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Adrienne Rich, William Carlos Williams.",Kristi-Lynn Cassaro,,,00369,,X3760-20263-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3760-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ENGL3760X001,SEMINAR

 2019 New York Times article discussing the growing international attention being
 paid to Italian women writers, particuarly on the heels of Elena Ferrante’s
 phenomenal global success. This course will center the female voice and
 subjectivity in the Italian literary tradition, with a focus on celebrated prose writers
 active from the early twentieth century to the present. Some, recently republished
 and reconsidered for the Italian market, have also been re-translated and re-
 introduced to a wider English readership. We will trace the reception of female
 authors within the Italian critical establishment and abroad, and the role
 translation might play in broadening and amplifying their reputation and reach.
 We will focus on one author per week, paying special attention to themes of
 resistance, rebellion, and self-fashioning. All readings will be in English.",Jhumpa Lahiri,2:40pm,3:55pm,00368,,X3899-20263-001,READING ITALIANS: HER STO,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3899-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20263ENGL3899X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3992,SENIOR PROJECT IN CREATIVE WRITING,"Enrollment limited to Barnard senior English majors with a concentration in creative writing.
  
This creative writing workshop represents an opportunity for creative writing concentrators to focus on one large project that will serve as a capstone senior project. As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project—such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement. This class is about your own writing and that of your classmates.

ENRE BC3145,Jews in the Christian Imagination,"Since the beginning of the movement that would become Christianity, Jews have occupied a unique – and uniquely fraught – position in the Christian imagination. Why did so few of the very Jews to whom Jesus preached accept him as their messiah? Why, as the Church grew in wealth and influence, did Jews continue to live in Christian communities, and what was their proper place in Christian society? In our course, we will read early and medieval Christian narratives about Jews that are, in many ways, an attempt to answer these questions – dark imaginative visions of Jews as child-killers, cannibals, and devil worshippers. We will use narrative, psychological, and literary theory as tools to analyze these tales and to make sense of their complicated and continuing legacy.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,,,00339,,X3145-20263-001,Jews in Christian Imagina,English @Barnard,ENRE,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENRE/X3145-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263ENRE3145X001,SEMINAR

Priority is given to Film Studies majors/concentrations in order of class seniority. Corequisites: (Since this is a Film course, it does not count as a writing course for English majors with a Writing Concentration.)
  
This course is ideal for writers of their FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD screenplays. The first several weeks will focus on STORY: What it is, what it isn’t, how to recognize the difference. How to find your own individual stories that nobody else in the universe can tell.
  
From there we will make the transition to the highly individualized techniques, the strengths and limitations, the dynamics of telling a SCREEN STORY; what to leave in, what to leave out. As Michelangelo puts it—starting with a block of marble and chipping away everything that isn’t David.  Through studies of existing screenplays and films in coordination with and hands-on writing exercises which we will share in class, we will develop our skills in all aspects of screenwriting; building fascinating characters, dialogue, story construction (The BIG PICTURE) and scene construction (The Small Picture)

FILM BC3201,INTRO FILM & MEDIA STUDIES,"Prerequisites: Open to first-year students.
  
We derive much of our information about the world from visual media. Social networks, television, cinema: all shape our aesthetic sensibilities and our political visions. Yet we often lack a basic understanding of what could be called “visual literacy.” This introductory course gives students the critical tools to analyze how film and other visual media 
really
 work – in order to appreciate their artistic and social achievements, as well as to guard against their insidious manipulative devices.
  
In the first part of the semester, we focus on 
film analysis
 through a detailed study of the different production phases of filmmaking – from screenwriting and mise-en-scène to editing and film scoring. We pay special attention to the way in which certain stylistic and narrative choices have particular ideological effects. The second part of the course looks at 
film history
 
through a comprehensive, chronological overview of its main movements and periods, including the coming of sound in Hollywood cinema, post-war Italian Neorealism, the emergence of world 
auteurs
, New Waves of the 1960s and 1970s, etc. Students will use the hermeneutical tools learnt in film analysis to intellectually engage with some masterworks of film history. In the third and final part of the semester, we study the major debates of 
film theory
 from perspectives such as auteurism, formalism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, postcolonial and queer studies, etc.

This course will take a closer look at the format of the American Drama and how it has served as a cultural tool since its inception, reflecting the concerns of the time in one form or another.

FILM BC3250,ADAPTATION,"In the same way that there can never be a single objective account of an historical event, using one medium to convey a story first told in another is never as straightforward as it might seem. Translating the essence of an existing story to the screen may require making significant changes to the events or characters as they were originally presented. As a screenwriter faced with such an adaptation, you must understand the idiosyncrasies of your craft well enough to recognize what to keep, what to change, and what to leave behind.

Please note that since this is a Film Studies course, it does not count as a creative writing course for English majors with a creative writing concentration. This course will focus on the primary pillar of television production: the teleplay. Through a number of creative exercises, students will learn the intricacies of the unique screenwriting formats that are the half-hour and hour-long teleplays. Together we will cover the differences between an episode arc and a seasonal one, the requirements of A/B/C story plotting, and how to write an effective show bible. We will survey the existing pantheon of great television writing in order to help students narrow in on their individual sensibilities.

both 
FILM BC3201 (or equivalent)

The Digital Series course is intended to take students from story ideation through creation of an independent digital series. Emanating from a writers room setting, all steps of the process will be explored and supported by in-class discussion, examples and workshops. This hands-on class revolves around the TV series production model: breaking story, writing pages, preproduction planning, filming and post-production review.

What literary traditions and models do they draw on? How different are those texts written in French for a global audience, as opposed to those written in Persian or Arabic? What are the effects of reading them in translation?

It understands the Cold War as a multi-national and multi-layered conflict, which not only pitted two superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—against one another, but also a plethora of state and non-state actors that framed their actions as part of a larger struggle for the fate of humanity. In Latin America in particular, the idea of socialist revolution posed a significant challenge to both capitalism and United States hegemony. We will pay special attention to revolutionary and counterrevolutionary events in Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua, probing the motives, actions, and influence of local and foreign actors in such events.",Alfonso Salgado,4:10pm,5:25pm,00649,,X2697-20263-001,The Cold War in Latin Ame,History @Barnard,HIST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2697-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20263HIST2697X001,LECTURE
HIST BC2803,GENDER AND EMPIRE,"This course provides a political and social history of India from the 16th-19th century, focusing on the Mughal empire. Two central concerns: first, the Mughal regnal politics towards their rival imperial concerns within India and West Asia (the Maratha, the Rajput, the Safavid, the Ottoman); and second, the foreign gaze onto the Mughals (via the presence of Portuguese, English, and French travelers, merchants, and diplomats in India). These interlocked practices (how Mughals saw the world and how the world saw the Mughals) will allow us develop a nuanced knowledge of universally acknowledged power of the early modern world.

HRTS UN3934,Seeking Sanctuary in New York City,"In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum – the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that of a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city’s long history of refuge? 
  
This course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection.
  
This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.",Jennifer Trowbridge,,,00248,,V3934-20263-001,Seeking Sanctuary in New,Human Rights (HRTB),HRTS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/V3934-20263-001/,,,,5,,,20263HRTS3934V001,SEMINAR

NSBV BC3381,Visual Neuroscience: From the Eyeball to,"By absorbing electromagnetic radiation through their eyes, people are able to catch frisbees, recognize faces, and judge the beauty of art. For most of us, seeing feels effortless. That feeling is misleading. Seeing requires not only precise optics to focus images on the retina, but also the concerted action of millions of nerve cells in the brain. This intricate circuitry infers the likely causes of incoming patterns of light and transforms that information into feelings, thoughts, and actions. In this course we will study how light evokes electrical activity in a hierarchy of specialized neural networks that accomplish many unique aspects of seeing. Students will have the opportunity to focus their study on particular aspects, such as color, motion, object recognition, learning, attention, awareness, and how sight can be lost and recovered.  Throughout the course we will discuss principles of neural information coding (e.g., receptive field tuning, adaptation, normalization, etc.) that are relevant to other areas of neuroscience, as well as medicine, engineering, art and design.",Alex White,10:10am,12:00pm,00313,,X3381-20263-001,VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3381-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20263NSBV3381X001,SEMINAR

NSBV BC3591,NEUROSCIENCE GUIDED RESEARCH,"This lab-based course introduces students to advanced methods in cognitive neuroscience, focusing on the application of electroencephalography (EEG) for real-time recording of brain activity. Unlike traditional approaches that study how the brain responds to different external stimuli or task demands, this course centers on spontaneous brain activity that occurs during rest or just before experimental events. Whether or not spontaneous brain activity is just meaningless noise remains an active area of research in cognitive neuroscience. Some researchers believe that spontaneous brain activity may be an important factor shaping our subjective experience of the world. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive in part due to the challenges in objectively defining and measuring subjective experience.
  
In this course, students will address this challenge by developing methods to study the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and subjective experience, with a particular focus on mind-wandering and the sensory phenomena elicited by Ganzflicker and Ganzfeld stimulation. The course culminates in independent research projects where students test their hypotheses by collecting and analyzing behavioral and EEG data. Key questions to address include: can spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity account for why people sometimes zone out while performing a task? Can the same fluctuations explain why people sometimes have different sensory experiences despite constant external stimuli? Do individual variations in spontaneous brain activity help explain why some people are more likely to report such experiences?
  
Note: The course involves weekly in person meetings as well as asynchronous work on data acquisition, analysis, and primary article readings for approximately 6 additional hours per week (on average).",Kara Pham,1:00pm,5:00pm,00317,,X3591-20263-001,NEUROSCIENCE GUIDED RESEA,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3591-20263-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20263NSBV3591X001,LABORATORY

POLS BC3025,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES,"Political parties have evoked widespread scorn in the U.S. since the founding era; and yet, they arose almost immediately and have endured for over two centuries. In this course, we will examine why parties formed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major party.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties are, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over time as organizations, in the electorate, and in government. Topics will include the presidential nomination process from the founding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season, the life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political parties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward. Throughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How much is too much? We will address these difficult questions, among others, in this broad survey of American political parties.",Katherine L Krimmel,,,00826,,X3025-20263-001,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIE,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3025-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263POLS3025X001,LECTURE

Who is the subject of feminist politics? What is the meaning of “difference,” and how can—or should—feminists seek to organize across it? What are appropriate topics for politics, and what should remain private? Is the family a space for politics? The household? The body? How much of the personal can, and should, be made political?

This course examines how thinkers of contrasting perspectives have understood capitalism politically. Some have celebrated the market as an escape from coercion, while others criticize it as a source of disguised domination; some see capitalism as leveling social hierarchies, while others point to its creation of class and racial hierarchy; some see capitalism as an engine of wealth creation and heightened living standards, while others emphasize its destruction of existing ways of life and production of inequality; some see capitalism as an engine of peace, while others emphasize its reliance on violence. In particular, we will consider the relationship between state and market, moral critiques of markets and exchange, analyses of the role of force and violence in accumulation, and theories of freedom and domination.",Alyssa Battistoni,,,00828,,X3048-20263-001,COLL: CAPITALISM & ITS CR,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3048-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263POLS3048X001,COLLOQUIA

In particular, we will consider the role of grassroots movements and organizations as agents of democratic representation and catalysts for political transformation for marginalized communities. We will engage key questions about why groups choose to make political demands outside of formal institutional spaces, what kinds of visions for social change they put forward, how they seek to achieve their ideals, and how successful they are.

POLS BC3367,Colloquium: Transnational Kleptocracy,"The term “kleptocracy” literally means “rule by thieves” and refers to the extensive grand corruption that elite rulers, allies and their family members engage in to privately enrich themselves at the expense of their populations. Traditionally, kleptocracy has been viewed as a scourge on developing countries, associated with greedy authoritarian rulers in conflict-prone, resource rich and/or aid dependent states. However, in recent years scholars and policymakers have increasingly become aware of the critical role played by international actors, institutions, legal structures and professional service providers that facilitate kleptocracy at a global level. Unlike other transnational illicit sectors such as narcotics trafficking or terrorism, many aspects of kleptocracy networks are publicly visible and perfectly legal. Overall, these networks function to enable the domestic plundering of these elites, the whitewashing of their reputations, and the exacerbation of vast inequality, both within the countries that kleptocrats systemically plunder and between the Global South and the West which receives and benefits from many of the proceeds of these corrupt activities. 
  
The first part of the course (Weeks 2-5) examines the transnational actors, service professionals and institutions that facilitate money laundering by kleptocrats. The second part (Weeks 6-7) concentrates on how kleptocrats launder their reputations, by presenting themselves as global philanthropists or business professionals and by acquiring residency in other jurisdictions through the growing market for citizenship.  The final part of the course (Weeks 8-10) examines recent developments in international policy efforts to counter kleptocracy, including incorporating such efforts into national security strategies, enacting extraterritorial legislation to punish corporate bribery, sanctioning individual kleptocrats and oligarchs, and amending libel laws in countries like the UK that are routinely used by kleptocrats to intimidate journalists and deter investigations into their dealings.  
  
Finally, throughout the course we will grapple with the methodological challenges posed by trying to study and detect illegal and secretive patterns of behavior. What are the tools, resources and research techniques available to researchers and policy makers interested in making more evidence-based assessments about kleptocracy and grand corruption?",Alexander A Cooley,,,00830,,X3367-20263-001,COLL: TRANSNTNL KLEPTOCRA,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3367-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263POLS3367X001,COLLOQUIA

POLS BC3513,POLITICS OF ILLICIT ECONOMIES IN THE AME,"A major challenge for governments across the Western Hemisphere is the complex relationship between illicit economies, violence, and politics. We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods where drugs are trafficked to the Amazon where illegal extraction of natural resources poses significant threats to the environment at the local and global levels. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit economies touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, environmental degradation, state corruption, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on the Western Hemisphere. Throughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues to broader theories, concepts and empirical findings in political science.",Eduardo Moncada,,,00833,,X3513-20263-001,ILLICIT ECON IN THE AMERI,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3513-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263POLS3513X001,LECTURE

RELI BC2003,Religion and Political Thought,"Are “belief” and “reason” two different things? What is the proper role of religion in modern society? How do we determine what is just and unjust in the absence of a Higher Law? Does religion continue to influence political decision-making in liberal democracies, and if so, how? These questions continue to animate debates about the relationship between religion and politics today. This class examines articulations of and responses to this question in the political thought of the Enlightenment, a period that has traditionally been described as the moment when “the West” parted ways with religion and religious belief as the foundation for its understanding of truth, justice, and social order. In this class, we will examine classic and overlooked works of Enlightenment philosophy. We will interrogate whether the Enlightenment really signaled a departure from religion. We will also examine whether the Enlightenment was the preserve — much less the invention — of white Europeans and American settlers. We will do so with an eye toward the politics of the present, examining how Enlightenment thought’s engagement with religion produced discourses of race, gender, economy, and nationhood that continue to shape the terms of political discourse today.",Timothy Vasko,,,00205,,X2003-20263-001,Religion and Political Th,Religion @Barnard,RELI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X2003-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263RELI2003X001,LECTURE
RELI BC3096,"More than Real: Dreams, Imagination, and","This course is thematic, though a loose history of dreaming, imaginative praxis, and virtual reality environments across South Asia will emerge through the networked conversations across texts. The advantage of a thematic course allows us to cover various genres such as: ritual manuals; epic; poetry; philosophical argument; biographical accounts; prophecies; conversion stories; and medical textbooks to name a handful. At the end of the course, we will see how the texts encountered in the first part have been repurposed to speak to social justice movements around caste - both within South Asia and the diaspora population in the U.S. The thematic of dreaming and imagination also provides flexibility in method: because students will have the opportunity to study conversations between different historical actors across religious traditions about dreams, they will also have the opportunity to revise problematic accounts of religious pluralism and communalism in South Asia. Students will read primary texts from Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Sikh traditions to name a handful. Students can look forward to reading about worlds within rocks; falling asleep and waking up as another person only to die in the dream world, wake up and then realize your dream-life family is somehow real and looking for you; how to finally interpret those pesky dreams about teeth falling out; dismembered bodies generating the universe; daydreaming about a cloud that thinks mountain peaks look like nipples; how to build a mind-temple that Shiva prefers to the physical one with fancy rock; and much more!",Meghan E Hartman,,,00206,,X3096-20263-001,More Than Real,Religion @Barnard,RELI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X3096-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263RELI3096X001,SEMINAR

RELI GU4322,EXPLORING THE SHARIA: ISLAMIC LAW,"The platform of every modern “Islamist” political party calls for the implementation of “the shari‘a.” This term is invariably (and incorrectly) interpreted as an unchanging legal code dating back to 7th century Arabia. In reality, Islamic law is an organic and constantly evolving human project aimed at ascertaining God’s will in a given historical and cultural context. This course offers a detailed and nuanced look at the Islamic legal methodology and its evolution over the last 1400 years. The first part of the semester is dedicated to “classical” Islamic jurisprudence, concentrating on the manner in which jurists used the Qur’an, the Sunna (the model of the Prophet), and rationality to articulate a coherent legal system. The second part of the course focuses on those areas of the law that engender passionate debate and controversy in the contemporary world. Specifically, we examine the discourse surrounding Islamic family (medical ethics, marriage, divorce, women’s rights) and criminal (capital punishment, apostasy, suicide/martyrdom) law. The course ends by discussing the legal implications of Muslims living as minorities in non-Islamic countries and the effects of modernity on the foundations of Islamic jurisprudence. This class is designed for students interested in a close examination of the Islamic legal system; it is not a broad introduction to the Islamic religion.

The class is structured around key theoretical readings from a range of academic disciplines ranging from art history and anthropology to comparative literature and religion.
  
The course begins by placing the controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in historical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination of modern portrayals of Muslims in film that highlights both the vilification of the “other” (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial discourses centered on the “native informant” (Mamdani). Particular emphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these simplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits Muhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to understand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then examined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on the problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod).

RELI GU4998,RELIGION AND THE INDIAN WARS,"The frontier is central to the United States’ conception of its history and place in the world. It is an abstract concept that reflects the American mythology of progress and is rooted in religious ideas about land, labor, and ownership. Throughout the nineteenth century, these ideas became more than just abstractions. They were tested, hardened, and revised by U.S. officials and the soldiers they commanded on American battlefields. This violence took the form of the Civil War as well as the series of U.S. military encounters with Native Americans known as the Indian Wars. These separate yet overlapping campaigns have had profound and lasting consequences for the North American landscape and its peoples.
  
This course explores the relationship between religious ideology and violence in the last half of nineteenth century. Organized chronologically and geographically, we will engage with both primary sources and classic works in the historiography of the Indian Wars to examine how religion shaped U.S. policy and race relations from the start of the Civil War through approximately 1910.",Tiffany Hale,,,00215,,W4998-20263-001,RELIGION AND THE INDIAN W,Religion @Barnard,RELI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/W4998-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263RELI4998W001,SEMINAR

SOCI BC3202,Structural Drivers of Health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Drivers of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the ""Social"" ""Determinants"" of Health to the “Structural” ""Drivers"" of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact  and drive health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes.",Maati Momplaisir,,,00768,,X3202-20263-001,STRUCTURAL DRIVERS OF HEA,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/X3202-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263SOCI3202X001,LECTURE

URBS GU4000,ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Prerequisite: Successful completion of URBS UN2200 Introduction to GIS Methods, or equivalent with instructor permission.
  
With the veritable explosion of urban data alongside the continued proliferation of new tools for its consideration, this course allows students to develop specialized approaches to spatial analysis while introducing a series of common advanced techniques and nuanced methodological questions. Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.
  
Among others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.
  
The course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar. Seminar-style presentation and discussion will rely heavily on student participation and preparation to consider the variety of spatial methods available and their implications on urban research and intervention. Woven throughout the semester is the development of a self-driven research project, through which students will engage and compare the methodological advantages and disadvantages of several assumptions, approaches, analyses, and datasets.",Leah M Meisterlin,2:10pm,4:00pm,00391,,V4000-20263-001,ADV GEOGRAPHIC INFO SYSTE,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V4000-20263-001/,To be announced,,,3,URBS UN2200,M,20263URBS4000V001,LECTURE

URBS UN2520,INTRODUCTION TO URBAN PLANNING,"This course is a basic introduction to the field and practice of urban planning in the United States. The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment.
  
The core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more “livable” cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice.
  
The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning.",Faculty,,,00383,,V2520-20263-001,INTRO TO URBAN PLANNING,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V2520-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263URBS2520V001,LECTURE
URBS UN3308,INTRO TO URBAN ETHNOGRAPHIES,"What is ethnography and what makes ethnography “urban”? This course explores how social scientists use ethnography to analyze questions and dilemmas often associated with urban settings. We will combine close readings of ethnographies with field-based inquiry, including our own studies of urban public space. Through both our readings and our field exercises, we will focus on the methods at the heart of ethnography: observation and participant-observation.
  
As we read other scholars’ work, we will ask how the author uses ethnographic tools to explore issues that are suitable for intensive fieldwork. We will assess which kinds of research problems and theoretical perspectives are a good fit with ethnography and the roles that ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects. You will apply what you have learned about research to design your own pilot fieldwork. The ethnographies that we read together will examine intersections of housing, race, and class in urban communities. You are welcome to extend this focus to your own fieldwork, but it’s not required to do so. This is a writing-intensive course, and we will devote a considerable portion of class time to workshop your individual projects.",Dominic T Walker,,,00384,,V3308-20263-001,INTRO/URBAN ETHNOGRAPHIES,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3308-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263URBS3308V001,COLLOQUIA

And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.

URBS UN3450,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY DVLP,"New York City is made up of more than 400 neighborhoods. The concept of neighborhoods in cities has had many meanings and understandings over time. Equally complex is the concept of community used to describe the people attached to or defined by neighborhood. While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial, social, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community often refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers, investors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their environment. Community development is “a process where these community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems” that result from the changing contexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and approaches, residents organize themselves or work with community development practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable housing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically, develop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing markets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods, community development organizations are taking on new roles and adapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region and nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural diversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in federal policy.  For more than a century, city-dwellers—and especially New Yorkers—have been tackling these challenges. This course will examine both historic and contemporary community building and development efforts, paying special attention to approaches which were shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a “city of neighborhoods,” has long been a seedbed for community-based problem-solving inventions. The course will focus on the theories (why?), tools (how?), and actors (who?) within the field of community development practice and is organized around important sectors (housing, econom",Faculty,,,00385,,W3450-20263-001,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/W3450-20263-001/,,,,3,,,20263URBS3450W001,LECTURE

WMST BC4325,EMBODIMENT AND BODILY DIFFERENCE,"At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersection of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures—including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies—to consider some of the ways in which the body is constituted by such discourses, and itself serves as the substratum for social relations. Among the key questions we will consider are the following: What is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between presumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic and somatic experiences?  How do historical and political-economic forces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference? And most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by competing logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance to these and other categorizations?",Rebecca Jordan-Young,,,00600,,X4325-20263-001,EMBODIMENT & BODILY DIFFE,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X4325-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263WMST4325X001,SEMINAR
WMST GU4100,Modes of Living:  Feminist and Critical,"Connecting cultural and social issues to ethical questions, this course in feminist and critical interdisciplinary studies offers students the opportunity to consider the relationship between values and value in different modes of living. All too often in public discourse ethical values are invoked but not clearly articulated in terms of their meaning, parameters, and relation to each other. This research seminar investigates values through a semester-long consideration of a single overarching question. This version of the course focuses on the environmental humanities, but other instantiations may use this method to consider different issues. Here, the values commonly invoked in public discussions of the environment are considered in relation to each other, placed in larger analytic contexts, and applied. The final section of the course brings the study of values together with a study of major environmental issues, with a focus on inter-relations amongst those issues. The course uses these interdisciplinary and critical approaches that have become central to feminist ethics as the basis for students developing a major semester-long research project on a question of their own choosing.",Janet Jakobsen,,,00598,,W4100-20263-001,Feminist & Critical Appro,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W4100-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263WMST4100W001,SEMINAR
WMST GU4210,BLACK GEOGRAPHIES,"Far from obvious renderings of place, maps are spatial arguments about who belongs where and how living should be defined. This course approaches place as something that is contested daily in the U.S. through the struggle of who gets to lay claim to a way of life. From the landscapes of dispossession to the alternative ways marginalized people work with and against traditional geographies, this course centers Black place-making practices as political struggle. This class will look at how power and domination become a landed project. We will critically examine how ideas about “nature” are bound up with notions of race, and the way “race” naturalizes the proper place for humans and non-human others. We will interrogate settler colonialism’s relationships to mapping who is and isn’t human, the transatlantic slave trade as a project of terraforming environments for capital, and land use as a science for determining who “owns” the earth. Centered on Black feminist, queer and trans thinkers, we will encounter space not as a something given by maps, but as a struggle over definitions of the human, geography, sovereignty, and alternative worlds. To this end, we will read from a variety of disciplines, such as Critical Black Studies, Feminist and Intersectional Science Studies, Black Geographies and Ecologies, Urban Studies and Afrofuturist literature. (Note: this class will count as an elective for the CCIS minors/concentrations in F/ISTS, ICORE/MORE, and Environmental Humanities.)",Marisa Solomon,,,00599,,W4210-20263-001,,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W4210-20263-001/,,,,4,,,20263WMST4210W001,SEMINAR
