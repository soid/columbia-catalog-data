AFAS S3930,TOPICS IN THE BLACK EXPERIENCE,"Gospel Music in Modern America This course will track the evolution of religion and music in African American history across the twentieth century to the present day. Beginning with the emergence of the Gospel-Blues during the 1920s, we will explore the ways in cultural aesthetics, religious imaginings and institutional formations have come together to shape the development of black musical forms, sacred and secular alike, across the evolving genres of blues, jazz, r&b, hip hop, neo-soul and more.",Josef Sorett,1:00pm,4:10pm,73215,Morningside,S3930-20162-001,GOSPEL MUSIC IN MODERN AMERICA,"African-American Studies, Institute for Research in",AFAS,http://culpa.info/professors/9341,silver,3.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Sorett,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623144544/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AFAS/S3930-20162-001/,758 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3422,HARLEM RENAISSANCE VIS CULTURE,"In this seminar we will explore a variety of creative traditions associated with the so-called Harlem Renaissance of the early twentieth century. Tracing the production and reception of Black Art from the Gilded Age through the WPA projects of the 1930s, we will look at how artists and critics such as Aaron Douglas, William H. Johnson, Lois Maillou Jones, Archibald Motley, Richmond Barthé, Josephine Baker, W.E.B. DuBois and Alain Locke defined their aesthetic and cultural goals and their relationship to mainstream art and society. Because the Harlem Renaissance is a phenomenon that impacted the African diaspora broadly, we will look at visual culture produced outside of New York City, in the Midwest, the Caribbean and in Europe, alongside that of our own neighborhood. Because artists explored a variety of genre to reach Black audiences, our survey will include photography, film, illustration and mural painting alongside the studio arts most frequently associated with art's history. Among the cultural topics to be investigated are the significance of rural and urban identities and the impact of the Great Migration, the question of genre in relationship to a black audience, the significance of Africa and the diaspora on art and identity, and the roles of gender and sexuality in the production and reception of Black art. In addition to exploring the scholarship on Black Art in the U.S. between the World Wars, students will undertake a research project involving materials from the Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroana in Columbia's Rare Books Collection. (see https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/gumby) This seminar is organized primarily around class discussion.

Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.  Class lectures and presentations will be supplemented with trips to New York's world-renowned museums.",Kent M Minturn,1:00pm,4:10pm,25357,Morningside,S3643-20162-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/353,silver,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623151108/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3643-20162-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3997,"MUSEUMS, INTERRUPTED","Museums don't simply display art-they actively construct the meaning of the objects they contain. An object in a natural history museum is interpreted differently than it would be if it appeared in a contemporary ""white cube"" gallery, for example. What are the politics of exhibition spaces? What are the implicit messages that museums send through the way they organize space and direct us as viewers? How do they shape our understanding of art, culture, and history? Since the late 1960s, artists have made artworks that intervene into museum spaces by making their codes explicit, testing their limits, or disrupting their messages. This course is dedicated to critically examining these interventions and the spaces where they took place. Each of the first three weeks will be focused on the study of a New York art institution (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Natural History, The Museum of Modern Art) and related artist interventions; the remaining half of the course will be structured thematically. Class time will combine lectures offering historical context with student presentations and group discussion. Three class trips to museums will give opportunity for hands-on fieldwork guided by critical questions that engage the spaces and exhibitions on display. Throughout this course, we will evaluate these artists' claims firsthand and ask ourselves what, if anything, has changed since their interventions first took place.",Leah S Pires,1:00pm,4:10pm,97846,Morningside,S3997-20162-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623151109/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3997-20162-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

This seminar introduces the richness of the African artistic production using local collections as privileged sites to study these objects, their histories and display. Visits to local museums will be combined with in-class discussions and conversations with collectors and curators who are shaping the field of African art, from the classical to the contemporary. Structured in a roughly chronological order, the course does not offer a comprehensive survey. Rather, it focuses on pivotal moments in the history of collecting and exhibiting African art from the nineteenth century to the present day. Through formal analysis of objects that vary in media, time and location, and close reading of secondary sources we will learn to understand the consonances and dissonances between conditions of production and consumption of African art.",Giulia Paoletti,9:00am,12:00pm,15896,Morningside,S4070-20162-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623151110/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S4070-20162-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S4423,THE CRUSADES: NYC COLLECTIONS,"Few events fostered more intensive cultural exchange between East and West during the Middle Ages than the military campaigns now known as the Crusades. This seminar investigates how crusaders' privileged access to cherished religious sites in the Holy Land, particularly those in and around Jerusalem, transformed modes of material production both in the Latin East, namely the Crusader States of Syro-Palestine, and in the Latin West. The course begins by taking stock of recent literature concerning the scope, intent, and effects of the crusading movement from the capture of Jerusalem in 1096 to the fall of Acre in 1291. It then takes a closer look at Jerusalem, especially its major pilgrimage sites, before examining the wider material culture of the Crusader States: from large-scale works of architecture, sculpture, and mural decoration to small-scale objects such as relics/reliquaries, manuscripts, and panel paintings. It closes, finally, by exploring the effects of crusading ideology on what might be termed the material imaginary of Western Europe, focusing on case studies in England, France, and Iberia. Recurrent themes will include power, patronage, devotion, exchange, appropriation, colonization, hybridity, and cultural memory. During the term, students will make visits to and complete assignments at several local collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cloisters Museum, and the Morgan Library. The course anticipates an important exhibition at the Met, ""Every People Under Heaven: Jerusalem, 1000-1400,"" set to open in September 2016. Students will enjoy special ""behind the scenes"" access to this exhibition in order to better appreciate the rich cultural heritage of the city before, during, and after the Crusades.",Zachary D Stewart,1:00pm,4:10pm,62193,Morningside,S4423-20162-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623151111/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S4423-20162-001/,934 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Columbia College

AHIS S4425,ARTS BET ITALY & EASTRN MEDIT,"This course will explore the role of the visual arts within networks of cultural exchange, focusing particularly on the relationship between the Italian peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Concrete points of interactionincluding collecting practices, the travel of artists, and the market for luxury goods-will be considered alongside broader intellectual exchanges that resulted in new formulations within visual culture--such as the influence of Arabic science on the development of perspectival painting and the recuperation of a common Byzantine past in architectural design. In this way we will probe previous boundaries-both geographic and materialinscribed within long-standing notions of the European Renaissance, thus entering into dialogue with current scholarship that seeks new ways of understanding the early modem period. A key component of the course will include visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to allowing us to examine works of art first hand, we will also be able to consider how the mecha.Iisms of display within the museum context further inflect contemporary understanding of these historical objects. In this regard the Metropolitan Museum serves as an excellent resource not only for the breadth of its collections, but also due to its recent reorganization of those Galleries previously grouped under the heading Islamic Art. The newly anointed Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia, will present an interesting case study for the students.

This course will focus on the buildings, parks, and other venues in New York constructed specifically for play and relaxation. Organized typologically, it will cover everything from parks, playgrounds, and Broadway theaters, to World's Fairs, hotels, and museums-- places in which the city's residents seek escape from the stress of their daily lives. In the classroom, in the archival collections of Avery Library and in numerous field trips around the city and the phot, we will analyze these structures and milieux from the perspective of architectural history and urban design, trace their origins and development from the founding of the city to the present and look at how they have helped cut across but also harden class lines. We will examine the formal differences between high-brow and popular venues, discuss the problems of private and public patronage, as well as the financial and social impact of the entertainment industry on the wellbeing of the city as a whole.

AHIS S4637,"AMER ART IN ""LONG"" 19TH CENT","Through an examination of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography and the visual culture of the United States from 1750 to 1914, the course will explore how American artists responded to and operated within the wider world. Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the ""long"" nineteenth century, ranging from Romanticism to Modernism. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using, and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the profound changes that occurred during the Civil War. The class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad. In addition to lectures/discussions in the classroom, field trips to the Metropolitan Museum (the American Wing, Nineteenth Century Wing, Galleries of Modem and Contemporary Art, and the Photography Study Collection), the Museum of Modem Art and the Whitney Museum of Art, represent a vital aspect of the course. One of the important questions raised in the class is the recent reinterpretation of American art's interaction with international movements in museum installations and scholarship, moving away from an isolationist approach to one that engages with global influence and awareness. Readings will draw not only from primarily sources, but also from many of the publications of the Terra Foundation, whose exhibitions and research programs work to encourage an understanding and exploration of American Art from a global context.",Page S Knox,1:10pm,4:10pm,92946,Morningside,S4637-20162-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/1214,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623151117/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S4637-20162-001/,832 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor.

Approaching ethnographic and historical materials concerning violence and healing, discipline and labor, machinery and embodiment, affects and resistance in terms of the ontological claims they presuppose or make in relation to philosophies of the body, this course has the distinctive aim of demonstrating how histories of the body are co-implicated with histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, capital, science and technology, and mass mediation.

CLEN S3208,MODERN COMPARATIVE FICTION,"This course takes the “impression” as a cue to explore fiction, philosophy, and visual art of the period from roughly 1874, the year of the first Impressionist exhibition, to 1925, well into the Modernist period, in order to understand how and why “impressionism” came to have such central importance for writers, artists, and other thinkers. We will ask how and why this idea developed over time, how it influenced and was influenced by movements in realism and Modernism, and how the idea of the impression continues to influence the arts today. This class will be both international in scope, focusing on works by French, British, and American authors, and interdisciplinary, encompassing works of different literary genres, including the novel, the short story, and the sketch, as well as works of painting, photography, philosophy, psychology, and criticism. Each week will include discussions of numerous paintings of the period, and we will often focus on the relationships between different artistic media. The course will also include field trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Authors to be covered include Zola, Maupassant, Pater, James, Crane, Hemingway, Ford, and Woolf.

CLEN S3690,FEMALE BODY IN FICT & NON FICT,"The seminar investigates a range of American novels and short stories from the nineteenth and early twentieth century to explore how literature can offer creative avenues that challenge hegemonic science discourses, in which women are determined by the biology of their bodies. With the predominance of today’s evidence-based medicine and rapid advances in biomedical research (e.g., genetics, reproductive medicine), the discourses and rhetorical strategies in the nineteenth century still resonate today. The “biological clock,” for example, as well as other metaphors of the female body, have become so naturalized that we hardly realize how they are based on and construct a restrictive concept of femininity. Therefore, we will ask how we can “use” the novelists’ work to (re-)imagine the role of women and their bodies as well as the role of science and medicine today.",Anita Wohlmann,1:00pm,4:10pm,67083,Morningside,S3690-20162-001,,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623170143/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/S3690-20162-001/,201B Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

CLEN S3851,VIOL & HUM RIGHTS IN WORLD LIT,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). This course hopes to entice you into readings in the literature of lost and submerged continents, as well as of remote lands hidden from history. While now often relegated to the stuff of science fiction, accounts of submerged land-masses were among the most serious popular literature of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and readers were riveted by the enduring mystery about the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria. Works about these and other lost lands inspired a form of ""occult ethnography."" Novels such as 
The Coming Race
 (1871) drew on the popular fascination with buried land-masses in order to re-imagine alternative narratives in which the ""imperial English"" would be colonized by a new race of people rising from the forgotten depths of the earth. At one level, the use of ethnographic details in such novels provided an ironic commentary on the European ethnographies of colonized peoples. But at another level it also offered a visionary description of a world as yet unseen and unknown, so that the idea of the past itself becomes less stable in the cultural imagination. In animating the details of a rediscovered people, occult ethnography both drew on and subverted evolutionary models of development by showing that these ""lost"" people, in some instances, had reached the highest perfection possible, both in technological capability and human potential. The unsettling of established and familiar conceptions of nation, history, and cultural identity through the exploration of lost or drifting lands reaches an apex in José Saramago's 
The Stone Raft 
(1986). In probing the enduring fascination with lost or separated lands in the cultural imagination, the course hopes to illuminate the importance of such literature in unveiling the processes of colonization, ethnography, nationalism, evolution, and technology, as well as understanding the writing of history itself: i.e., what is included in mainstream accounts and what is left out. Readings will include works by Plato, Bacon, Bulwer-Lytton, Blavatsky, Verne, Haggard, Wells, Hilton, and Saramago. Course requirements: Two short papers (4-6 pages), one final paper (8-10 pages), active class participation, and regular attendance.

CLGM S3920,THE WORLD RESPONDS TO GREEKS,"This course examines the way particular spaces - cultural, urban, literary - serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on the themes of the polis, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces - complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages - and ask: How central is the classical past in Western imagination? How have great metropolises such as Paris, Istanbul, and New York fashioned themselves in response to the allure of the classical and the advent of modern Greece?",Dimitrios Antoniou,9:00am,12:10pm,77609,Morningside,S3920-20162-001,,Classics,CLGM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623160240/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLGM/S3920-20162-001/,607 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

CLRS S3306,ON CHEKOV'S STAGE,"This course introduces students to the innovative and influential plays of Anton Chekhov. At the turn of the century, Chekhov's plays challenged established tropes of what constituted the ""theatrical,"" rejected explicit requirements for ""comedy"" and ""tragedy,"" and questioned received knowledge about what makes a subject or person worthy of our attention, thereby transforming our notions not only of theater but also of the human experience. What was the new ""stage"" that Chekhov's plays created and what was his role in theater's development toward realism and modernism?In this course, we read eight Chekhov plays, focusing principally on his four masterpieces The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, and The Cherry Orchard. Our reading is supplemented by sources that place Chekhov into his cultural context, concentrating particularly on his fraught relationship with those who first produced his plays-the Moscow Art Theater and the director Constantin Stanislavski.Through close reading and contextualization, students will attain an intimacy with Chekhov'splays and a broader understanding of how Chekhov's innovations in realist theater have influenced contemporary drama. This course features three field trips to theaters and communities that regularly work with Chekhov's plays, including the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, a direct inheritor of Stanislavski's ""method"" technique, which was highly influenced by Chekhov's plays.This course will satisfy the Slavic Department's requirement for a course in Russian literatureor culture, and as a CLRS course, requirements in Comparative Literature as well.",Molly R Avila,1:00pm,4:10pm,12815,Morningside,S3306-20162-001,,Slavic Languages,CLRS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160905205122/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLRS/S3306-20162-001/,607 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

CLRS S3307,PICTURING THE SELF,"How do we represent the self? This comparative course explores different visual modes for representing the self in autobiographical writing. We will look at how authors visually represent themselves in autobiographies that include photographs, graphic memoirs, and autobiographical films to investigate questions about self-creation, referentiality, and the tension between fact and fiction inherent in any autobiographical project. Throughout the course we will focus on the relationship between word and image,the trope of the photograph album and the attempt to understand the self in relation to the family, and the use of images to imagine or invent the past. Themes of memory, imagination, fantasy, nostalgia, trauma, and loss will demand our attention, and we will chart how these concerns transform across the different media. We will explore these themes across a range of materials, including: texts by Vladimir Mayakovsky, Vladimir Nabokov, Roland Barthes, Gary Shteyngart, Alison Bechdel, Nina Bunjevac, and Art Spiegelman; films by Andrei Tarkovsky, Federico Fellini, Dominique Cabrera, and Jean-Luc Godard; and theoretical texts by Philippe Lejeune, Paul de Man,André Bazin,and Susan Sontag.

The Indigenous Studies Summer Program is a two-week summer program at Columbia University. Researchers, professionals, practitioners, and advanced students from around the world will gather at CSER to participate in this intensive summer immersion program at Columbia University on indigenous peoples' rights and policy. The program runs from May 31-June 11, 2016. The program provides an overview and analysis of the major questions in indigenous affairs today as they have emerged globally in the last decades, culminating with the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The course will analyze the interaction between the Indigenous movement-one of the strongest social movements of our times-and the intergovernmental system over the past 50 years, paying close attention to its questioning of and impact on international norms, institutions and major global debates. The program will use an interdisciplinary approach, and discussion will be presented under the lens of human rights studies, international law, political science, Indigenous studies, ethnic studies, development studies, sociology and anthropology. The course incorporates lectures and workshops on the most recent and innovative academic and other research and policy debates on indigenous peoples issues. It is complemented by visits to the United Nations and a Native American Nation, lectures and discussions with United Nations officials, officials of a Native American Nation and representatives of Indigenous organizations. Please note that there will be a $500 fee to cover the cost of meals during class (Breakfast and Lunch) travel, and lodging in to Akwesasne (upstate NY).",Elsa Stamatopoulou,9:00am,5:00pm,67346,Morningside,S5060-20162-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623154713/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CSER/S5060-20162-001/,511 Hamilton Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

In examining the cross currents between literary and juridical regimes, we will critique the social, affective, and legal mechanisms which elaborately deformed conceptual categories such as ""citizenship"" or ""personhood"" in the antebellum era; we will also consider the ways in which such mechanisms still withhold basic rights from African Americans. Students will address questions such as: which representational strategies do law and fiction share? Why are legal documents such powerfully attractive sources in antebellum literary production? In which ways are fictions of property, kinship, citizenship, temporality, and the natural world translated into legal thought? And how do the legacies, fictionalisms, and dead ends of antebellum jurisprudence manifest today? In addition to literary texts, we will analyze court cases, legal codes, police reports, antebellum print culture, political philosophy, and contemporary criticism.

ENGL S3261,ENGLISH LITERATURE TO 1500,"Geoffrey Chaucer never came to New York. He died in 1400 and it would be over two hundred years before anything resembling modern day New York was built here. To be in this city is to be divided - geographically, temporally and culturally - from fourteenth century England. Every trace of the medieval in New York, from the crowd-pleasing pageantry of Medieval Times to the extraordinary medieval palimpsest of the Cloisters, is in some sense ‘inauthentic’. What, then, could New York possibly have to teach us about Chaucer? This course will explore the ways that New York and its ‘inauthentic’ medievalisms are, in fact, wonderful tools for studying Chaucer’s work. Our classes will be built around an overview of Chaucer’s whole poetic career, from the earliest dream visions through to the ‘Retraction’ that closes the Canterbury Tales. We will read two of Chaucer’s dream visions (Book of the Duchess and House of Fame), a selection of the Canterbury Tales and some of Chaucer’s shorter poems. As we prepare for each class you will be encouraged to visit various ‘medieval’ sites around New York and think about how these senses of ‘inauthenticity’ - of the superimposition of the old and the new, of recreated forms and gestures of a distant past, of copying, assembling, remaking - can bring us closer to some of the primary forces driving Chaucer’s poetic production.",Aled W Roberts,1:00pm,4:10pm,18478,Morningside,S3261-20162-001,CHAUCER IN NEW YORK,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/13061,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160802005238/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3261-20162-001/,507 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

As work in this period shows, the ubiquity of rap music in popular culture had a measurable influence in the poetry being produced at the time.

Through fiction, poetry, essays, and artwork, we will consider the movement within the context of American modernism and African American cultural history, focusing on the relationship or tension between art/literature and socio-political change.

ENGL S4401,18TH CENTURY & ROMANTIC POETRY,"This course is a study of romantic poetry and poetics but does not approach its subject from the belated perspective of the Victorians or the Moderns. Instead, the famous Romantics of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are viewed proleptically, from the vantage point of early and mid 18th-century poets who established the modern criteria and generated the forms and ideas later ingeniously personalized by the poets we customarily refer to as the Romantics. Indeed, though we shall spend the concluding half of our study with Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats, our study begins with the neoclassical romanticism of Pope, Thomson, Akenside, the Wartons, Gray, and Goldsmith. As such, our reading entails a study of lyric trends bridging 18th - and 19th - century verse and of related discourses in aesthetic psychology, moral philosophy, experimental religion, natural description, and affective criticism. We shall attend closely to rhetorical and prosodic elements, with a view to characteristic genres (ode, epistle, georgic, epitaph), innovative hybrids and new forms (elegy, the ""conversational"" poem). Recommended and required readings in prose are of the period and include theoretical and critical writings by our poets.",Marianne Giordani,1:00pm,4:10pm,68299,Morningside,S4401-20162-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/3085,silver,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623170127/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S4401-20162-001/,612 Philosophy Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S4452,EXPRESSIVE ARTS OF NYC,"Why do we still laugh at comic works from nearly 2500 years ago, comedies that have outlived their generations? An examination of the different forms of staged comedy throughout the centuries, beginning with foundational texts from Ancient Greece, especially Aristophanes. We consider how today's playwrights are still building on, and making reference to, primary works from the Western canon. Texts we will read range from Shakespeare, Jonson and Restoration comedies, to Wilde, Beckett, Hansberry, Tennessee Williams, Pinter, and Churchill. We will also cover contemporary work seen on the stages of New York, including short comic plays, stand up, and physical comedy. Attention will be given to comic characters, comic pretense, wit, humor, comedy of errors, comic gestures, comic archetypes, farce, cross-dressing, satiric comedy, comic relief, tragicomedy, romantic comedy, and theatre of the absurd. This course will be of special interest to serious students of comedy.

ENGL S4526,COMIC BOOKS/GRAPHIC NOVELS-LIT,"In his 1924 book, The Seven Lively Arts, cultural critic Gilbert Seldes wrote, ""With those who hold that a comic strip cannot be a work of art I shall not traffic."" This course will take a prolonged look at this form of art in order to trace the history of comics and graphic novels in America. Focusing on representative texts that define and redefine the medium, we will learn how to approach comics as a distinct literary and visual form, while familiarizing ourselves with the critical vocabulary of ""sequential art."" By examining the graphic novel with an eye toward the literary, the course will explore a variety of genres and the ways they deploy conventional literary forms such as allegory, epic, character, setting, symbolism, and metaphor. We will consider how comics resist, represent, and entrench dominant cultural ideologies about power, myth, heroism, humor, adolescence, gender, sexuality, family, poverty, religion, censorship, and the immigrant experience. The course will provide students with the critical tools to read this key vehicle of contemporary creative expression. Readings will include seminal works and newer classics, by Gaiman, Bell, Miller, Moore, Crumb, Bell, Spiegelman, Ware, Derf, and shorter pieces by many others. In addition, we will read selections from texts on graphic narrative theory and comics history, beginning with Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics.",Karen L Green,5:30pm,8:40pm,16046,Morningside,S4526-20162-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/6086,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623170156/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S4526-20162-001/,302 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

International Students are not eligible for this course, as it does not provide academic credit. The Television Writing Intensive is a six week, concentrated and encompassing introduction into the field of television writing, designed to prepare students for the professional worlds of sit-coms, one-hour dramas and police / medical procedurals. In an interconnected program consisting of two intensive writing workshops and a lecture series with guest writers and professionals in the field, students gain the knowledge and authority to explore, examine and create the kind of groundbreaking work that is taking over cable and making its way onto the Networks, here and around the world. The Television Writing Intensive focuses on two specific tracks. One track is the half-hour comedy; the other is the one-hour drama. These two formats, although having much in common, come out of different traditions and are conceived and written in different ways. * This intensive course will meet 15 hours per week, on Mondays and Tuesdays for six hours during the day (exact times TBD), and Thursday evenings for three hours (exact time TBD). These times are probable but subject to change based on availability of guest speakers and other opportunities which may arise, but the general format will stay the same if changes do occur.  Meaning, the course will meet for two week days for six hours and one week night for three hours, avoiding Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.",Alan Kingsberg,6:00pm,8:00pm,16546,Morningside,S0431-20162-001,,Film,FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623152118/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/S0431-20162-001/,511 Dodge Hall,,Summer Session,0,,R,20162FILM0431S001,WORKSHOP

The course examines not only French dancers and choreographers, but also French conceptions of the expressive body seen in other urban art forms. We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City. When possible, we will attend modern dance performances, and productions of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet. As well, we will visit New York City museums and gallery exhibits, and allied cultural events that help to illustrate the lyric French style. The course will be conducted in English.

HIST S3014,GREECE IN THE 5TH CENT BCE,"This lecture course focuses on what is generally considered the zenith century of ancient Greek civilization and culture, the era when the Greeks were at their peak of cultural and political innovation and productivity. In literature, the arts, philosophy, and medicine as well as politics, the Greeks of the 5th century, the height of the so-called Classical Age of Greece, produced ideas, innovations, and works that still continue to delight, inform, and influence western culture especially, but people throughout the world more broadly. This is the century in which, under the leadership of those two polar opposites Sparta and Athens, the southern Greeks defeated a vast invading force of the mighty Persian Empire, and in the flush of that unexpected victory they unleashed a burst of creativity with few if any parallels in world history. The focuses of Greek political life in this century were of course Athens and Sparta, and the center of Greek cultural and economic developments was Athens, so the course will necessarily focus extensively on those two states, especially on Athens, but the rest of Greece will be covered too. We shall be examining political, social, cultural, philosophical, and economic developments in our attempt to understand the life of Greece at this time, and its unique contributions to world history.",Richard A Billows,1:00pm,4:10pm,76811,Morningside,S3014-20162-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/20,silver,35.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Billows,https://web.archive.org///web/20160925183507/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3014-20162-001/,302 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

The course sets out to highlight the impact of nomadic political cultures on shaping the operation of Russian imperial policies and practices and their legacies, a perspective that is typically not represented in Eurasian and Russian history courses as a major idea of analysis. The course's focus therefore will be on the spread of Russian rule over Eurasia's steppe regions and Turkestan. Among other things, the course explores how the interplay of the nomadic concepts of sovereignty and tenitoriality enabled the rise of the Russian empire. Beyond ethnic and cultural history special attention will be devoted to economic and militaty history, as well as political institutions and diplomacy. We will also look at the ways in which the concept of Eurasia continued to inspire Soviet and post-Soviet politicians and other related groups to construct and reconstruct boundaries between East and West.",Gulnar T Kendirbai,9:00am,12:10pm,93631,Morningside,S3225-20162-001,"ASIATIC RUSS:EMPIRE,STATE&SOCI;",History,HIST,http://localhost:8801/professors/2974,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160810001513/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3225-20162-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST S4779,AFRICA AND FRANCE,"This course endeavors to understand the development of the peculiar and historically conflictual relationship that exists between France, the nation-states that are its former African colonies, and other contemporary African states. It covers the period from the 19th century colonial expansion through the current 'memory wars' in French politics and debates over migration and colonial history in Africa. Historical episodes include French participation in and eventual withdrawal from the Atlantic Slave Trade, emancipation in the French possessions, colonial conquest, African participation in the world wars, the wars of decolonization, and French-African relations in the contexts of immigration and the construction of the European Union. Readings will be drawn extensively from primary accounts by African and French intellectuals, dissidents, and colonial administrators. However, the course offers neither a collective biography of the compelling intellectuals who have emerged from this relationship nor a survey of French-African literary or cultural production nor a course in international relations. Indeed, the course avoids the common emphasis in francophone studies on literary production and the experiences of elites and the common focus of international relations on states and bureaucrats. The focus throughout the course is on the historical development of fields of political possibility and the emphasis is on sub-Saharan Africa.",Gregory Mann,1:00pm,4:10pm,75595,Morningside,S4779-20162-001,,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/931,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160622161922/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S4779-20162-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

What role do human rights play in coordinating the different interests that drive global economic governance? This seminar will introduce students to different structures of global governance for development, trade, labor, finance, the environment, migration, and intellectual property and investigate their relationship with human rights. Students will learn about public, private, and mixed forms of governance, analyze the ethical and strategic perspectives of the various stakeholders and relate them to existing human rights norms.

HRTS S4190,HUMAN RIGHTS & VISUAL CULTURE,"This course examines the relationship between visual culture and human rights. It considers a wide range of visual media (photography, painting, sculpture), as well as aspects of visuality (surveillance, profiling). We will use case studies ranging in time from the early modern period (practices in which the body was marked to measure criminality, for example), to the present day. Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images. Subjects to be addressed include: the nature of evidence; documentation and witness; censorship; iconoclasm; surveillance; profiling; advocacy images; signs on the body; visibility and invisibility.",Susan M Merriam,1:00pm,4:10pm,18513,Morningside,S4190-20162-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623145638/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4190-20162-001/,318 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

The movement strengthens, and is strengthened by, a complex web of institutions, laws, and norms that constitute a functioning global system that builds on itself progressively, animated by strong NGOs. The course will address the evolution of the international human rights movement and on the NGOs that drive the movement on the international, regional and domestic levels. Sessions will highlight the experiences of major human rights NGOs and will address topics including strategy development, institutional representation, research methodologies, partnerships, networks, venues of engagement, campaigning, fundraising and, perhaps most importantly, the fraught and complex debates about adaptation to changing global circumstances.",Louis Bickford,5:30pm,8:40pm,69550,Morningside,S4215-20162-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,http://culpa.info/professors/11792,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160804040614/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4215-20162-001/,306 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

Its focus will be on the systemic nature of recent crises, scrutinizing both their root causes and the challenges faced by the myriad of international, regional, national and local actors seeking to respond to them. The readings will draw both on the academic and the policy literature, emphasizing how a human rights perspective contributes to our understanding the fundamental challenges that lie ahead. The course will critically examine how the field of forced migration studies has evolved in recent years to reflect these new conditions. It will look at the theoretical arguments for accepting refugees from a rights perspective and show how these understandings have been embedded in international laws, norms and structures. It will survey how national governments have developed responses intended to meet these obligations as they also weigh national security and electoral concerns in the development of their policies. The empirical focus will be on the Middle East and the recent Syrian and Iraqi crises, looking at how a range of actors, primarily based in Europe and in the region itself, are responding to the greatest refugee and IDP crisis since the end of World War II. The course will conclude with an examination of local issues, as this is where the tensions are often most sharply experienced.",Ted Perlmutter,5:30pm,8:40pm,61247,Morningside,S4230-20162-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160825193259/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4230-20162-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

We assess a wide variety of terrorist organizations, and explore the psychological, socioeconomic, political, and religious causes of terrorist violence past and present. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various counterterrorism strategies, from the point of view of efficacy as well as ethics, and look into ways in which the new threat of global terrorism might impact the healthy functioning of democratic states. The course is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on the terrorist threat, including the nature, roots, objectives, tactics, and organization of terrorism and terrorist groups. Part II addresses the issue of counterterrorism, including recent American efforts to combat terrorism, the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools and instruments, the issue of civil liberties and democratic values in confronting terrorism, and international strategies and tactics.",Stuart M Gottlieb,2:00pm,5:10pm,75665,Morningside,S6387-20162-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,http://localhost:8801/professors/2219,silver,12.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160821233852/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6387-20162-001/,407 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

INAF S6554,UN & THE CHAL OF PEACE,"It is now a well known fact that countries embroiled in conflict seldom emerge from it ""once and for all."" They tend to relapse back into conflict within months or years. The reasons are also well-known: low education and high poverty levels, weak or non- existent institutions, poor governance, exclusion and marginalization of certain groups including women and poor economic prospects certainly in livelihoods. And yet Peace building in the international context is a relatively new concept. It appeared in the in the UN lexicon in the 1980s and has evolved as a normative concept since. Peace building is complex and multi-faceted encompassing security, human rights, development and reconciliation of past differences and ultimately societal transformation. It is before everything else a political exercise. This course will ask: How is Peace building done, who are the actors and stakeholders? What lessons have we learnt since the 1980s? What does it take to build the peace? The course will give an understanding of the evolution of the norm of peace building at the United Nations and discuss the new UN Peace building architecture. Ten years after its creation, has the Peace Building Commission made a difference and why? What have been its challenges? It will look at the many stakeholders on the ground and discuss the issue of coordination and the need for integrated strategies. It will provide examples of countries that have succeeded, analyze the root causes of the conflicts and the tools which were used. It will extract the lessons learned and the conditions for peace building to succeed.",,2:00pm,5:10pm,12034,Morningside,S6554-20162-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623145947/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6554-20162-001/,402B International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"This past year marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations (UN) and the year when a new Secretary-­‐General will be selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki Moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to -­‐ fewer but deadlier -­‐ armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate -­‐ armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Jeremy O Boutellis,2:00pm,5:10pm,71130,Morningside,S6559-20162-001,,International and Public Affairs,INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623145948/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6559-20162-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

MUSI S2400,MUSIC & INDIG EXP IN N.AM,"What is ""music"" for Native American communities? How is meaning in indigenous music/sound generated? What has the creation, performance, and experience of listening to indigenous or indigenously created musics done for both Native and Settler/Immigrant communities in America? In this course we will develop foundational skills for listening to and contextualizing the music of indigenous peoples, and we will explore what scholars, activists and other authors have said about indigenous musical practices and creativity. While this course is listening-intensive, it will also draw upon literature in musicology/ethnomusicology, Native American studies, anthropology, performance studies, philosophy, and especially the intellectual work of indigenous peoples themselves. We will also pay particular attention to indigenous music happening in and around New York City.",Trevor G Reed,9:00am,12:10pm,70731,Morningside,S2400-20162-001,,Music,MUSI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623155149/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MUSI/S2400-20162-001/,405 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

POLS S3133,ISSUES IN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY,"This course considers some fundamental puzzles about the nature of law. Legal philosophers, judges, academic lawyers, and political scientists give very different answers to the following key questions: What is law? What kind of question is ""what is law?""? Does law have a function and if so what is it? Is there a relationship between law and ideas of morality or social justice? Does law impose upon citizens an obligation to obey it and if so what is the nature of that obligation and how does it arise? Do we have an obligation to obey unjust laws? How should we interpret laws that are vague, ambiguous, or contradictory? How should judges in a democratic society decide legal disputes? How in fact do judges in our society decide legal disputes? Our goal is to wrestle with these problems and, with some luck, form our own ideas about whether and how they might be resolved. We will consider a variety of recent contributions from within legal, political, and moral philosophy, sociology, judicial political science, economics, the philosophy of language, and ,even literary interpretation. Our focus will be on the most important scholarly contributions in Anglophone legal philosophy, along with several landmark American court cases which raise important theoretical questions.",Luke S Macinnis,6:15pm,9:25pm,72328,Morningside,S3133-20162-001,,Political Science,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/11978,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623161235/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/S3133-20162-001/,306 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

POLS S3520,POLITICS OF RIGHTS,"Why would powerful states with expansive capabilities for surveilling, controlling, and subjugating their citizens ever recognize or respect individual rights? Is it within a state's interest to limit its own power to obtain greater longer-term growth and stability? Can interest groups and minorities successfully organize to win new or to strengthen existing rights protections? Does the international human rights movement have any impact on the development and respect for human rights at the domestic level? This seminar course engages with these and related questions by examining political science and legal theory regarding the nature of rights and the conditions under which states will respect (or abuse) rights. The granting of a right creates an inherent tension within any political system. As a commitment to limit the exercise of state powers or invest resources to the benefit of individuals, respecting rights necessarily reduces the discretion and range of action of political leaders. This course seeks to understand why and under what conditions a state will accept limitations on power and grant individual rights. We will examine different theories from the fields of comparative politics, political economy, and legal academia that provide explanations regarding the incentives for leaders to grant property rights, the ability of interest groups and social movements to push for the recognition of rights, and the significance of the ""legal""recognition of a right in written law. The course will also include a segment examining the contribution of international human rights to the emergence of domestic rights struggles and the recognition of rights internally within states. We will focus primarily on contemporary authors and examples of rights-based movements in this course, and attempt to bring in opposing viewpoints that highlight both normative and empirical debates within the literature.",Jacob N Kopas,9:00am,12:10pm,60817,Morningside,S3520-20162-001,,Political Science,POLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160723110919/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/S3520-20162-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

What is innovation? How does it emerge and diffuse? How might organizations support or hinder the development of novel ideas? What role does technology play in the pursuit of innovation? We will apply a critical lens to the organization of innovation, recognizing that innovation-although a popular buzzword in the business world-implies a variety of outcomes that may solve previously intractable problems on the one hand, but may have unintended social consequences on the other. The goals of the course are to provide students with a broad overview of the existing literature on the sociology of innovation at both the macro- and micro-level and to support students in future careers in management, engineering, academia, or any field that involves the organization of groups of individuals toward creative ends.",Sarah E Sachs,10:45am,12:20pm,64651,Morningside,S3675-20162-001,,Sociology,SOCI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623165330/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/S3675-20162-001/,C01 Knox Hall,,"Barnard

SUMA K4360,SUST TECH & EVOLUTION OF SMART CITIES,"The progress of sustainability in recent years has almost entirely been a result in the evolution of smart, sustainable technology solutions. This course examines opportunities to drive sustainability through technology applications with the end goal of piecing together all of the pieces to envision an intelligent city. Companies are increasingly turning to technology to fulfill their sustainability goals considering many technologies provide off-the-shelf, cost-effective and immediate savings compared to operationally invasive, resource-heavy sustainability transformation programs. Sustainability technology ranges from intelligent infrastructure to mobile applications that help to drive the ""sharing economy"". The course will provide an overview of the sustainability technologies that large corporations are actively pursuing and delve into the project management and integration strategies required to implement these solutions. Successful sustainability practitioners must not only have a strong understanding of the values and methodologies of sustainable operations, but also the tools and technologies available to drive sustainability throughout their organization. Upon completion of the class, students will have a sufficient level of understanding to discuss these solutions and relevant case studies with potential employers. This course will benefit anyone interested in a career in sustainability or in smart cities as it will provide them the skills and analytical capabilities to analyze which sustainability technologies are a good fit for their company's sustainability and growth strategy.",Gregory J Falco,6:10pm,8:00pm,96246,Morningside,K4360-20162-001,EVOLUTION OF SMART CITIES,School of Professional Studies,SUMA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161226013720/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SUMA/K4360-20162-001/,517 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

The form offers the writer the chance to hone in on and focus on their craft, by paying close attention to detail, language, character, voice and tone, while also creating work that is immediate, urgent and often extraordinarily innovative. Students will write and discuss short pieces that may be fragments, moments or lists, surreal or dreamlike, traditional or experimental, but are always, as the author Jayne Anne Phillips says, ""Fast, precise, over. And not over. The one-page fiction should hang in the air of the mind like an image made of smoke."" This course is primarily a workshop, so students will write 3-4 pieces (in and out of class), and we'll also read and discuss short pieces by Samuel Beckett, Jorge Luis Borges, Mavis Gallant, Dave Eggers, Christine Schutt, Jamaica Kincaid, Michael Ondaatje, and Lydia Davis.",Rebecca Godfrey,2:00pm,4:10pm,17297,Morningside,S4308-20162-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623152132/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4308-20162-001/,409 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4312,REIMAGINING EKPHRASIS,"At least since the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos called ""painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks,"" poetry has existed in conversation with a variety of other art forms, particularly visual art. In this class we will explore poetry as an interdisciplinary practice, with an emphasis on the work of artists who create in both the visual and textual fields. Among other key critical questions, we will consider: 1. How has an intersection with visual art been important to poetry historically? 2. How does visual experience relate to particular aspects of poetry writing? 3. How can we use visual art towards our own creative process in the future, either by using visual art in writing poetry or by incorporating illustration in the presentation of our written work? A mix of texts-classic and contemporary poetry, illuminated manuscripts, children's picturebooks, literature that we might consider visually-driven, and related scholarship­­-form the basis for our investigations, discussions, and creative work. Among these texts we will consider work by Etel Adnan, John Ashbery, William Blake, Tisa Bryant, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Robert Duncan, Susan Howe, Douglas Kearney, Ezra Jack Keats, Tan Lin, Fred Moten, Maggie Nelson, Frank O'Hara, Adam Pendleton, Maurice Sendak, Cecilia Vicuña and Hannah Weiner. Our class will function as part seminar and part workshop. We will spending half of the class discussing texts and issues surrounding the course's theme, completing in-class writing exercises, and the other half giving each other feedback on creative work.

Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure.

WRIT S4320,TRAVEL WRITING,"How does the traveler become the travel writer?  What makes good travel writing? Why does it matter today? This course examines and breaks down the very specific craft of travel writing. Simply because we like to travel, does it qualify us to write about it? Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about… Paris, or even Patagonia?   In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal— it’s in the personal that the universal is revealed.   From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong “nut graph,” to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into “the field” (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, “I went here, I did this, I ate that.” From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",Porter T Fox,6:15pm,8:25pm,74467,Morningside,S4320-20162-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160623152136/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4320-20162-001/,407 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4323,WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL,"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of ""new adult"" or ""crossover"" fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",Carley Moore,10:00am,12:10pm,62946,Morningside,S4323-20162-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20160923083816/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4323-20162-001/,407 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

WRIT S4810,HOW TO WRITE FUNNY,"In this class we will consider the various forms and functions of humor in written prose, discussing techniques and approaches to humor writing. Students will write their own humorous stories and essays which we will read and discuss in class, focusing not only on what is or isn't funny, but on how humor can be advantageously used to increase the power of an overall piece. The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",Adam Z Wilson,2:00pm,4:10pm,93096,Morningside,S4810-20162-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20161007114200/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/S4810-20162-001/,407 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard
