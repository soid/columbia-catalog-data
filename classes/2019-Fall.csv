AFAS UN1001,INTRO TO AFRICAN-AMER STUDIES,"Prerequisites: Students need to register for a section of AFAS UN1010, the required discussion section for this course. 
 From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this “New World” democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S., but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the “middle passage” to the present so-called “post-racial” moment—drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature—to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e., agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e., migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e., uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e., Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.). By the end of the semester, students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of major themes/figures/traditions, alongside a range of cultural/political practices and institutional arrangements, in African-American Studies.",Josef Sorett,10:10am,12:00pm,10574,Morningside,UN1001-20193-001,,African American and African Diaspora,AFAS,http://culpa.info/professors/9341,silver,3.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Sorett,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529113652/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AFAS/UN1001-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

forestiero
 in a city such as Renaissance Venice where, as Philippe de Commynes wrote, “
la plupart de leur peuple est estranger” – 
most of the people are foreigners? Sansovino himself was a second-generation immigrant from Central Italy. This seminar will explore the figure of the foreign artist in Renaissance Venice, analyzing short and long journeys—undertaken, for example, by Antonello da Messina, Albrecht Dürer, and El Greco—as well as permanent relocations, such as in the case of Pietro Lombardo, Andrea Schiavone, and L’Aliense. Taking into consideration the specific status of strangers defined by the laws of the Republic of Venice, the social structures of assistance for foreign communities, as well as the organization of workshops and trade, this seminar will investigate the contribution of foreign artists to the artistic production in Renaissance Venice and to the elaboration of the

In all of Deleuze's work there is a search for a new 'image of thought.' But how did art figure in this search, and how did the search in turn appeal to artists, writers, filmmakers, architects, as well as curators or critics? In this seminar, we explore the complex theme of 'thinkin in art' in Deleuze, and its implications for art in the 21st century or for the global contemporary art of today.",John Rajchman,2:10pm,4:00pm,41652,Morningside,GU4546-20193-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rajchman,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125801/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GU4546-20193-001/,832 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Students will be introduced to major artists, works, and media, as well as to key themes in the art historical scholarship. Topics will include: the birth of art criticism; the development of the art market; domesticity and the cult of sensibility; the ascension of women artists and patrons; and the visual culture of empire, slavery, and revolution.

AHIS UN2427,Twentieth-Century Architecture,"This course examines some of the key moments of architectural modernity in the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how architecture participated in the making of a new world order. It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts.

AHIS UN3100,"Hellenistic Sculpture: Intellectuals, Go","Obsession with the Classical often kept us from looking at the Hellenistic period with its artistic achievements as a time of innovation and\ experimentation in art. In Hellenistic times, new cultural and artistic centers arose besides Athens: Alexandria in Egypt, Antiocheia and Pergamon in Asia Minor, or Rhodes. Especially in sculpture, artists and patrons demonstrated an unprecedented interest in subjects such as ugly old women, working peasants, slaves with disfigured bodies, or non-Greeks. The seminar will study the sculpture of the Hellenistic period as an extremely imaginative and dynamic artistic expression without the Classical bias. In addition, it will look into the societal conditions that allowed this multi-cultural and rather inclusive style in sculpture to be created. The styles of the various Hellenistic artistic centers will be individually analysed based on representative works and then compared to each other and to the sculptural traditions of the Classical period, so that Hellenistic sculpture can be understood both as a continuation of the Classical and especially Late Classical sculpture and as an artistic, intellectual, and social creation – a creation that often went against the ideals of the past.",Ioannis Mylonopoulos,4:10pm,6:00pm,41657,Morningside,UN3100-20193-001,HELLENISTIC SCULPTURE,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/3549,silver,13.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125720/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/UN3100-20193-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Drawing on a range of perspectives—including those drawn from postcolonial studies, critical race studies, and indigenous studies—we will develop a critical vocabulary for addressing the history of colonialism and the ongoing process of decolonization, asking what particular problems and opportunities art history presents for the study of empire. In what ways were aesthetics entangled with imperial ideology? How did works of art support or challenge dominant political, social, and cultural narratives? And what does a study of historic empires have to offer to our understanding of globalization today? We will also engage with the ways in which the legacy of empire is treated in contemporary museology, and will visit a number of New York City museums and collections throughout the semester. Regions covered include India, the Caribbean, the Pacific, and North Africa; topics include cartographic practices, the recording of history, the visual culture of slavery, artifacts of exploration, photography and “truth,” and the materiality of color.",,10:10am,12:00pm,41659,Morningside,UN3450-20193-001,ART AND EMPIRE,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125726/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/UN3450-20193-001/,832 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,,4,,T,20193AHIS3450W001,SEMINAR

ANHS GU4001,THE ANCIENT EMPIRES,"The principal goal of this course is to examine the nature and histories of a range of early empires in a comparative context. In the process, we will examine influential theories that have been proposed to account for the emergence and trajectories of those empires. Among the theories are the core-periphery, world-systems, territorial-hegemonic, tributary-capitalist, network, and IEMP approaches.  Five regions of the world have been chosen, from the many that could provide candidates: , Rome (the classic empire), New Kingdom Egypt, Qin China, Aztec Mesoamerica, and Inka South America. These empires have been chosen because they represent a cross-section of polities ranging from relatively simple and early expansionist societies to the grand empires of the Classical World, and the most powerful states of the indigenous Americas. , There are no prerequisites for this course, although students who have no background in Anthropology, Archaeology, History, or Classics may find the course material somewhat more challenging than students with some knowledge of the study of early societies.  There will be two lectures per week, given by the professor.",Terence N D'Altroy,11:40am,12:55pm,45273,Morningside,GU4001-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANHS,http://culpa.info/professors/9,,37.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529120411/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANHS/GU4001-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

At the same time, people working in museums make decisions with ethical and legal issues regularly and seldom give these judgments even little thought. In part, this is due to the fact that many of these decisions are based upon values that become second nature. This course will explore ethical issues that arise in all areas of a museum's operations from governance and management to collections acquisition, conservation, and deaccessioning. We will examine the issues that arise when the ownership of objects in a museum's are questioned; the ethical considerations involved in retention, restitution and repatriation; and what decolonization means for museums.",Sally Yerkovich,2:10pm,4:00pm,45126,Morningside,GR5361-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115900/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GR5361-20193-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ANTH GR6070,MAKING ETHNOG:METHOD & WRITING,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 This course offers a hands-on introduction to key methods of ethnographic fieldwork while exploring both practical and critical questions raised by the production of ethnographic knowledge. Students will become familiar with the diverse techniques collected under the heading of ‘ethnographic research' and will put these into action through a series of mini-research assignments. These assignments-and the successes, failures, surprises, disappointments and dilemmas students encounter in carrying them out-also provide the raw material through which we consider the epistemological and ethical possibilities and limits of ethnographic knowledge. Thus we take up ethnographic fieldwork and writing as situated practices with powerful histories, rather than as neutral methodological tools. Readings include examples of various kinds of ethnographic text (including images) and critical reflections on ethnography itself. Mini research assignments comprise a scaled-down dry run of ethnography making, giving students practice at preparing research proposals, conducting field observation and interviews, and turning these into contextualized ethnographic texts.",,,,45244,Morningside,GR6070-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115904/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GR6070-20193-001/,,Classroom,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

We will likewise address vicarious forms of personhood through the prosthetic, the avatar or the anonymous. But we will also look into forms of dissipation of personhood and unreliable agency where subjects become more like a medium through which to think rhythms and ongoing infrastructures of the living.

Third, we will critically examine the assumed relationship between European social theory and the lived experiences of people living in indigenous worlds and the global south.

ANTH GR6294,POLITICAL CONCEPTS IN WAKE OF GEONTONTOP,"It’s hot and it’s getting hotter. As the machinery of capital extraction, industrialism, and consumption refuses to relinquish its grip, meteorological temperatures continue to rise and chemical hot zones spread. Tipping points threaten regime shifts in which the qualitative nature of the earth’s biosphere will alter. But until then, and even after then, hot zones occur in the aggregate only in abstraction. In reality they form like weather clouds over specific places—toxic smog over Beijing, lead poisoning in drinking water in Flint, Michigan, uranium exposure in Navajo and Hopi lands. Marx thought the social dialectic was leading to the purification of the fundamental opposition of human classes. No little evidence can be mustered to support the claim that we are nearing this moment—the world seems to be splitting into ever more extreme halves—the one percent and the ever-increasing precariate. But what many believe we are witnessing a new form of antagonism and which demands new modes of solidarity. The new swelter seems to them less fundamentally a war of class—although also a class war, although definitely not a clash of civilization—and more a clash of existents. And in this new war of the world everyone must decide with whom (or what) we are making ties of solidarity.

ANTH GR6355,The Limits of Liberalism,"This graduate seminar will explore different angles of criticism of the various ideas and doctrines that have accumulated over the last three centuries under the omnibus label ‘liberalism’. Its approach will be part intellectual history and part analytical.  One question that will inform our inquiry is whether these criticisms should be seen as dissenting positions within the political Enlightenment, wrestling with a dominant ‘liberal’ tradition within it, or whether their logic leads to a more radical refusal of the entire framework of Enlightenment modernity. Though most of the readings are works of theory, a serious attempt will be made to situate theoretical themes in the political and cultural contexts of particular parts of the world, both in the past and the present.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,10353,Morningside,GR6355-20193-001,THE LIMITS OF LIBERALISM,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115939/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GR6355-20193-001/,716 Philosophy Hall,,,3,,M,20193ANTH6355G001,SEMINAR

ANTH GR6601,QUESTIONS-ANTHROP THRY I:TEXTS,"Presents students with critical theories of society, paying particular attention to classic continental social theory of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will trace a trajectory through important French and German writings essential for any understanding of the modern discipline of anthropology: from Saussure through Durkheim and Mauss, Marx, Weber, and on to the structuralist elaboration of these theoretical perspectives in Claude Lévi-Strauss, always bearing in mind the relationship of these theories to contemporary anthropology. We come last to Foucault and affiliated theorists as successors both to French structuralism and to German social theory and its concerns with modernity, rationality, and power. Throughout the readings, we will give special care to questions of signification as they inform anthropological inquiry, and we will be alert to the historical contexts that situate the discipline of anthropology today.",David Scott,10:10am,12:00pm,45158,Morningside,GR6601-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/2077,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115948/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GR6601-20193-001/,457 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

Each student will co-lead one discussion section during the term. During most classes there will be presentation and discussion of student assignments.
In this course we will learn how to digitally map and visualize museum systems and use this knowledge to facilitate a visitors journey from thinking to making. In the first part of the semester readings, class discussion and weekly “experiments” will be used to investigate how mapping, sketching, and modeling techniques can help develop sustainable frameworks for exhibition. In the second part of the semester we will begin modeling solutions and use these models to refine the way we communicate them to various stakeholders and audiences. Ultimately, the course aims to help students clearly articulate their thinking, explore ways of planning and communicating solutions and develop new models of engagement and action in an exhibition context.

 How is the world in bodies? 
 Building from these deceptively simple questions, ours will be an interdisciplinary reading seminar on how bodies (mostly human, but sometimes nonhuman) are made and remade in and through their environments and via their relationships to the material world. Privileging 
porosity
 as a rubric, we consider the ever-permeable boundaries between bodies and the other beings (be they viral, chemical, microbial or otherwise) with which they become entangled. Alongside the monographs under study, we will tackle article-length engagements with theories of new feminist/queer materialisms, decolonial and critical science studies.

ANTH GU4118,SETTLER COLONIALISM IN N AMER,"This course examines the relationship between colonialism, settlement and anthropology and the specific ways in which these processes have been engaged in the broader literature and locally in North America. We aim to understand colonialism as a theory of political legitimacy, as a set of governmental practices and as a subject of inquiry. Thus we will re-imagine North America in light of the colonial project and its ?technologies of rule? such as education, law and policy that worked to transform Indigenous notions of gender, property and territory. Our case studies will dwell in several specific areas of inquiry, among them: the Indian Act in Canada and its transformations of gender relations, governance and property; the residential and boarding school systems in the US and Canada, the murdered and missing women in Juarez and Canada and the politics of allotment in the US. Although this course will be comparative in scope, it will be grounded heavily within the literature from Native North America.",Audra Simpson,4:10pm,6:00pm,45271,Morningside,GU4118-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/9411,silver,5.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audra_Simpson,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115843/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/GU4118-20193-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH UN2026,ON PRECARITY,"The topic of precarity is a growing field in the social sciences. The main purpose of this course is to explore the wide semantics and potentials of the term in relation to domains such as labour, law, ethics, technology, health, relationships, moods, shifts in opinion, in fashions or the durability of goods. Our interest in precarity is grounded in two interrelated key motives: the first addresses it as an object of study in its own right. Judging from recent unemployment rates of the industrialized west, the mass scale displacement of populations or the corrosion of security, there is enough reason to put precarity into context. Yet, we might also proceed by inquiring about its potentials as a methodology, one might even call it “a style of reasoning”.  Given how much history relies on causation, sequence and linearity how to relate to precarity as a temporal structure in light of the complexities of the present? How does such multilateral present redefines the very conception of that present, of the historical and the now? 
 We will be relating to precarity not just as a condition of existence but also as an infrastructure with which to think societies across space and time. The course will focus on narratives, practices and structures that problematize and displace prima facie logics of the either/or. Instead, we want to highlight conjoined operations of the both/and which are changing the very nature of how we think norms, time and episteme. Taking a clue from the proliferation of forms of precarity, the course will be organized around specific themes. Within each two-week section, the first sessions will be a lecture and the remaining will combine lecture and discussion of the assigned items. As a whole, the course aims to sensitize students to the complexities and conditioning possibilities involved in the process of knowledge-making and to provide students with tools to better structure and critically access the information they receive and generate.",Maria Jos de Abreu,4:10pm,5:25pm,45171,Morningside,UN2026-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115530/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/UN2026-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

Every day, in every place in this world, we are exposed to an unknown number of contaminants, including those in the places that we live, the air that we breathe, the foods that we eat, the water that we drink, the consumer products that we use, and in the social worlds that we navigate. While we are all exposed, the effects of these exposures are distributed in radically unequal patterns, and histories of racialization, coloniality, and gendered inequality are critical determinants of the risks to wellness that these toxic entanglements entail. Scientists use the term ""body burden"" to describe the accumulated, enduring amounts of harmful substances present in human bodies. In this course, we explore the global conditions that give rise to local body burdens, plumbing the history of toxicity as a category, the politics of toxic exposures, and the experience of toxic embodiment. Foregrounding uneven exposures and disproportionate effects, we ask how scientists and humanists, poets and political activists, have understood toxicity as a material and social phenomenon. We will turn our collective attention to the analysis of ethnographies, memoirs, maps, film, and photography, and students will also be charged with creating visual and narrative projects for representing body burden of their own.",Vanessa L Agard-Jones,12:10pm,2:00pm,45266,Morningside,UN3811-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://localhost:8801/professors/13665,,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115553/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/UN3811-20193-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

As multiple publics become increasingly aware of the extensive and accelerated rate of current global environmental change, and the presence of anthropogenesis in ever expanding circumstances, we need to critically analyze the categories of thought and action being developed in order to carefully approach this change. Our concern is thus not so much the Anthropocene as an immutable fact, inevitable event, or definitive period of time (significant though these are), but rather for the political, social, and intellectual consequences of this important idea. Thus we seek to understand the creativity of ""The Anthropocene"" as a political, rhetorical, and social category.

ANTH UN3999,SENIOR THESIS SEM IN ANTHROPOL,"Prerequisites: The instructor's permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. 
 This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages).,  The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements.,  In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis/ capstone project.,  Note: The senior thesis seminar",Lila Abu-Lughod,2:10pm,4:00pm,45124,Morningside,UN3999-20193-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/1649,,16.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila_Abu-Lughod,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115838/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/UN3999-20193-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Columbia College

Dong Son
.  We then turn towards the introduction of high sinitic culture, and the region's long membership within successive Chinese empires.  We pay special attention to the rise of an independent state out of the crumbling Tang Dynasty, and the specific nation-building effects of war with the Mongols and the Ming Dynasty, in the 14th and 15th centuries respectively.  Our class ends with the French colonization of the region, and the dramatic cultural and intellectual transformations that were triggered as a result.  Our course will interrogate Vietnamese culture as a protean object, one that is defined and redefined at virtually every level, throughout a history marked by foreign interest, influence, and invasion.",John D Phan,2:40pm,3:55pm,44384,Morningside,UN1367-20193-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,ASCE,http://localhost:8801/professors/13523,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125952/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ASCE/UN1367-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

Then, the course considers how social intelligence skills fit the needs of managers at different stages of their careers. In early stages, managers need to achieve a good person-job fit, find mentors, and build an effective social network. At the mid-career stage, managers need to lead an effective unit with increasing complexity and responsibilities.

CGTH GU4100,Diaspora and Transnationalism: Critical,"The number of international migrants worldwide has continued to grow over the past decade, reaching 258 million in 2017, up from 248 million in 2015, and 220 million in 2010 (United Nations 2017). Poverty, war, and political exclusion are among the most significant reasons for the sharp rise in migration, though less distressing motivators, such as economic opportunity and family members abroad, continue to contribute to shifts in global demographics. This course examines one of the long-term outcomes of global demographic shifts – the establishment of transnational and diasporic communities throughout the world. While both the terms transnational community and diaspora remain open to scholarly debate, we will use them as broad heuristic devices to help us undertake a comparative analysis of minority communities living outside of idealized homelands from which they or their ancestors once departed. 
 To foster rich, focused thematic discussions, we will limit the scope of our examination to transnational and diasporic communities that were pushed to migrate by the most acute circumstances – poverty, war, and political exclusion, and that actively maintain strong collective identities predicated on connections to homeland (real or imagined). In the first section of the course, we will explore the theoretical and methodological issues underpinning recent scholarly literature on transnational migrations, nationalisms, and diasporas to develop understandings of the political and affective concepts of community and collective identity that will inform our discussions. In the second section of the course, we will examine case studies of specific transnational and diasporic communities, including Jews, Armenians, Palestinians, Africans, and Tamils. We will explore the political circumstances of the Jewish, Armenian, and African diasporas, as well as the ways that all three populations have defined the recent development of diaspora and transnational studies, becoming the standards against which scholars examine other migratory minority communities. Our examination of the less commonly studied Palestinian and Tamil diasporas will provide further comparative context to illuminate common themes of lived transnationalism, including loss, collective memory, and longing within host nations. Finally, the third section of the course will focus on the ways minority populations become diasporas and transnational communities through cultural productions, political claims, and the cultivation of inalienable connections to",Victoria G Gross,2:10pm,4:00pm,10316,Morningside,GU4100-20193-001,Diaspora and Transnationa,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529144644/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CGTH/GU4100-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20193CGTH4100W001,SEMINAR

 This course is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to modern synthetic chemistry via the selected series of topics (synthetic planning and the logic of organic assembly, classical and new reactions/methods and their use in complex target synthesis). Mechanistic underpinning of the discussed reaction processes will also be briefly discussed. For each module (see the content below), specific examples of syntheses of natural products and/or synthetic materials will be provided. In addition to lectures, students will select and present relevant papers in the class (the number of student symposia will depend on the final enrollment in this course). The basic knowledge of transition metal chemistry is recommended for the cross-coupling reactions (i.e., structure, electron counting, and elemental reaction types of transition metals).",Tomislav Rovis,10:10am,11:25am,99343,Morningside,GU4148-20193-001,,Chemistry,CHEM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529143326/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CHEM/GU4148-20193-001/,320 Havemeyer Hall,,"Barnard

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions. Overall, the course will serve as an exercise in historical methodology (with particular attention to ancient sources and to interpretation), an introduction to the geography and the history of the ancient world (classical and near-eastern), and the exploration of a complex testcase located at the contact point between several worlds, and at a watershed of world history.

CLCV UN3101,ARCHAEOL OF ANC EGYPT & NUBIA,"Thanks to the pyramids of Giza, the treasure of Tutankhamun, and other remains of royal activity, pharaonic Egypt is justly famous for its monuments and material culture. Equally fascinating, if less well known, however, are the towns, fortresses, cultic centers, domestic spaces, and non-elite cemeteries that have been excavated over the past 200 years or so. The archaeology of Nubia is also little known but fascinating on many levels. This course will focus on what archaeology can reveal about life as it was experienced by individuals of all social classes. Through a combination of broad surveys and case studies of some of Egypt and Nubia’s most culturally indicative and intriguing sites, we will explore issues such as the origins of inequality, state formation and its effects, the uneasy mix of state-planned settlements and village life, urbanism, domestic and community worship, gendered spaces, ethnicity and colonialism, religious revolution and evolution, bureaucracy, private enterprise, and the effects of governmental collapse on life and death in ancient Egypt and Nubia.",Ellen Morris,1:10pm,2:25pm,07554,Morningside,UN3101-20193-001,ARCHAEOL OF ANC EGYPT &,Classics @Barnard,CLCV,http://culpa.info/professors/5079,silver,9.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529144436/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLCV/UN3101-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

This course is an advanced survey of interdisciplinary formulations of performance studies. Students will examine a broad range of performances on and off the stage, live and recorded, including performance art, storytelling, celebrations, political speeches, concerts, protests, street happenings, and everyday encounters. We will read key texts in the field and apply them to various modes of performance and sites where we observe and participate in performance.

CLEN GU4015,VERNACULAR PALEOGRAPHY,"This class is designed to introduce graduate students (and some advanced undergraduates) to the paleography of English vernacular manuscripts written during the period ca. 700 -1500, with brief excursions into Latin and into French as it was written on the Continent. 
 The purpose of the course is fourfold: (1) to teach students how to make informed judgments with regard to the date (and sometimes place) of origin, (2) to provide instruction and practice in the accurate reading and transcription of medieval scripts, (3) to learn and use the basic vocabulary of the description of scripts, and (4) to examine the manuscript book as a product of the changing society that produced it and, thus, as a primary source for the study of that society and its culture. 
 In order to localize manuscripts in time and place, we also examine aspects of the written page besides the script, such as the material on which it is written, its layout and ruling, the decoration and illustration of the text, the provenance, and binding.   We also examine the process of manuscript production itself, whether institutional, commercial, or personal.  The history of book production and of decoration and illumination are thus considered part of the study of paleography, as is the history of patronage and that of libraries.  Manuscripts are among the most numerous and most reliable surviving witnesses to medieval social and intellectual change, and they will be examined as such. 
 To become proficient in the study of manuscripts it is necessary to look at manuscripts, as well as to read about them.  The more time you are able to spend looking at manuscripts critically, in the manuals and in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the greater will be your first-hand experience and hence your reliable knowledge.",Christopher C Baswell,10:10am,12:00pm,10008,Morningside,GU4015-20193-001,,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,http://culpa.info/professors/3980,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145203/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/GU4015-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

CLEN GU4739,World Poems,"This is a course on 20th- and 21st-century world poetry—poetry in dialogue with literature from other cultures, or poetry that reflects on experiences of coming into contact with other cultures. Our main focus will be long poems and poem cycles written in the wake of imperial incursions and diasporic resettlements. Some of these poems have engrossing plots and rounded characters, such as a novel in verse about yuppies in San Francisco. Others complicate narrative development in favor of more cyclical or disjunctive effects, such as a postcolonial epic inspired by the 
Odyssey
, or a poem cycle that fractures and transforms legal language on the Zong, an 18th-century slave ship whose captain tried to maximize his company’s profits by throwing 150 Africans overboard to their deaths. We will examine the rich array of lyric, narrative, and dramatic forms that poets have developed over the last century to evoke the many kinds of crossings—cultural and textual, personal and communal, voluntary and forced—peculiar to our globalizing age. 
 We will read long poems by Aimé Césaire, Kamau Brathwaite, Derek Walcott, Michael Ondaatje, M. NourbeSe Philip, and Vikram Seth, with additional short poems, essays, and excerpts by St.-John Perse, T. S.

CLEN GU4771,The Literary History of Atrocity,"Sometime around the publication of Garcia Marquez’s classic novel 
One Hundred Years of Solitude 
in 1967, novelists who wanted to make a claim to ethical and historical seriousness began to include a scene of extreme violence that, like the banana worker massacre in Garcia Marquez, seemed to offer a definitive guide to the moral landscape of the modern world. This course will explore both the modern literature that was inspired by Garcia Marquez’s example and the literature that led up to this extraordinary moment—for example, the literature dealing with the Holocaust, with the dropping of the atomic bomb, with the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, and with the Allied bombing of the German cities. It will also ask how extraordinary this moment in fact was, looked at from the perspective of literature as a whole, by inspecting earlier examples of atrocities committed in classical antiquity, in the Crusades, against Native Americans and (in Tolstoy) against the indigenous inhabitants of the Caucasus. Before the concept of the non-combatant had been defined, could there be a concept of the atrocity? Could a culture accuse itself of misconduct toward the members of some other culture? In posing these and related questions, the course offers itself as a major but untold chapter both in world literature and in the moral history of humankind.",Bruce Robbins,2:40pm,3:55pm,10205,Morningside,GU4771-20193-001,The Literary Hist of Atro,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,http://culpa.info/professors/744,silver,34.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Robbins_%28academic%29,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145215/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLEN/GU4771-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20193CLEN4771W001,LECTURE

Personal relationships have been vectors of colonial power as well as sites of resistance. In this course we consider various ways in which love, desire and intimacy have emerged as questions in the French colonial context. The course covers a broad historical and geographic span stretching from the age of plantation slavery to the era of decolonization and from the Caribbean and Louisiana to Vietnam and Africa. We consider both the transmission of categories and practices across colonial contexts and historical transitions and regional specificities. The course methodology is interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from history, sociology and law. The primary lens is, however, be that of literature, a medium in which the personal dimensions of empire have often found expression.

CLGR GR6727,Hannah Arendt's Essays (in English),"Hannah Arendt's works are currently witnessing an unprecedented reception and revival. A slim volume of a previously untranslated English text, essentially an abbreviation, in lecture format, of her ideas on ""Ideology and Terror"", first published in ""Elements and Origins of Totalitarians Rule"" in 1958, sold 50,000 copies within three months in Germany. International publishing houses are cooperating to produce a new biography of the writer and philosophers. Moreover, the first two volumes of a hybrid, multi-lingual critical edition (edited, among others, by Barbara Hahn and James MacFarland) have appeared in recent months. What makes this maverick thinkerâ€”never accepted by the political Right and much maligned by the Leftâ€”so interesting today that even the strongly divergent reception lines in the US and Europe appear to converge and open up new venues? One possible answer is that Arendt believed courage (rather than morality or honesty) was the cardinal political virtue. In a time of 'fake news' and rising populism, her notoriously unpopular but courageous interventions in public debates (of which her report on the Eichmann-trial is only the most prominent example) stand out. Another reason for the recent surge in (not only academic) interest may have to do with the role literature plays in her thought. To explore both questions, the seminar will focus on the one hand on Arendt's 'interventions' in acute political and social conflicts, from the early essay ""We Refugees"" (1943) to her contested contribution to racial desegregation of schools in the south with her ""Reflections on Little Rock"" as well as her reflections on lying in politics, written on occasion of her publication of the Pentagon Papers on the strategies behind the Vietnam War. In addition, we will explore her (often no less contentious) portraits of US-American and European writers such as Auden, Broch, Benjamin, Brecht and others.",Eva Geulen,2:10pm,4:00pm,54556,Morningside,GR6727-20193-001,HANNAH ARENDT'S ESSAYS,Germanic Languages,CLGR,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145250/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLGR/GR6727-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20193CLGR6727G001,SEMINAR
CLGR GR6828,Aesthetics and Politics Today (in Englis,"On which grounds can we claim, in 2020 and with scholarly confidence, that a literary text has “progressive” or “right-wing” affinities? How do we measure the success of another text’s apparent experimental critique of racist or homophobic dispositifs? Or what could justify the declaration that a film elicits a revolutionary sensibility? Against the backdrop of new political populisms and fascisms, questions such as these couldn’t be more topical today. But do we have equally topical answers? Both within and beyond academia, political reading practices have long been countered with the charge that they don’t do justice to the aesthetic qualities of their object. In the twenty-first century, old-school articulations of this point have been revamped in the name of new formalisms and a range of postcritical methods. 
 The course starts from the premise that these new formalist and postcritical challenges are worth listening to, but do not require that we abandon the desire to read politically. Rather, they can help us refine our skills and develop interpretative methods accounting for hateful or empathetic, egalitarian or elitist overtones and undertones of aesthetic texts in non-reductive, non-symptomatic ways, making room for ambiguity, affective incongruity and multivoicedness, without entirely separating art from ideology. 
 Towards the goal of describing relations between aesthetics and politics in ever more convincing terms, we will return to the tradition of theorizing their interplay from the Frankfurt School to Jacques Rancière, along with selected texts from the fields of critical race and queer studies, and put all of them in a dialogue with new formalist and postcritical perspectives. As we go along, we will probe our reading skills on a number of aesthetic objects (literature & audiovisual).",Claudia Breger,4:10pm,6:00pm,54557,Morningside,GR6828-20193-001,AESTHETICS/POLITICS TODAY,Germanic Languages,CLGR,http://culpa.info/professors/13597,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145253/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLGR/GR6828-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20193CLGR6828G001,SEMINAR
CLGR GU4242,"Dangerous Passions: Collecting, Hoarding","The collector, warns the literary critic Walter Benjamin “is motivated by dangerous though domesticated passions.” Far from merely a playful or antiquarian practice, collecting was depicted by various authors and theorists as a pathological tendency which often borders on compulsion and kleptomania. This interdisciplinary seminar examines the psychological, economic, and aesthetic forces which motivate people to collect. From Noah’s Ark to A&E’s popular show, “Hoarders,” collecting is related to the practice of organizing, cataloguing, and understanding the world we live in. This seminar poses the question: to what extent is collecting a trans-historical phenomenon and to what extent is it a fundamentally modern process shaped by the expansion of capitalism and private property? How has technology informed the dynamics of collecting and how might we redefine it today given our virtually limitless electronic storage capabilities? Beginning with the Renaissance Wunderkammer and the emergence of the museum, we will examine what Benjamin calls the “domesticated” side of collecting. We will then turn our attention to the “dangerous” undercurrents of collecting by teasing out the differences between collecting, hoarding, and possessing. This seminar explores the dangerous political and ethical ramifications of collecting practices, such as the relationship between imperial conquest and the growth of museums, world fairs, and human zoos. Finally, to better understand the institutional dynamics of collecting, curating, and exhibiting, we will be visiting the American Museum of Natural History as well as the Trash Museum in Harlem.",Annie Pfeifer,4:10pm,6:00pm,10310,Morningside,GU4242-20193-001,Dangerous Passions,Germanic Languages,CLGR,http://culpa.info/professors/13753,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145248/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLGR/GU4242-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20193CLGR4242W001,SEMINAR

CLPS GU4200,FREUD,"Because of advances in feminist theory, infant research, clinical practice attachment theory and historical scholarship, a consensus has emerged concerning Freud's oeuvre over the past fifty years: the figure of the mother is largely absent from all aspects of his thinking. This includes his self-self analysis, case histories, theory of development and account of religion and civilization. This fact will provide our point of reference for examining the development of Freud's thought. We will first explore the biographical roots of this lacuna in Freud's thinking. We will then see how it played itself out as his long and abundant career unfolded. We will examine texts regarding all the aspects of his thinking and from the different periods of his life.",Marcus Coelen,4:10pm,6:00pm,20190,Morningside,GU4200-20193-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CLPS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145120/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLPS/GU4200-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

CLPS GU4251,GLOBAL FREUD,"Prerequisites: Prior study of Freudian theory and psychoanalysis. 
 While there is a general familiarity with the history of psychoanalysisâ€™s spread from Vienna throughout Europe, and from the European centers of psychoanalysis to the US, less is known about its broader internationalization. This course explores the globalization of Freudian theory, and the varying ways it has been read and deployed by intellectuals, artists, and political activists--among others--in various parts of the world. Whether its central appeal was to pre-Revolution Russian intellectuals, who wished to assert their cosmopolitanism and kinship with Europe; to Mexican judges, who employed it to analyze criminal defendants; or to Egyptian experts in dreams, who added this tool to their analytic toolkit, psychoanalysis lent itself to novel, and often contrasting, interpretations and uses. 
             In this class, we will examine how Freudâ€™s universal model of the mind and theory of the subject were refashioned and repurposed to address specific social problems and to advance particular political projects, and how they were revised to conform to local concepts of emotion and the self. We will consider how a system of thought grounded in secularity and individualism was adapted for faith-based and communitarian societies. In addition, we will look into the ways Freudian notions of the unconscious intersected with existing philosophical traditions, and how other cornerstones of psychoanalytic thought were blended with local interpretive practices. Finally, we will address a number of issues that have arisen in the global transmission of psychoanalysis, including problems in the translation of Freudian theory from the original German, and the formation and ongoing conflicts of the International Psychoanalytic Association.",Karen Seeley,10:10am,12:00pm,20179,Morningside,GU4251-20193-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CLPS,http://culpa.info/professors/1705,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145122/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CLPS/GU4251-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

A body of selected films by Soviet and post-Soviet directors which exemplify the function of filmmaking as a tool of appropriation of the colonized, their cultural and political subordination by the Soviet center will be examined in terms of postcolonial theories. The course will focus both on Russian cinema and often overlooked work of Ukrainian, Georgian, Belarusian, Armenian, etc. national film schools and how they participated in the communist project of fostering a ┬źnew historic community of the Soviet people┬╗ as well as resisted it by generating, in hidden and, since 1991, overt and increasingly assertive ways their own counter-narratives.

Generally the course fills with ICLS students each semester. Students MAY NOT register themselves for this course. Contact the ICLS office for more information at icls.columbia@gmail.com. This course was formerly numbered as G4900. This course introduces beginning graduate students to the changing conceptions in the comparative study of literatures and societies, paying special attention to the range of interdisciplinary methods in comparative scholarship. Students are expected to have preliminary familiarity with the discipline in which they wish to do their doctoral work. Our objective is to broaden the theoretical foundation of comparative studies to negotiate a conversation between literary studies and social sciences. Weekly readings are devoted to intellectual inquiries that demonstrate strategies of research, analysis, and argumentation from a multiplicity of disciplines and fields, such as anthropology, history, literary criticism, architecture, political theory, philosophy, art history, and media studies. Whenever possible, we will invite faculty from the above disciplines and fields to visit our class and share their perspectives on assigned readings. Students are encouraged to take advantage of these opportunities and explore fields and disciplines outside their primary focus of study and specific discipline.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,20177,Morningside,GR6100-20193-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145103/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GR6100-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

Rather than foregrounding a single case study, the syllabus is organized around the proposition that any consideration of diaspora requires a consideration of comparative and overlapping diasporas, and as a consequence a confrontation with multilingualism, creolization and the problem of translation.

CPLS GU4111,WORLD PHILOLOGY,"Philology, broadly defined as the practice of making sense of texts, is a fundamental human activity that has been repeatedly institutionalized in widely separated places and times. In the wake of the formation of the modern academic disciplines in the nineteenth century and their global spread, it became difficult to understand the power and glory of older western philology, and its striking parallels with other pre- and early modern forms of scholarship around the globe. This class seeks to create a new comparative framework for understanding how earlier generations made sense of the texts that they valued, and how their practices provide still-vital models for us at a time of upheaval in the format and media of texts and in our scholarly approaches to them. Students will encounter key fields of philology—textual criticism, lexicography, grammar, and, above all, commentary—not in the abstract but as instantiated in relation to four foundational works—the Confucian Analects, the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki, the Aeneid, and the Tale of Genji—and the scholarly traditions that grew up around them. We are never alone when we grapple with the basic question of how to read texts whose meaning is unclear to us. Over the course of the semester, this class will foster a global understanding of the deep roots and strange parallels linking contemporary reading and interpretation to the practices of the past.",David B Lurie,10:10am,12:00pm,58853,Morningside,GU4111-20193-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,http://localhost:8801/professors/132,silver,17.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529145053/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CPLS/GU4111-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

Our inquiry into the nature of fascism will primarily focus on Western European cases- some where it remained an intellectual movement (France), and others such as Italy and Germany where it was a ruling regime. Fascism will be discussed in many dimensions- in its novelty as the only new “ism” of the twentieth century, in its relation to nascent technology (radio and film), its racial and gendered configurations, in its relation to (imperialist) war. We will explore the appeal of this ideology to masses and to the individual. Who becomes a fascist? What form of inquiry provides the best explanations? Can art- literature and film- somehow render what social science cannot? Can fascism outlive the century in which it was born and occur in the 21

CPLT BC3000,GLOBAL LONG-FORM PHOTOGRAPHY: HISTORY AN,"In a time where almost everyone has a camera phone to capture the present, photographic artists are increasingly pointing their practice towards history and memory to give insight into the past. In weekly seminars, we will look at how contemporary global photographers are challenging national narratives and rewriting history. We will engage in the question of how photography, arguably the artistic medium most tied to the present, has been used to explore that which is no longer there. We will look at how photographers from Asia, Africa, Latin America and Middle East have used their contemporary practice to address issues of collective memory as it pertains to dictatorship, state sponsored violence, and contested history.  We will investigate how artists from the world over have employed  photographic practices to explore the inherited legacies and injustices of previous generations. And we will look at how artists have used re-enactment, commemoration, re- imaging, and inclusive archive to explore history and memory within the visual realm. 
 Over the course of the term, students will develop and deliver an in-depth photographic essay on a subject of their choice that has been approved by the instructor. We will explore subject matter, editing and ways in which testimony and archive can be used to give a more contextual reading to long form photography. 
 We will study photography as an epistemology in and of itself – that is we will look at long-form photography by the study and critique of photographic essays and photographic monographs. Critically we will be looking beyond the North American photographic canon to view the works of global image-makers. Some of the photographers whose in-depth work we will be exploring are:  An My Le; Lu Guang; Paula Luttringer; Ori Gherst; Rula Halawani; Luis Gonzalez Palma; Jo Ractcliffe; Shoemi Tomatsu; Fazal Sheik; Sophie Ristelheber; Walid Radd; Kikuje Kawada; Joshua Lutz; Rena Effendi and many others. Viewings of their works will be augmented by weekly critical readings in photography and memory.

We will not treat either of these categories of difference as a given, nor as separable from other axes of social difference. Rather, we will apply an interdisciplinary and intersectional framework to illuminate how these concepts have come to emerge and cohere within a number of familiar and less familiar socio-cultural and historical contexts. We will consider how racial and ethnic differentiation as fraught but powerful processes have bolstered global labor regimes and imperial expansion projects; parsed, managed, and regulated populations; governed sexed and gendered logics of subject and social formation; and finally, opened and constrained axes of self-understanding, political organization, and social belonging. Special attention will be given to broadening students' understanding of racial and ethnic differentiation beyond examinations of identity.

This course takes a comparative approach to understanding how and why food is a central component of contemporary sovereignty discourse. More than just a question of eating, Indigenous foodways offer important critiques of, and interventions to, the settler state: food connects environment, community, public health, colonial histories, and economics. Students will theorize these connections by reading key works from across the fields of Critical Indigenous Studies, Food Studies, Philosophy, History, and Anthropology. In doing so, we will question the potentials, and the limits, of enacting, food sovereignty within the settler state, whether dietary decolonization is possible in the so-called age of the Anthropocene, and the limits of working within and against today‚Äôs legacies of the colonial food system.",Hiilei J Hobart,12:10pm,2:00pm,57896,Morningside,UN3219-20193-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529162057/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CSER/UN3219-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

From the judicial and popular riots in the U.S. justified by recurrent rumors of African-American insurrection, to accusations that French Jews were players in the 'white slave trade,' to tales of white fat-stealing monsters among indigenous people of Bolivia and Peru, rumors play a key role in constructing, enforcing, and contesting regimes of racial identity and domination. In order to grasp rumor's importance for race, we will need to understand how it works, so our readings will cover both instances of racialized rumor-telling, conspiracy theories and mass panics, and some key approaches to how rumors work as a social phenomenon. The instructor will expect you to post a response to the reading on Courseworks each week and to engage actively in class discussion. There will be an in-class midterm exam, and you will be able to choose between writing an independent research project or doing a take-home exam.",Stuart Rockefeller,10:10am,12:00pm,57874,Morningside,UN3904-20193-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529162100/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/CSER/UN3904-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

Second, this seminar asks students to think critically about the approaches they employ in pursuing their research. The course will culminate in a semester project, not a fully executed research project, but rather an 8-10 page proposal for research that will articulate a question, provide basic background on the context that this question is situated in, sketch preliminary directions and plot out a detailed methodological plan for answering this question. Students will be strongly encouraged to think of this proposal as related to their thesis or senior project.

This class combines the critical with the creative—students have to read and critic memoirs as well as write a final 10-page nonfiction creative writing piece. Students will also have the opportunity to speak to some Latino and Asian authors in class or via SKYPE. Students will be asked to prepare questions in advance for the author, whose work(s) we will have read and discussed. This usually arises interesting and thought-provoking conversations and debates.

From New Orleans jazz to Texas 
corridos

DNCE BC3567,DANCES OF INDIA,"A range of dance genres, from the traditional to the innovative, co-exist as  representations of  ""Indianness"" in India,  and beyond. Identities onstage and in films, morph as colonial, national, and global contexts change.  This course zooms from micro to macro views of twentieth century staged dances as culturally inflected discourse. We review how Indian classical dance aligns with the oldest of performance texts, and with lively discourses (rasa as a performance aesthetic, Orientalism, nationalism,  global recirculations) through the ages, not only in India but also in Europe, Britain and America. Throughout the course, we ask:-  How is culture embodied? How do historical texts configure dance today? How might they affect our thinking on mind-body, practice-theory, and traditional-contemporary divides?  How does bodily patterning influence the ways that we experience our surroundings and vice versa?  Can cultural imaginaries  instigate action?

We will use the intersecting lenses of gender/sexuality, class and race/ethnicity to analyze the dramatic new inequalities created in arguably the largest and fastest accumulation of residential-real estate wealth in history. We will examine topics such as how skyrocketing home prices and state-led urbanization have created winners and losers based on gender, sexuality, class, race/ethnicity and location (
hukou
), as China strives to transform from a predominantly rural population to one that is 60 percent urban by 2020. We explore the vastly divergent effects of urban real-estate development on Chinese citizens, from the most marginaliz4d communities in remote regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to hyper-wealthy investors in Manhattan. Although this course has no formal prerequisites, it assumes some basic knowledge of Chinese history. If you have never taken a course on China before, please ask me for guidance on whether or not this class is suitable for you.

EAAS GU4840,CHINA AND POLITICS OF DESIRE,"A recent American newspaper headline announced that China has become “the most materialistic country the world.” Globally circulating narratives often interpret Chinese consumers’ demand for commodities as an attempt to fill a void left by the absence of the Maoist state, traditional religious life, and Western-style democracy. But things aren’t as simple as they appear. This course explores the intertwined questions of “Chinese” desire and the desire for China. Avoiding reductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural human attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the production and management of desire within a complex global field. Drawing on ethnographies, films, short stories, and psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting figure of desire across the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics, government officials, intellectuals, and artists have represented Chinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders’ attempts to improve the “quality” of the country’s population to citizens’ dreams of home ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and other commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures of recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been conceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters.",Nicholas A Bartlett,10:10am,12:00pm,07110,Barnard College,GU4840-20193-001,POL OF DESIRE CONTEMP CHINA,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,EAAS,http://culpa.info/professors/13393,silver,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529152701/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EAAS/GU4840-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,4,,W,20193EAAS4840W001,SEMINAR
EAAS UN3322,EAST ASIAN CINEMA,"This course introduces students to major works, genres and waves of East Asian cinema from the Silent era to the present, including films from Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. How has cinema participated in East Asian societies’ distinct and shared experiences of industrial modernity, imperialism and (post)colonialism? How has cinema engaged with questions of class, gender, ethnic and language politics? In what ways has cinema facilitated transnational circulations and mobilizations of peoples and ideas, and how has it interacted with other art forms, such as theatre, painting, photography and music? In this class, we answer these questions by studying cinemas across the region sideby- side, understanding cinema as deeply embedded in the region’s intertwining political, social and cultural histories and circulations of people and ideas. We cover a variety of genres such as melodrama, comedy, historical epic, sci-fi, martial arts and action, and prominent film auteurs such as Yasujirō Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, Yu Hyŏnmok, Chen Kaige, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Ann Hui. As cinema is, among other things, a creative practice, in this course, students will be given opportunities to respond to films analytically and creatively, through writing as well as creative visual projects.

This course seeks to place this phenomenon within a longer historical, as well as a broader cross-cultural, context. Through an examination of texts and images spanning over thirteen centuries of Japanese history, along with comparable productions from other cultures, students will gain an understanding not only of different conceptions and representations of monsters, ghosts, and other supernatural creatures in Japan, but also of the role of the ""monstrous"" in the cultural imagination more generally. The course draws on various media and genres of representation, ranging from written works, both literary and scholarly, to the visual arts, material culture, drama, and cinema. Readings average 100-150 pages per week. Several film and video screenings are scheduled in addition to the regular class meetings.

EAAS UN3343,JAPANESE CONTEMP CINEMA & MEDIA CULTURE,"In this course, we will look at the contemporary history and theory of cinema and media culture in Japan.  To be more specific, the course will closely examine 1) the various traits of postmodern Japanese cinemas in the 1980s and the 1990s after the phase of global cinematic modernism, 2) contemporary media phenomena such as media convergence and the media ecologies of anime, 3) media activism after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and beyond.  We will proceed through careful analysis of films, anime, and digital media, while also addressing larger questions of historiography in general.  In other words, this course asks, what is it to study Japanese cinema and media (outside Japan)?  What would be a heuristic narrative mode to examine the (trans-)national history of Japanese cinema and media?  Such inquiries will be integrated into the ways we analyze and discuss the films and media works selected for our weekly screenings. 
 The readings will extend the realm of the course topics to include broader cultural criticism in an attempt to surface the interrelation of (audio-)visual media and culture in Japan.",Takuya Tsunoda,4:10pm,6:00pm,44369,Morningside,UN3343-20193-001,JAPANESE CONTEMP CINEMA & MEDI,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529152650/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EAAS/UN3343-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

ECON GR6493,BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,"Prerequisites: Completion of 1st year graduate program in Economics, or the instructor's permission. 
 The standard model of economic behavior describes a perfectly rational, self interested utility maximizer with unlimited cognitive resources. In many cases, this provides a good approximation to the types of behavior that economists are interested in. However, over the past 30 years, experimental and behavioral economists have documented ways in which the standard model is not just wrong, but is wrong in ways that are important for economic outcomes. Understanding these behaviors, and their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current economic inquiry. This course will study three important topics within behavioral economics: Bounded rationality, temptation and self control and reference dependent preferences. It will draw on research from behavioral economics, experimental economics, decision theory, psychology and neuroscience in order to describe the models that have been developed to explain failures of the standard approach, the evidence in support of these models, and their economic implications.",Mark Dean,12:10pm,2:00pm,47453,Morningside,GR6493-20193-001,,Economics,ECON,http://culpa.info/professors/13223,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529153945/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/GR6493-20193-001/,1102 International Affairs Building,,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,M,20193ECON6493G001,LECTURE

 The world is being transformed by dramatic increases in flows of people, goods and services across nations. Globalization has the potential for enormous gains but is also associated to serious risks. The gains are related to international commerce where the industrial countries dominate, while the risks involve the global environment, poverty and the satisfaction of basic needs that affect in great measure the developing nations. Both are linked to a historical division of the world into the North and the South-the industrial and the developing nations. Key to future evolution are (1) the creation of new markets that trade privately produced public goods, such as knowledge and greenhouse gas emissions, as in the Kyoto Protocol; (2) the updating of the Breton Woods Institutions, including the creation of a Knowledge Bank and an International Bank for Environmental Settlements.",Graciela Chichilnisky,2:40pm,3:55pm,10581,Morningside,GU4750-20193-001,,Economics,ECON,http://culpa.info/professors/2657,,7.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graciela_Chichilnisky,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529153819/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/GU4750-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ECON GU4850,COGNITIVE MECH & ECON BEHAVIOR,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 and STAT UN1201  
 Standard economic theory seeks to explain human behavior (especially in ""economic"" settings, such as markets) in terms of rational choice, which means that the choices that are made can be predicted on the basis of what would best serve some coherent objective, under an objectively correct understanding of the predictable consequences of alternative actions. Observed behavior often seems difficult to reconcile with a strong form of this theory, even if incentives clearly have some influence on behavior; and the course will discuss empirical evidence (both from laboratory experiments and observations ""in the field"") for some well-established ""anomalies."" But beyond simply cataloguing anomalies for the standard theory, the course will consider the extent to which departures from a strong version of rational choice theory can be understood as reflecting cognitive processes that are also evident in other domains such as sensory perception; examples from visual perception will receive particular attention. And in addition to describing what is known about how the underlying mechanisms work (something that is understood in more detail in sensory contexts than in the case of value-based decision making), the course will consider the extent to which such mechanisms --- while ""suboptimal"" from a normative standpoint that treats perfect knowledge of one's situation as costless and automatic --- might actually represent efficient uses of the limited information and bounded information-processing resources available to actual people (or other organisms). Thus the course will consider both ways in which the realism of economic analysis may be improved by taking into account cognitive processes, and ways in which understanding of cognitive processes might be advanced by considering the ""economic"" problem of efficient use of limited (cognitive) resources.",Michael D Woodford,10:10am,11:25am,47420,Morningside,GU4850-20193-001,,Economics,ECON,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dean_Woodford,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529153821/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/GU4850-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

 The honors thesis seminar is a year-long course, beginning in the fall semester and ending in the spring semester. Students who have been approved to enter the workshop will be registered for both semesters by the department during the first two weeks of classes; 3 points are earned per semester. This workshop may only be taken by students applying for departmental honors, and it also fulfills the economics seminar requirement for the economics major and all joint majors. Students must see the director during mid-semester registration in the spring to discuss their proposed thesis topic, at which time they will be matched with appropriate faculty who will act as their thesis adviser. Students will meet their adviser over the course of the year at mutually agreed upon times. A rough draft of the thesis will be due during the first week of February in the spring semester, and the final draft will be due three weeks before the last day of classes. Please note that for those joint majors that require two seminars, one in economics and one in the other discipline (i.e., Political Science), the economics senior honors thesis seminar only fulfills the economics seminar requirement.",Michael C Best,2:10pm,4:00pm,47432,Morningside,GU4999-20193-001,,Economics,ECON,http://culpa.info/professors/14068,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529153854/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/GU4999-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Columbia College

Throughout the semester, we will work to “complicate class”, reconsidering what class is, why class matters, and how we can best think about the relationship between social class and schooling. You will develop a language for talking about class, considering the affordances and constraints of various conceptions of class. You will also leave with critical questions about the possibilities and limitations of relying on schools as a solution to social problems. Recognizing restraints, we will conclude by reflecting on how we might work toward creating more equitable learning environments for poor and working-class students.",Rachel Throop,12:10pm,2:00pm,07908,Barnard College,BC3045-20193-001,EDUCATION & LIMITS EQUITY,Education @Barnard,EDUC,http://culpa.info/professors/13305,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529154139/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EDUC/BC3045-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

 This course explores igneous and metamorphic processes during creation and evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle lithosphere. We will start with decompression melting and melt transport in the mantle beneath the mid-ocean ridges, focusing on petrological, geochemical, geophysical and geological constraints on these processes. Then, we will take a similar approach to understanding igneous accretion of oceanic crust, and subsequent cooling and alteration via hydrothermal convection.This topic leads naturally into crustal formation during continental rifting. Then we will consider evidence for formation of continental crust via magmatism in volcanic arcs, review constraints on arc magmatic processes, and consider proposed processes for modification of arc crust to produce continental crust. Finally, if there is time, we will review data and ideas on formation of  the cratonic upper mantle (""mantle lithosphere"").

 Minerals come in dazzling colors, amazing shapes and with interesting optical effects. But mineralogy is also an essential tool for the understanding of Earth evolution. Minerals represent fundamental building blocks of the Earth system and planetary bodies. Minerals form through geological and biological processes such as igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary from high to low temperatures, from the deep interior to the Earthâ€™s surface and related to volcanism, tectonics, weathering, climate and life. Minerals are one of our most important sources of information on such processes through Earthâ€™s history. Minerals also represent important natural resources and are fundamental to the global economy and modern technology as we know it. , The goal of this class is to (1) understand the physical and chemical properties of minerals, (2) learn techniques of mineral identification with an emphasis on optical mineralogy, (3) understand the relationship between minerals and the broader geological context.",Cornelia Class,4:10pm,6:40pm,55517,Morningside,GU4113-20193-001,,Earth and Environmental Sciences,EESC,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529152454/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EESC/GU4113-20193-001/,506 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ENGL BC3177,VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE,"“We have become a novel-reading people,” wrote Anthony Trollope in 1870. “Novels are in the hands of us all; from the Prime Minister down to the last-appointed scullery maid.” This course will consider why the novel was so important to Victorian culture and society. What made the Victorian novel such a fertile form for grappling with the unprecedented cultural changes of the nineteenth century? To address this question, we will explore how Victorian novels both responded to, and participated in, major social and cultural shifts of the period, including industrialism and urbanization; colonialism and empire; the changing status of women, sexuality, and marriage; the emergence of Darwinism; class conflict and social reform; and the expansion of education and literacy. This course will also consider more broadly what novels are for, and what the Victorians thought they were for. Do novels represent the world as it really is, or do they imagine it as it ought to be? What kinds of solutions to social and political problems can novels offer? Can novels ethically improve (or corrupt) their readers? We will consider these issues in the context of realism, Victorian literature’s trademark genre, but we’ll also explore an array of other genres, such as the industrial novel, the Bildungsroman, the sensation novel, detective fiction, and gothic fiction. Authors include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Wilkie Collins, and others.",Rebecca J Hildebrand,1:10pm,2:25pm,07951,Barnard College,BC3177-20193-001,VICTORIAN LITERATURE: THE NOVE,English @Barnard,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160756/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3177-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

While we will devote some attention to the literary traditions that preceded British colonization, most of our readings will be of texts written in English between 1620 and 1800. These texts--histories, autobiographies, poems, plays, and novels--illuminate the complexity of this period of American culture. They tell stories of pilgrimage, colonization, and genocide; private piety and public life; manuscript and print publication; the growth of national identity (political, cultural, and literary); Puritanism, Quakerism, and Deism; race and gender; slavery and the beginnings of a movement towards its abolition.

,
Charlotte Brontë on her late sister the novelist Emily Brontë.
,This course examines the development of literary fiction in response to history. Through a diverse selection of books—novels, novellas, and verse—spanning nearly 2400 years, we will investigate the seemingly contradictory condition of the author as both outsider and insider.
,We will look at how writers from various backgrounds have addressed social and political alienation, national and personal crisis, through narrative. The uniqueness of the texts lies not just in how implicated they are in history, but in their resistance against generalization and intolerance.
,Two areas of critical concern govern the selection: Romanticism brings to focus responses to estrangement and injustice; and Modernism is seen as individual expression to alienation and exile. However, implicit also is the desire to complicate the distinction between those two schools. What unites these concerns, however, is how our writers’ artistic commitment, as both witnesses and participants, creates an opportunity for literature to reveal more than the author intends and, on the other hand, more than what power desires.",Hisham Matar,11:00am,12:50pm,08078,Barnard College,BC3192-20193-001,ESTRANGEMNT/EXILE GLOB NO,English @Barnard,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/11672,,1.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hisham_Matar,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160800/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/BC3192-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ENGL BC3223,NEW YORK IN TEN OBJECTS,"""New York in Ten Objects"" introduces students to the creative possibilities of the podcast. Drawing on the possibilities of interdisciplinary analysis and creative non-fiction, this course will equip students with a new storytelling medium that critically engages the city in which they live. The goal is to render ordinary topics extraordinary. 
 The starting points for our investigation are ten objects -- some iconic, some ironic, but all characteristic of New York City. Beginning with these quotidian objects, students will develop projects, in small groups and individually, that connect these objects with a broader societal movement, cultural idea, political cause, or scientific development significant to past or present New York City life.  
 To prepare students to develop their projects in an audio medium, we will first become familiar with a broad range of current podcasts, and will begin to break down the elements of podcast-storytelling as practiced today. Through workshops with IMATS in a weekly lab session, staged writing assignments and hands-on experience, students will learn how to collect audio interviews and ambient sound, to record voice-over narration, and to select and use musical and other sound snippets available on sound banks. Every student will storyboard their ideas, develop scripts, and produce a podcast by layering and editing their audio files.  
 In the end, this course will investigate how the popular medium of the podcast can serve as a locus of local conversation and public intellectual activity.   Students will discover the community in which they live in profound and intellectually rigorous new ways by learning how ordinary objects can breathe life into a story, and how audio stories can advance critical analysis.

We'll consider women's writing and women's reading through a variety of lenses, including domesticity and women's sphere, political action and suffrage, slavery and abolition, the economics of writing and publishing, sentimentality and anger, and canon formation and literary merit.  Authors include Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Susan Warner, Fanny Fern, Harriet Jacobs, Elizabeth Drew Stoddard, Louisa May Alcott, Emily Dickinson, Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins, Nellie Bly, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and Mary E.

ENGL GR6198,Staging Early Modern London,"This course examines the performances through which early modern London (c. 1558-1642) “staged” itself: at the public and private theaters, in settings such as the court and the Inns of Court, in civic and royal rituals, and in popular entertainments.   In so doing, we will examine how London’s sense of itself came to be shaped by its various performances – its relationship with the crown, with the country, with strangers and foreigners – and how key sites (the Royal Exchange, the Guildhall, the Thames, Covent Garden, Hyde Park) came to hold meaning for London audiences. 
 We will be reading texts by dramatists including Thomas Dekker, Ben Jonson, Francis Beaumont, Thomas Middleton, James Shirley, and Richard Brome, as well as less studied texts.   We will also be reading a set of critical works relating to early modern London and its various “stages”.",Alan Stewart,8:10am,10:00am,10306,Morningside,GR6198-20193-001,STAGING EARLY MODERN LOND,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/2053,,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160924/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6198-20193-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20193ENGL6198G001,SEMINAR

The turn of the century Berlin sociologist Georg Simmel and  the mid-19th c Parisian flaneur Baudelaire directly inspire influential late 20th c American theorists of 19th c modernity--Marshall Berman & Richard Sennett.

ENGL GR6835,THE INDUSTRIAL NOVEL,"This seminar offers intensive study of “the industrial novel,” a body of mid-Victorian fiction responding to the economic volatility and class conflict that accompanied the rise of industrial production.  In little more than a decade, treatments of this broad concern by a number of major novelists converged in a set of distinctive formal strategies, yet the relatively brief prominence of the form underscores an unusually direct connection with contemporary political anxieties.  As the industrial novel presses against the increasingly domestic preoccupations of mid-Victorian fiction, it throws those preoccupations into sharp relief, and more broadly illuminates the construction of Victorian domesticity itself.   We’ll be especially interested in the intersections of gender and class, the interplay of socio-economic history and narrative form, and the political dimensions of the mid-Victorian novel.  Finally, the topic poses large questions about genre and literary history: does “the industrial novel” denote a genre, and why apply that tag to works that rarely depict industrial labor?   Why not the “social problem” novel, the “domestic novel in Northern dress,” or even “the novel of insurrection”?  Major authors include Disraeli, Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, Kingsley, Dickens, and George Eliot; we’ll also gather in some of the political economy of John Stuart Mill and Marx, as well as the social reporting of Engels and others.",James E Adams,12:10pm,2:00pm,10334,Morningside,GR6835-20193-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/9599,silver,11.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160930/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6835-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ENGL GR6909,INTRO TO WRITING STUDIES,"Anyone who pursues a career as a college faculty member will teach writing—either formally, in a writing class, or informally, as we work with students who are new to our disciplines. However, many graduate students in the humanities have received no substantive training in the burgeoning field of writing studies. In English, career opportunities in writing studies have outpaced other field areas. The MLA’s 2016-2017 jobs list reported that 851 positions were advertised in English, 10% fewer than the previous year. Of those jobs, 217 were in writing studies, 187 were in British literature, and 172 were in American literature. Given that writing studies positions are also advertised elsewhere, the gap is likely larger.  
 This seminar will explore key debates in writing studies research and teaching methodologies, program development, and disciplinary and institutional status. Writing studies is the newest name for “rhetoric and composition,” a field which declared its existence in the mid-1960s, and draws its praxes and theories from classical rhetoric, applied linguistics, cognitive and developmental psychology, literary criticism, civic education, creative writing, and progressive pedagogy. Scholarship in writing studies since the 1960s has sought to deepen our understanding of how transactions work among writers, readers, and texts.  Writing studies prompts us to track how standards for “good” or “appropriate” academic writing change over time, and how the teaching of writing responds to social, political, institutional, and disciplinary forces. The readings in this course will help us to articulate our own philosophies of writing and shape approaches to pedagogy in our own fields. 
 Topis will include the following: how writers develop; intellectual practices that foster community among learners; the ethics and politics of textual transactions, including assessment; students’ rights to their own language; literacy acquisition across media; working in transnational and translingual spaces; genre and rhetorical theory; fostering knowledge and skills transfer; the impact of intersectionality on pedagogy and program design; and labor justice. 
 We will read works by foundational writing studies scholars including John Dewey, Wayne Booth, bell hooks, Victor Villaneuva, Jr., A. Suresh Canagarajah, and the current president of the Modern Language Association, Anne Ruggles Gere.  
 Participants will have the opportunity to ask how writing studies can deepen the und",Nicole Wallack,2:10pm,4:00pm,40455,Morningside,GR6909-20193-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/1758,,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160932/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GR6909-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ENGL GU4391,Nineteenth-Century Thrillers,"This lecture will investigate the ways in which the nineteenth-century novel is shaped by the forces of horror, sensation, suspense and the supernatural. We will ask how the melodramatic imagination, the rhetoric of monstrosity, and the procedures of detection mark high narrative realism with the signs of cultural anxieties building up around nineteenth-century revolution, industrialization, capitalism, bigamy, Catholicism and immigration. Looking at representative samples of the Romantic neo-gothic novel, mid-century ghost stories, the highly popular and controversial sensation novels of the 1860’s along with their spectacular iterations on the Victorian stage, we will come away with a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the intersection between the novel and popular entertainment.

Toppling classical hierarchies that had long enthroned the mind as sovereign, American writers open up subjectivity to a loss of control, as they suffer, survive and enjoy the risks of contingency, of cross-racial affiliations, of urgent improvisation amidst both the racism and the anonymity of urban life, as they pursue the censored, existential moments of doubt and exhilaration inhabiting the surface triumphalism of the post-war era.

The course will explore such questions through a focus on science-fiction as a genre, broadly construed.

ENGL GU4637,Literature and the Health Humanities,"Literature and medicine have always been in dialogue: Apollo was the god of physicians and poetry, while some of the greatest writers, such as John Keats and Anton Chekhov, were trained as doctors. In our time, literature and medicine have become ever more entwined in the burgeoning field of “health humanities” that bridges the practices of writer and caregiver. 
 In this lecture course, we will consider how creative literature enriches our understanding of health and illness by exploring contemporary narratives about health and medicine in a global context. We will read literary writing by physicians in genres such as the short story, the case history, the satirical novel, and the medical memoir. As we move through shifting paradigms in healthcare, we will attend to how prose fiction can excavate and illustrate conflicts in the medical encounter—power struggles between doctors and patients, science and superstition, and cultural contexts—along with the challenges of war and trauma. We will consider, too, how medical fictions create generative space for motifs of alterity—physical disability, aging, cognitive differences, and gender fluidity—in contemporary global literature in English. As we read, we will attend to how the study of literature creates a series of critical methods that can be applied to problems across the health humanities. Writers include Atul Gawande, Oliver Sacks, Paul Kalanithi, Emma Donoghue, Michael Ondaatje, Indra Sinha, Ian McEwan, and Maggie Nelson, among others. 
Both literature and pre-med students are invited to enroll.

ENGL GU4794,"Heroes, Lovers, and Visionaries: English","This course will introduce some of the most fascinating texts of the first eight hundred years of English literature, from the period of Anglo-Saxon rule through the Hundred Years’ War and beyond—roughly, 700–1500 CE. We will proceed by exploring the role of some crucial figures in medieval writing: heroes, lovers, and visionaries. These key players relate in complex ways to the major genres of the Middle Ages, such as epic, romance, and spiritual writing; part of our work will be disentangling these relationships. We’ll hit on some texts you’ve heard of – 
Beowulf
 and selections from Chaucer’s 
Canterbury Tales
 – while leaving time for some you may not have encountered – Marie de France’s 
Lais
 and Margery of Kempe’s 
Book
. Along the way, we’ll also hone skills of reading, writing, and oral expression crucial to appreciating and discussing literature in nuanced, supple ways.  
If you take this course, you’ll discover how medieval literature is both a mirror and a foil to modern literature. You’ll explore the plurilingual and cross-cultural nature of medieval literary production and improve (or acquire!) your knowledge of Middle English. You’ll discover sources for famous texts, like 
King Lear, 
and see the posterity of other famous texts, like the 
Aeneid. 
Plus, you’ll flex your writing muscles with two short textual analyses (2-4 pp.) and one longer research paper (8-10pp).",,2:40am,3:55am,13532,Morningside,GU4794-20193-001,"HEROES,LOVERS,VISIONARIES",English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160916/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/GU4794-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20193ENGL4794W001,LECTURE

 This course is intended to introduce students to the advanced study of literature. Students will read works from different genres (poetry, drama, and prose fiction), drawn from the medieval period to the present day, learning the different interpretative techniques required by each. The course also introduces students to a variety of critical schools and approaches, with the aim both of familiarizing them with these methodologies in the work of other critics and of encouraging them to make use of different methods in their own critical writing. This course (together with the companion seminar 
ENGL UN3011

To this end, we will be working closely with a set of texts that range in date from the 8th/7th c. BCE to the 20th century C, including: Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Du Bois, Nabokov and Rankine. Our seminar will operate on the assumption that we cannot know “what” these texts say or “what” their authors mean unless we come to grips with how they say what they say and how they mean what they mean. In pursuit of some answers, we will master the skill of reading quickly but carefully, balancing attention to the literary craft of our texts with scrutiny of their underlying arguments and agendas.

ENGL UN3398,Odd Women in Victorian England,"How do people find freedom within restrictive norms and laws? Victorian England, known for its rigid definitions of femininity, nonetheless produced a remarkable number of female outlaws, eccentrics, and activists: spinsters, feminists, working women, cross-dressers, women in “female marriages.” 
 “Odd Women in Victorian England,” an undergraduate seminar, will explore the pains and pleasures of gender non-conformity through the lens of nineteenth-century literary works, historical documents, and foundational texts in gender and sexuality studies. Readings will include the diaries of Anne Lister, a lesbian libertine; a slander case involving accusations of lesbianism at an all-girls school; the diaries of Hannah Munby, a servant whose upper-class lover fetishized her physical strength; the autobiographies of Annie Besant, socialist and birth-control activist, and Mary Seacole, a nurse who traveled the world; and three major works of Victorian fiction: 
Aurora Leigh, 
a narrative poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning; 
Villette, 
a novel by Charlotte Bronte; and 
Little Dorrit, 
a novel by Charles Dickens. The course will end with a late 20

ENGL UN3451,LITERATURE OF EMPIRE,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). This course focuses on plots of empire in the British novel of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It examines not only how empire was represented but also how the novel form gave visibility to the strategies of empire and also showed the tacit purposes, contradictions, and anxieties of British imperialism. The seminar is structured around the themes of: the culture of secrecy; criminality and detection; insurgency, surveillance, and colonial control; circulation and exchange of commodities; messianism and political violence. Specifically, the course will focus on how the culture of secrecy that accompanied imperial expansion defined the tools of literary imagination in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. While most studies of culture and imperialism examine the impact of colonial expansion on the geography of narrative forms, this seminar looks more closely at the language of indirection in English novels and traces metaphors and symbols to imperialism's culture of secrecy. It begins with the simple observation that both colonizers and colonized felt the need to transmit their communications without having their messages intercepted or decoded. Translated into elusive Masonic designs and prophecy (as in Kim), codes of collective action (as in Sign of Four), or extended dream references (as in The Moonstone), the English novel underscores the exchange of information as one of the key activities of British imperialism. Forcing hidden information into the open also affects the ways that colonial â€˜otherness' is defined (as in The Beetle). How espionage and detection correlate with impenetrability and interpretation will be one among many themes we will examine in this course. The seminar will supplement courses in the nineteenth-century English novel, imperialism and culture, and race, gender, and empire, as well as provide a broad basis for studies of modernism and symbolism. Readings include Rudyard Kipling, Kim and ""Short Stories""; Arthur Conan Doyle's Sign of Four; Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone; Richard Marsh, The Beetle; RL Stevenson, Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Rider Haggard, She; Haggard, King Solomon's Mines; Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent. Course requirements: One oral presentation; two short papers, each 4-5 pages (double-spaced); and a final paper, 7-10 pages (double-spaced).

ENGL UN3520,INTRO TO ASIAN AMERICAN LIT & CULTURE,"This course is a survey of Asian North American literature and its contexts.  To focus our discussion, the course centers on examining recurring cycles of love and fear in Asian North American relations from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first centuries. We will first turn to what became known as “yellow peril,” one effect of exclusion laws that monitored the entrance of Asians into the United States and Canada during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the corresponding phenomenon of Orientalism, the fascination with a binary of Asia and the West. The second section of the course will focus on how Asian North American authors respond to later cycles of love and fear, ranging from the forgetting of Japanese internment in North America and the occupation of the Philippines; to the development of the model minority mythology during the Cold War. The final section will examine intimacies and exclusions in contemporary forms of migration, diaspora, and community communities.",Denise Cruz,11:40am,12:55pm,40447,Morningside,UN3520-20193-001,INTRO TO ASN-AMER LIT,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/13723,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160828/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3520-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

ENGL UN3579,Castaways and Containers: Modernity at S,"In this course, we’ll explore the ambitions, challenges, and failures of globalization through the lens of castaway literature, with works spanning from the seventeenth century to the present. In today’s postindustrial economies, labor has been outsourced to other parts of the world, and we depend on global shipping networks to supply us with commodities and to relieve us of our massive outputs of waste. Manufactured goods, raw materials, trash, people, and nonhuman species all circulate the globe via container ships and shipping networks that we rarely consider when we purchase something at a local Target. This course moves back and forth between early modernity and the present to consider the wastes generated by global economic circuits. We’ll begin by locating the origins of the global capitalist imaginary in texts written by proponents of colonial exploration and expansion. We’ll then turn to the transatlantic slave trade and to the archives of the black Atlantic to investigate forms of racialized violence and anticolonial resistance in the history of finance capital in the Atlantic world. Finally, we’ll bring our observations to bear on the forms of globalization that sustain contemporary postindustrial economies: from the containerization of shipping to the uneven environmental harms endured by nonhuman ecosystems and the poor in the global South.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,10321,Morningside,UN3579-20193-001,MODERNITY AT SEA,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160831/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/UN3579-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,4,,M,20193ENGL3579W001,SEMINAR
ENGL UN3637,Poetry and Catastrophe,"This seminar begins with a simple paradox: why is it that poetry is inconsequential to our day-to-day lives, but when faced with catastrophe--war, environmental disaster, personal loss--it is so common to turn to poetry? As W.H. Auden wrote in response to the death of W.B. Yeats and in the shadow of a new war, ""poetry makes nothing happen,"" and yet ""it survives/ ... / A way of happening, a mouth."" Our task will be to understand what Auden meant as well as to explore alternative views of poetry's resources for responding to catastrophe. After a brief introduction to interpreting poetic form, both in single-author works and also in groups of poems from different poets written in response to specific catastrophes (World War I, the Holocaust, and 9/11). We will study works from a variety of schools and movements, mainly British and American, with all readings in English. Some of the poets considered are Wilfred Owen, W.H. Auden, Jorie Graham, T.S.

ENGL UN3891,INTRO TO CLASSICAL RHETORIC,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). This course examines rhetorical theory from its roots in ancient Greece and Rome and reanimates the great debates about language that emerged in times of national expansion and cultural upheaval. We will situate the texts of Plato, Isocrates, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and others in their historical contexts to illuminate ongoing conversations about the role of words and images in the negotiation of persuasion, meaning making, and the formation of the public. In the process, we will discover that the arguments of classical rhetoric play out all around us today. Readings from thinkers like Judith Butler, Richard McKeon, Robert Pirsig, and Bruno Latour echo the ancients in their debates about hate speech regulation, the purpose of higher education, and the ability of the sciences to arrive at truth. We will discover that rhetoricians who are writing during eras of unprecedented expansion of democracies, colonization, and empire have a great deal to say about the workings of language in our globalizing, digitizing age.

ENTA UN3340,Environmental Crisis on the Shakespearea,"Our current environmental crisis has fractured familiar narratives about the relationship between humanity and the natural world. To begin reimagining this relationship, this seminar will turn back the clock to the Renaissance and the birth of the English theater industry, where Shakespeare and his contemporaries were still attempting to understand what counts as “nature” within the confines of the playhouse. We will explore the forest of Arden with its “tongues in trees” and “books in the running brooks” from 
As You Like It
, the stormy heath beset by “cataracts and hurricanos” in 
King Lear
, and the “wild waters” of the Mediterranean agitated by Prospero in 
The Tempest 
alongside environments that might not seem immediately “natural” to us today, including the ruins of Catholic cloisters, bloody battlefields, polluted fountains, smoke-spewing hell mouths, and the empty streets of a city wracked by plague. By considering these diverse environments together, this seminar will not only complicate our modern distinction between nature and culture, but it will also trace the many ways that environmental crisis materialized both on and off stage in the early modern period. 
 To deepen our conversation about premodern environments, this seminar will also engage with current scholarship in ecocriticism – a growing critical field that investigates the representational problems posed by our current environmental crisis. Our course will consider what the settings, conventions and resource management strategies of the early modern stage might have to teachus about the ways we think of, interact with, or use “nature” today. As we make our way through some of the period’s most experimental plays, we will also consider how the theater, due to its generic variety, its embodied form, and its material dependencies, might be uniquely positioned to model living within and reckoning with environmental crisis or change.",Bernadette A Myers,12:10pm,2:00pm,10350,Morningside,UN3340-20193-001,Environmental Crisis & Sh,English and Comparative Literature,ENTA,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160951/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENTA/UN3340-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,4,,M,20193ENTA3340W001,SEMINAR

We will consider why theatre practitioners often provide the most influential theoretical perspectives, how the drama inquires into (among other things) the possibilities of theatre, and the various ways in which the social, spiritual, performative, political, and aesthetic elements of drama and theatre interact. Two papers, weekly responses, and a class presentation are required. Readings include Aristotle, Artaud, Bharata, Boal, Brecht, Brook, Castelvetro, Craig, Genet, Grotowski, Ibsen, Littlewood, Marlowe, Parks, Schechner, Shakespeare, Sowerby, Weiss, and Zeami.

ENTA UN3783,US Theatre in the 21st Century,"In this seminar, we will read and view plays that tell new stories—some that took Broadway by storm and others that had only a brief life onstage. We will ask how a moment of unprecedented diversity in US playwriting responds to earlier eras of theater, what it suggests for the future, and what it leaves us still wanting. Can playwrights still experiment with new forms—and can audiences still be surprised or shocked by theater? How does the US history of settler colonialism, slavery, and changing immigration policies show up in playwriting today? Who is represented onstage, who is pulling the creative strings behind the scenes, and who is doing the work of getting the show on its feet every night? We will encounter some of the most innovative American playwrights and performers of the 21st century—including Suzan-Lori Parks, Annie Baker, Taylor Mac, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, and Peggy Shaw—through play texts, videos of performances, and one class trip to see a new play together. This course is open to English and Theater majors, as well as non-majors with an interest in theater. Email Danielle at

EPID P8416,Spatial Epidemiology,"Spatial epidemiology is the study of geographic distributions and determinants of health in populations. The goal of this class is to introduce students to relevant theory and methods, in order to provide the foundational skills required to understand and critically analyze spatial epidemiologic studies. The course emphasizes spatial epidemiology as a sub-discipline of epidemiology while acknowledging the many scientific disciplines that shape it, including biostatistics, cartography, criminology, demography, economics, geography, psychology, and sociology. We begin by defining spatial epidemiology and exploring these multi-disciplinary roots, with particular regard to the theoretical causal mechanisms that provide a bridge between social and physical environmental conditions and population health. We then provide a basic overview of geographic information systems and their utility for descriptive spatial epidemiology—including data visualization and cluster detection—before demonstrating how to incorporate spatial structures within conventional epidemiologic study designs to examine associational and causational relationships between environmental conditions and health outcomes. Class readings describe advances in theory and methods for spatial epidemiology and related disciplines, as well as concrete examples of applications for communicable disease, non-communicable disease, and injury epidemiology. This course is intended for doctoral and 2ndyear MPH students.",,8:30am,11:20am,13336,Health Science,P8416-20193-001,,Epidemiology,EPID,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529161929/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EPID/P8416-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,F,20193EPID8416P001,LECTURE

EPID P8447,HIV PROGRAM MONITORING AND DISEASE SURVE,"Epidemiologic methods are increasingly applied to generate 
strategic information
 in the context of the global HIV response, including via routine program monitoring and surveillance. Strategic information, in turns, plays a fundamental role in improving the direction and focus of national and local HIV programs. Specifically, routinely 
monitoring
 outputs and, in some cases, outcomes of HIV programs is critical to ensuring prevention, care and treatment targets are met and high-quality services are delivered. 
Surveillance
, through its focus on the occurrence, distribution and trends in HIV infection, risk behaviors and mortality is crucial both to ensuring programs are adapted to and reach those in need and to providing critical data on program outcomes and impacts. This online course introduces students to the concepts and functions of these two components of strategic information, and to special considerations in their application in resource-limited settings. Students will gain practical experience translating concepts into application for actual programs. While the course lectures will approach strategic information through the lens of HIV programs, there will be an opportunity to apply lessons learned to other global health programs.",Batya O Elul,,,13529,Presbyterian Hospital,P8447-20193-D01,HIV PRGM MONIT & DIS SURV,Epidemiology,EPID,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529161937/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/EPID/P8447-20193-D01/,,,,1.5,,,20193EPID8447PD01,LECTURE

 In 1989, the Hollywood studio system was languishing in a creative drought, until Steven Soderbergh's sex, lies, and videotape blew up the dam. Suddenly, audiences were eager for new, exciting visions free from establishment oversight. The next ten years saw the emergence of directors like Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, Kevin Smith, Richard Linklater, Jim Jarmusch, Lisa Cholodenko and many others. This course, arranged chronologically, will look at different filmmakers each week, while exploring the circumstances that allowed this movement to exist; what caused it to thrive, and what lingering effects did it have on today's cinema.",Breixo Viejo Vinas,10:10am,1:55pm,08163,Barnard College,BC3225-20193-001,,Film @Barnard,FILM,http://culpa.info/professors/14100,gold,5.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529163042/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/BC3225-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

FILM GU4920,Seeing Narrative,"An advanced film theory ""workshop"" in which we shall avoid reading film theory in favor of a selection of other texts, taken mainly from the domains of art history, philosophy, and literature. Our central question will be: What can we, who have grown up in the age of cinema and digital media, learn from discourses about vision and its relation to narrative that pre-date the cinema, or that consider the cinema only marginally? In this course, we shall begin to approach some of the major topics of contemporary film theory -- narrativity, subject-construction, the relation of words to images -- through the lens of texts that have remained largely outside the network of citations and references we normally associate with the work of professional media theory. We might begin the groundwork for an ""opening up"" or critique of some of the blind spots of current theory; at the very least, we shall be reading works that challenge our usual ways of theorizing.",James A Schamus,6:00pm,9:00pm,10313,Morningside,GU4920-20193-001,,Film,FILM,http://culpa.info/professors/1431,silver,8.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Schamus,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529163102/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/GU4920-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,M,20193FILM4920W001,SEMINAR
FILM GU4951,NEW MEDIA ART,"The rapid democratization of technology has led to a new wave of immersive storytelling that spills off screens into the real world and back again. These works defy traditional constraints as they shift away from a one-to-many to a many-to-many paradigm, transforming those formerly known as the audience from passive viewers into storytellers in their own right. New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape.   
 New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester we'll explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. 
 The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia‚Äôs Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings. It is in the interaction between these two perspectives that the course will explore the parameters of emerging frontiers in media art and the challenges these pose for existing critical vocabularies.",,2:00pm,5:00pm,98569,Morningside,GU4951-20193-001,,Film,FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529163105/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/GU4951-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

FILM UN2190,TOPICS IN AMERICAN CINEMA,"Film Noir: , This course surveys the American film genre known as film noir, focusing primarily on the genre’s heyday in the 1940s and early 1950s, taking into account some of its antecedents in the hard-boiled detective novel, German Expressionism, and the gangster film, among other sources. We will consider a number of critical and theoretical approaches to the genre, and will also study a number of film noir adaptations and their literary sources. , Comedy: , This course will explore the history of American film comedy from the origins of cinema to the present. In its various forms, comedy has always been a staple of American film production; but it has also always been a site of heterogeneity and nonconformity in the development of American cinema, with neither its form nor its content fitting normative models of film practice. This course accounts for that nonconformity by exploring comedy’s close and essential links to “popular” cultural sources (in particular, vaudeville, variety, stand-up); it looks at how different comic filmmakers have responded to and reshaped those sources; and it examines the relation between comedy and social change. Rather than engage the entire spectrum of comic styles (animation, mockumentary, etc.), this course is primarily focused on a single tradition bridging the silent and sound eras: the performance-centered, “comedian comedy” format associated with performers as diverse as Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, the Marx Brothers, and, into the present, Sacha Baron Cohen, Dave Chappelle, Amy Schumer, and others. “Laughter and its forms,” writes theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, “represent the least scrutinized sphere of the people's creation.” This course will restore film comedy to the scrutiny it deserves, examining both its inward formal development and its external relation to other modes of social expression. , Western: , This course surveys the first century of the American Western film genre, and its relation to American imaginings and ideologies of the “frontier,” with in-depth readings of key precursor texts, including memoirs, histories, novels, and other forms.

FILM UN2296,ARAB & AFRICAN FILMMAKING,"*An overview of the major developments in the art and industry of cinema in the Arab World and Africa, ranging from its earliest days to the most recent works of the digital era. Although often the victims of negative stereotyping in US and Europe mass culture, Arab and African filmmakers, especially since the Sixties, have developed dynamic national cinemas that have sought to tell their own stories in their own ways—even when those accounts often reveal problems and contradictions in their societies. The interaction of Arab and African filmmakers with international movements such as neorealism, modernism, 
cinema vérité
, and postmodernism will be addressed. The course divides into three parts: four weeks on Egypt, far and away the most developed film industry in either region; four weeks on the cinemas of other Arab nations (Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, Palestine); and five on sub-Saharan African cinema. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Youssef Chahine, Elia Suleiman, Ousmane Sembene and Abderrahmane Sissako.

 Focusing on new and recent films, this course will help students improve their ability to analyze film, and to create strong arguments in an original voice (a skill that translates to other kinds of writing, including film pitches). In addition to screenings and discussions, we will do in-class writing, and evaluate recently published criticism. The course is based on the assumption that there is no right or wrong opinion, just better or worse arguments, which the course and the instructorâ€™s individual comments on papers will help you refine. Regular writing assignments include short reviews and longer essays. Prerequisite: Non-majors require instructorâ€™s permission. Submit a short writing sample to

 Advanced Film Production Practice is an advanced production and lecture course for students who wish to obtain a deeper understanding of the skills involved in screenwriting, directing and producing.  Building on the fundamentals established in the Labs for Fiction and Non-Fiction Filmmaking, this seminar further develops each student’s grasp of the concepts involved in filmmaking through advanced analytical and practical work to prepare Thesis film materials. 
 Short films are the gateway for any writer/director or producer seeking a career in film.  From pitch to script to final film, students learn the importance of identifying and developing producible ideas and scripts that feature a strong directorial “voice.”  Starting with a close analysis of successful short films, students then apply those principles in writing, directing and producing their own Thesis short film.  A study of the marketplace for short films (festivals and distribution) and the industry and academic options available to emerging filmmakers, enables students to develop an action plan for the completed Thesis short film.",Benjamin C Leonberg,10:00am,1:00pm,98396,Morningside,UN3915-20193-001,ADVANCED FILM PRODUCTION PRACT,Film,FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529163047/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/UN3915-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

 In-depth survey of the writers who exemplified French existentialism: Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir. The texts have been chosen for the richness with which they address fundamental philosophical questions about the meaning of life, especially questions of death and suffering, freedom and responsibility, legitimate and illegitimate violence. The first objective of this class is to show how existentialist thought combines literature and philosophy; the second objective is to gain a broad, but also deep familiarity with 20th-century French literature and thought.

FREN GU4627,Communism or Democracy? A French Debate,"In the last three decades of the 20th century, i.e. roughly in the wake of the 68 insurrections and the final collapse of the Soviet regime and the end of the Cold War, a lively debate took place in France as in other countries, but with specific character, which involved a number of prominent philosophers, writers and political theorists, usually (but not always) classified on the left: Castoriadis, Lefort, Lyotard, Blanchot, Derrida, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe, Abensour, Rancière, Poulantzas, Foucault, Gauchet, and others. It took place in certain academic seminars and in prestigious or less well-known journals (such as ""Esprit"" or “Révoltes Logiques”). It left profound traces on contemporary political philosophy and philosophy in general. Its originality came from the fact that, while continuing the critique of ""totalitarianism"" from the previous decades, particularly under the influence of the democratic insurrections in the Socialist countries (notably the ""Solidarnosc"" movement in Poland) and the reception of Solzhenitsyn’s work, it was also trying to renew on a radical basis the idea of communism as libertarian and egalitarian invention. As a consequence, it proposed diverse insights into the vexed question of the articulation of communism and democracy, which could be compared with the current debates about ""assembly"" movements and post-capitalist democracy. 
 The class will read a number of texts from this debate, organizing them in the form of dialogues among the protagonists and trying to identify their points of heresy, in three successive clusters: “
Politics of Human Rights”
, “
Radical democracy and Gramsci’s legacy
” “
Communism without Community”
. Some transnational comparisons will be suggested.",Etienne Balibar,6:10pm,8:00pm,10180,Morningside,GU4627-20193-001,COMMUNISM OR DEMOCRACY?,French and Romance Philology,FREN,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Balibar,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529164355/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/GU4627-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20193FREN4627W001,SEMINAR

 Paris may be referred to as the capital of modernity, as 
the
 city of romance and pleasure, as the center of social and political powers, or as a privileged stage for crises and revolutions. Analyzing and researching the meanings of these diverse representations would expose students to key aspects of French and Francophone political, social, and cultural history. 
 This is a proposal for a course intended for students who, having completed their language requirement in French, would like to better their knowledge of French language and society. 
 It would offer students the opportunity to study representations of Paris over the centuries as a way to practice writing, reading, and conversation in French and as a way to deepen their understanding of French and Francophone cultures. 
 Materials for the course would include major literary texts as well as paintings, movies and popular songs, but also museum websites, local newspapers and local ads, brochures from retail and food malls, restaurant menus, postcards... such variety can be utilitarian and intellectually compelling at the same time.

FREN UN3883,French Civilization through Graphic Nove,"Prerequisites: FREN UN3405 or DUS permission 
 In France and Belgium, the 
bande dessinées
 [comic strips] and graphic novels are recognized as the ‘Ninth Art’, after cinema and visual arts. Popular and celebrated, the 
bande dessinées
 have their own museum in Angoulême, France. The medium has quickly evolved from its 19th-century roots in caricature to become a reflection of Francophone identity, history, and artistry. 
 While studies tend to focus on France and Belgium, this course moves beyond Europe into the history of France and its colonial empire. This is reflected in graphic novels from ""Tintin au Congo""– which is still at the core of controversies about the representations of Africa and Africans by European colonizers –  to ""Le Chat du Rabbin"" – which narrates the history of the Algerian colonization. After reading the graphic novels, students will watch and analyze several cinematographic adaptations. Thanks to a fellowship from the Center for Teaching and Learning, students will have the opportunity to write and design their own digital graphic novel.",Elsa Stephan,2:40pm,3:55pm,10307,Morningside,UN3883-20193-001,GRAPHIC NOVELS & CINEMA,French and Romance Philology,FREN,http://culpa.info/professors/14034,silver,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529164344/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/UN3883-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,FREN UN3405,TR,20193FREN3883W001,LECTURE
FREN UN3920,"""""""Blanchite"""" Thinking Whiteness in Fre","Prerequisites: FREN UN3405 or  
 What are the stakes of the emergence, in French, of a vocabulary to discuss racial formations adapted from US academic and activist discourse? How does the neutrality and invisibility associated with whiteness relate historically to French Republican universalism? How has the lack of a language to critically address whiteness, in particular, affected French and Francophone thought, politics and literature? This class examines the conceptualization and representations of racial whiteness in the French language and in French and Francophone literatures. Foregrounding a republican universalist rebuttal of identity politics and a post-WWII
denunciation of scientifically defined “race”, France has long perplexed foreign observers with such particularities as its restrictions on ethnic statistics and religious symbols. Yet a public debate on the meaning and implications of language used to discuss racial formations is currently underway. This class will reflect on the historical and contemporary significance of this shift in language in three ways. First, by interpreting current discussions of racial identities and whiteness; Second, by gaining a contextual understanding of how language addressing race in French has been shaped through the related histories of colonization, revolution, and migration. Finally by analyzing literary representations of racialized and racializing identities in French and Francophone literature.",Aline C Rogg,10:10am,11:25am,10360,Morningside,UN3920-20193-001,Thinking Whiteness in Fre,French and Romance Philology,FREN,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529164346/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FREN/UN3920-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,FREN UN3405,MW,20193FREN3920W001,LECTURE

The course will be structured into four “themes”:  1) Why food is a public health priority, 2) Evidence, causal inference and measurement and its role in understanding and designing public health research on food, 3) The food environment, and 4) Change agents and levers: individuals, policy, and politics in food and public health.  The course will use a systems thinking approach and systems thinking tools to examine and understand the interconnectedness of the social, economic, environmental, political and economic influences and consequences that affect food and public health.  This course partially fulfills the Science Requirement as a science course for non-science majors.",Anne Paxton,1:10pm,2:25pm,10572,Morningside,UN1100-20193-001,FOOD PUBLIC HEALTH & POLICY,Public Health,FSPH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529163815/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FSPH/UN1100-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,3,,MW,20193FSPH1100W001,LECTURE

It introduces the students to a number of authentic multimodal materials drawn from a range of sources which include films, literary texts, media, music etc. in order to better understand Greece’s current cultural, socio-economic, and political landscape. In doing so, it aims to foster transcultural understanding and intercultural competence, while further developing the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. Topics of discussion include language, gender equality, youth unemployment, education, queer identities, refugees, and the multilayered aspects of the crisis.

 This course examines the way particular spaces—cultural, urban, literary—serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on the themes of the 
polis
, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces—complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages—and ask: To what extent is meaning and cultural identity, site-specific? How central is the classical past in Western imagination? How have great metropolises such as Paris, Istanbul, and New York fashioned themselves in response to the allure of the classical and the advent of modern Greece? How has Greece as a specific site shaped the study of the Cold War, dictatorships, and crisis?",Dimitrios Antoniou,2:10pm,4:00pm,48713,Morningside,UN3935-20193-001,HELLENISM&THE; TOPOGRAPHIC IMAG,Classics,GRKM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529164918/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/GRKM/UN3935-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

We will investigate the question of land multi-confessional and multi-ethnic land empires (German, Russian, Habsburg, Ottoman), unfree labor, the making of the nation-state, World War Two, Cold War, communism, international women movements, decolonization, environmental politics, and the rise of illiberalism. Through the lens of culture, intellectual and social history, gender history, and history of science, we will explore the region’s historic liminality (bridge between ‘East’ and “West’) and its historic ties with the black Atlantic, Western Europe, as well as Ottoman, Soviet and South Asia.",Malgorzata Mazurek,2:10pm,4:00pm,13500,Morningside,GR8096-20193-001,THE OTHER EUROPE,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/13376,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170038/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8096-20193-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20193HIST8096G001,SEMINAR

It takes up the challenge posed by recent work on transnationalism and globalization by training graduate students in the theories and methodologies of a field that is emerging from older models of international and comparative scholarship to more recent approaches that highlight the movement of peoples, commodities, and ideas across borders. Students will encounter an eclectic mix of older and more recent transnational scholarship from fields including: African Diaspora Studies, Borderlands history, commodity chains studies, migration studies, among others. While the course will draw mostly from the discipline of history, it explicitly incorporates scholarship from other disciplines to encourage students to develop interdisciplinary approaches. The ultimate goal of the course is to prompt students to conceptualize the Americas as a broader American interconnected transborder space, rather than a hemisphere of different nation-states.",Frank Guridy,12:10pm,2:00pm,36523,Morningside,GR8121-20193-001,TRANSNATIONAL AMERICA,History,HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/13328,,2.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Andre_Guridy,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170042/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8121-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,4,,R,20193HIST8121G001,SEMINAR

Our effort will be to situate borderlands and frontiers not at the margins but t the center of the relationship between power and narrative, between empire and colony.

equality

What is the relationship between commitments to equality, on the one hand, and the preservation of difference on the other?

HIST GU4083,CRIME/PUNISHMENT/MIDDLE AGES,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 How a society defines crime, and how it deals with the criminals tells us a lot about the moral values, and the political and economic structure of that society, as well as its internal conflicts, superstitions, and fears. Often supposed to be a barbaric community of ignorant unruly men governed by greedy kings and popes, the medieval society in the popular culture is often an inspiration to the grotesque representations of violence and torture. Even an intellectual like Michel Foucault did not hesitate to advance a theory of medieval punishment, albeit a terribly wrong one, as one that focuses on the body and spectacle.  This course is designed to trace the origins of the modern criminal legislation and practices to the Middle Ages, some of which were jury trial, public persecution, and prisons. How did these practices come about, and under which social conditions? The focus of the course will be on violent crimes, such as murder, robbery, assault and suicide, and some particularly medieval crimes like sorcery, blasphemy and sodomy. The geographical scope will be limited to England, Italy and France. The class discussions are expected to take the form of collective brainstorming on how the political powers, social classes, cultural values, and religious beliefs affect the development of criminal legislation and institutions. Whenever possible the weekly readings will feature a fair share of medieval texts, including trial records, criminal laws, a manual for trying witches, and prison poetry.

HIST GU4121,MARGINS OF HISTORIOGRAPHY:,"Prerequisites: Reading knowledge of Turkish and/or French is desirable but not mandatory. Students who cannot read Turkish but are interested in enrolling are still encouraged to contact the course instructors. 
 This seminar aims to open a window onto historiographic traditions from overlooked contexts, with the argument that they broaden the field from much needed empirical and theoretical perspectives, while at the same time offer new venues to trigger critical thinking. Relying on their respective specialties, Professors Çelik and Şen will familiarize the students with the key works, trends, and names of the rigorous and essential scholarship in Ottoman-Turkish historiography that students of Ottoman-Turkish-Middle East history should be familiar with for their research and teaching. This exposure will also serve well history students in other areas in building comparative frameworks. Weekly discussion topics will range from economic and social history to history of science, urban history, and visual and literary culture, altogether coalescing into a multi-dimensional picture. Each week the instructors will present the major scholarly traditions and introduce key historians by intersecting them with the twentieth-century politico-cultural history. These presentations will be followed by the close discussion of assigned readings (mostly in English and to a limited extent in Turkish and French), with references to relevant historiographical traditions effective at the time on a global scale. Along the way, the students will be exposed to the work of legendary historians, among them Halil İnalcık and Ömer Lütfi Barkan, who examined exhaustive periods of Ottoman history, shifting from economic to social and cultural history and triangulating their arguments from different angles.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,36527,Morningside,GU4121-20193-001,OTTOMAN-TURKISH TRADITION,History,HIST,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529165916/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GU4121-20193-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20193HIST4121W001,SEMINAR

This seminar examines the history of government and private sector mechanisms used to export national ideals by and about women in order to enact American foreign policy agendas in the Cold War. To build their knowledge, students will be asked to parse primary materials in the context of secondary readings.

HIST GU4588,"RACE, DRUGS, AND INEQUALITY","Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 Through a series of secondary- and primary-source readings and research writing assignments, students in this seminar course will explore one of the most politically controversial aspects in the history of public health in the United States as it has affected peoples of color: intoxicating substances. Course readings are primarily historical, but sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists are also represented on the syllabus. The course's temporal focus - the twentieth century - allows us to explore the historical political and social configurations of opium, alcohol, heroin, cocaine, medical maintenance (methadone), the War on Drugs, the carceral state and hyperpolicing, harm reduction and needle/syringe exchange. This semester's principal focus will be on the origins and evolution of the set of theories, philosophies, and practices which constitute harm reduction. The International Harm Reduction Association/Harm Reduction International offers a basic, though not entirely comprehensive, definition of harm reduction in its statement, ""What is Harm Reduction?"" (http://www.ihra.net/what-is-harm-reduction): ""Harm reduction refers to policies, programmes and practices that aim to reduce the harms associated with the use of psychoactive drugs in people unable or unwilling to stop. The defining features are the focus on the prevention of harm, rather than on the prevention of drug use itself, and the focus on people who continue to use drugs.""[1] Harm reduction in many U.S. communities of color, however, has come to connote a much wider range of activity and challenges to the status quo. In this course we will explore the development of harm reduction in the United States and trace its evolution in the political and economic context race, urban neoliberalism, and no-tolerance drug war. The course will feature site visits to harm reduction organizations in New York City, guest lectures, and research/oral history analysis. This course has been approved for inclusion in both the African-American Studies and History undergraduate curricula (majors and concentrators). HIST W4588 will be open to both undergraduate and masters students.

Working from the notion that sport is “more than a game,” the class will examine the social, cultural and political impact of sports in a variety of American contexts in the past and present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the thrust of the course encourages students to consider sports in local, national, and transnational contexts.  The guiding questions of the course are: What is the relationship between sport and society? How does sport inform political struggles within and across national borders? How does sport reinforce and/or challenge social hierarchies? Can sport provide visions of alternative conceptions of the self and community? Throughout the semester, we will examine such topics as: the continuing political struggles surrounding mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup, the role of professional baseball in the rise and fall of Jim Crow segregation, the contradictory impact of high school football in Texas, the centrality of tennis to the women’s movement in the United States, and the role of sports in the growth of the city of Los Angeles.

HIST UN3019,"Rivers, Politics, and Power in the Unite","Rivers have played a central role in the creation of the modern United States whether through the trade networks they formed or the rise of the environmental movement in the twentieth century when stinking and burning rivers across the nation made it impossible to ignore the costs of economic progress. This seminar begins by defining rivers as a unique natural and historical process, followed by an exploration of rivers' connections to the rise of capitalism and nationalism, but the course focuses on the history of the twentieth century when rivers become important international borders, cities boomed, and citizens debated how to control rivers and the people who lived along them. While rivers such as the Columbia River have served to concentrate wealth and political power through government-built dams administered by an elite group of bureaucrats, others like many of the flood-prone rivers of the South have limited both economic development and landlord's ability to control people.

HROH UN5555,HUMAN RIGHTS & ORAL HISTORY,"This course will explore the possibilities and challenges of using oral history methods in the context of human rights work. Oral history can be a powerful means of documenting human rights abuses and conflict “from the bottom up,” contributing to individual and collective healing, and facilitating processes of conflict transformation and reconciliation. With its commitment to long-form, biographical interviewing and archival preservation, oral history is distinctive from, for example, the collection of testimony in a court of law or through a truth and reconciliation process. Conflict, violence, and human rights abuses are situated within the broader context of a life, a historical trajectory, a cultural setting. Oral history opens the space for voices and narratives that have been marginalized to challenge official narratives and complicate narrow accounts of conflict. Yet oral history also presents serious challenges in achieving these ideals—navigating sticky ethics in contexts that are heavily politicized; contending with the complex relationship between trauma, narrative, and memory; and confronting tensions between differing individual and collective needs for healing, restorative justice, and reconciliation. This course will explore these questions and related topics on the use of oral history in the context of human rights and conflict.",Zoe Westhof,2:10pm,4:30pm,63273,Morningside,UN5555-20193-001,HUM RGTS & ORAL HIST,Oral History,HROH,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170504/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HROH/UN5555-20193-001/,308A Lewisohn Hall,,"Barnard

HRTS GU4230,"REFUGEES, FORCED MIGR & DISPLACEMENT","Refugees, forced migration, and displacement: these subjects top the headlines of the world’s newspapers, not to mention our social media feeds. Over a million refugees have reached Europe’s shores in recent years, and conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere continue to force people to flee their homes. In the aftermath of the financial crisis and 9/11, politicians in the Global North have focused on borders: who crosses them and how. Walls are being erected. Referendums are being held. We are consumed with thorny questions about who gets to join our political communities. Today there are over 65 million refugees, displaced persons, and stateless persons in the world, represented at last summer’s Olympics by their own team for first the time, a testament to their increasing visibility on the world stage. Global forced displacement recently hit a historical high. And while numbers are increasing, solutions are still elusive. The modern refugee regime, the collection of laws and institutions designed to address the problems faced by refugees, has developed slowly over the course of the last 100 years, first in response to specific crises. That regime has been shaped by a changing geopolitical landscape. At the end of the Cold War, institutions in the field expanded their mandates and preferred solutions to the “problem” of refugees changed. And yet today many scholars and policy makers argue the regime is not fit for purpose. They point to the European refugee crisis as the latest case in point. Why? What went wrong and where? Can it be fixed? This course will largely focus on the issues of forced migration, displacement and refugees related to conflict, although this subject is inevitably intertwined with larger debates about citizenship and humanitarianism. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, this course will address both scholarly and policy debates. Utilizing human rights scholarship, it will draw on work in history that charts the evolution of institutions; legal scholarship that outlines international and domestic laws; work in political science that seeks to understand responses in a comparative perspective, and anthropological studies that address how refugees understand these institutions and their experiences of exile and belonging. These topics are not only the purview of those in the academy, however. Investigative journalists have most recently provided trenchant coverage of the world’s refugees, especially the current European crisis, where many have reported from the shores of the",Lara J Nettelfield,4:10pm,6:00pm,56984,Morningside,GU4230-20193-001,"REFUGEES, FORCED MIGR & DISPLA",Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170412/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/GU4230-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

Advocates are beginning to have some success in putting sexual orientation and gender identity on the agenda for inclusion in human rights instruments. But in many local and regional contexts, state-sanctioned homophobia is on the rise, from the official anti-gay stance of Russia featured during the Sochi Winter Games to the passage of Mississippi’s anti-gay bill and Uganda’s anti-homosexuality act. This course examines these trends in relation to strategies pursued by grassroots activists and NGOs and the legal issues they raise, including marriage and family rights, discrimination, violence, torture, sex classification, and asylum.

 This course will examine the tension between two contradictory trends in world politics. On the one hand, we have emerged from a century that has seen some of the most brutal practices ever perpetrated by states against their populations in the form of genocide, systematic torture, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Many of these abuses occurred after the Holocaust, even though the mantra ""never again"" was viewed by many as a pledge never to allow a repeat of these practices. Events in the new century suggest that these trends will not end anytime soon. At the same time, since the middle of the twentieth century, for the first time in human history there has been a growing global consensus that all individuals are entitled to at least some level of protection from abuse by their governments. This concept of human rights has been institutionalized through international law, diplomacy, international discourse, transnational activism, and the foreign policies of many states. Over the past two decades, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international tribunals have gone further than any institutions in human history to try to stem state abuses. This seminar will try to make sense of these contradictions.",Bruce L Cronin,10:10am,12:00pm,56986,Morningside,GU4950-20193-001,,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,http://localhost:8801/professors/2983,,13.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170421/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/GU4950-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

The course will be tailored to students’ interests, disciplinary backgrounds and research areas. The specific topics students will research and the methods they will employ will determine the substantive focus of readings. 
 During the course we will ask the following questions: ‘what is human rights research?,' 'how do you carry out research in an interdisciplinary field?', 'what distinguishes academic research from applied research and advocacy'? While answering these questions, you will become familiar with the literature on human rights methodologies, and you will engage in analysis and critical assessment of important human rights research literature. 
 In addition, the course gives a practical approach to research methodology. You will learn about a diverse set of methodologies, such as interviewing and focus groups, archival research, ethnographic and participant observation, interviewing focus groups, conducting online research; interpretive and non-empirical methods and basic quantitative methodologies to be employed in the study of human rights. As you learn about different methodological approaches, you will develop your own research project. 
 Scholars and practitioners in the field of human rights research will present their work and engage in discussions with students about their own research, challenges, successes and publication venues.

To understand this shift, we will consider questions of technology and imperialism, global circuits and knowledge transfer, the formulation of the modern episteme of “science,” the popularization and wonder of science, as well as commerce, politics and changing regimes of corporeality, in both the imperial and modern periods while placing close attention to the global context and transnational connections. In addition to getting a sense of the existing historiography on Chinese science, we will also be closely examining primary documents, pertinent theoretical writings, and comparative historiography. A central goal of the course is to explore different methodological approaches including history of science, translation studies, material culture, and global history. Reading ability in Classical Chinese and modern Chinese and facility in critical theory are all required.",Eugenia Lean,12:10pm,2:00pm,44533,Morningside,GR8884-20193-001,SCI/TECH-LATE IMPER/MOD,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,http://culpa.info/professors/1280,,17.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170154/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/GR8884-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

It follows a chronological order, introducing students to various realms of Japanese visual culture—from woodblock prints to film, anime, and manga—along with the historical contexts that they were shaped by, and in turn helped shape. Special attention will paid to the visual technologies of nation-building, war, and empire; to historical interactions between Japanese and Euro-American visual culture; to the operations of still versus moving images; and to the mass production of visual commodities for the global marketplace. Students who take the course will emerge not only with a better understanding of Japan’s modern historical experience, but also with a more discerning eye for the ways that images convey meaning and offer access to the past.",Gregory Pflugfelder,4:10pm,6:00pm,44516,Morningside,UN3871-20193-001,MODERN JAPAN: IMAGES AND WORDS,East Asian Languages and Cultures,HSEA,http://culpa.info/professors/1262,silver,25.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170136/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HSEA/UN3871-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

The readings include both primary sources (in translation) and secondary works. Our key concerns will be the political, cultural and theological encounters of varied communities, the growth of cities and urban spaces, networks of trade and migrations and the development of both local and cosmopolitan cultures across Southern Asia. The survey will begin with early dynasties of the classical period and then turn to the subsequent formation of various Perso-Turkic polities, including the development and growth of hybrid political cultures such as those of Vijayanagar and the Mughals. The course also touches on Indic spiritual and literary traditions such as Sufi and Bhakti movements.

While machines have started to replace some trading positions such as market making in very liquid instruments, there is still a growing need for structuring where derivative instruments are used to help companies and institutions to manage their risks. 
 Structuring skills are also in demand at Corporate Treasuries where the emphasis is on using derivatives to manage various financial exposures such as interest rates, Foreign Exchange (FX), or commodities etc. Treasuries of companies usually do not engage in developing pricing modules but apply FE techniques to their hedging, funding, and investment activities to ensure that they receive the best price from the market. Moreover, the accounting treatment of derivatives is also of utmost importance for public companies as it impacts their income statement and ROE and ROA.  
 Similarly, all major banks and investment houses have teams of Derivatives Marketers and structures who help companies and customers in developing and selecting the optimum risk management tools.

IEOR E4711,GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS,"Prerequisites: Refer to course syllabus. 
 
Fall: Global Capital Markets, taught by Professor S. Dastidar.
 This course is an introduction to capital markets and investments. It provides an overview of financial markets and teaches you tools for asset valuation that will be very useful in your future career. The extract below is from last year. While I was keen to have similar content, the class complained last year that the topics 2 and 3 were too esoteric for them. Based on what the class feels, I am probably going to replace it with general content on equities (i.e. replace 2 and 3 with 4). This course then becomes very similar to Capital Markets and Investments offered by the Business School. We will cover: 1. The pricing of fixed income securities (treasury markets, interest rate swaps, futures etc) 2. Discussions on topics in credit, foreign exchange, sovereign and securitized markets (we may drop this) 3. Private markets - private equity and hedge funds, etc. (we may drop this) 4. We shall spend some time on equity markets and their derivatives, time permitting. We will aim to take a hands-on approach in this course. The course is somewhat quantitative in nature; you should be prepared to work with data and spreadsheets. Programming is not required. Nevertheless, this is a basic foundations course, and does not assume much prior knowledge in finance. Consequently, the course emphasizes a few cardinal principles while getting into some institutional detail. The word ""Global"" in the title implies that the concepts we discuss are relevant to all geographies; we will rarely get into specifics of any particular region.",Siddhartha Ghosh Dastidar,7:10pm,9:40pm,10274,Morningside,E4711-20193-001,,Industrial Engineering and Operations Research,IEOR,http://culpa.info/professors/7069,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529172111/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/IEOR/E4711-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

ITAL GU4395,NOVEL IN ITALY BET 1950-2000,"The course examines some of the most important novels that belong to Italy's period of major social and economic transformations. Only after WWII Italy finally becomes a modern nation, i.e. a republic based on truly universal suffrage, and an industrialized country. Such accelerated progress, though,causes deep social instability and mobility which obviously results in heavy psychological pressures on the people: adaptation becomes crucial and inevitable. Fiction therefore resumes the task to represent such awkwardness of integration into a modern bourgeois society that, contrarily to its European and American counterpart, is extremely tentative and insecure per se, since it's political identity has extremely precarious grounds. Among other authors, primary readings include Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's The Leopard and Italo Calvinos's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.

: This course, entirely taught in Italian, introduces you to Medieval and early modern Italian literature. It will give you the opportunity to test your ability as a close-reader and discover unusual and fascinating texts that tell us about the polycentric richness of the Italian peninsula. We will read poems, tales, letters, fiction and non-fiction, travel writings and political pamphlets. The great “Three Crowns” - Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio -  as well as renowned Renaissance authors such as Ludovico Ariosto and Niccolò Machiavelli, will show us the main path to discover Italian masterpieces and understand the European Renaissance. But we will also explore China with Marco Polo and the secrets of the Medieval soul diving into the mystical poems by Jacopone da Todi. We will study parody and laughter through the “poesia giocosa” (parodic poetry) by Cecco Angiolieri and the legacy of Humanism through the letters of Poggio Bracciolini. This first overview will allow you to explore Italian literature from its complex and multicultural beginnings to its diffusion across Europe during the Renaissance.",Steven J Baker,11:40am,12:55pm,98159,Morningside,UN3333-20193-001,,Italian,ITAL,http://localhost:8801/professors/5247,gold,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529173015/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ITAL/UN3333-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

ITAL UN3341,Art Itineraries: Italian through Art,"Prerequisites: (ITAL UN2102) or (ITAL UN2121) Students must have completed Intermediate level Italian language proficiency. 
 The course, designed for students who have mastered the grammatical structure of the language, will give the students the opportunity to improve their language skills and discover Italian art from Middle Ages to the second half of twentieth century. The works of the artists will be studied and discussed with the intent of developing knowledge of the main features of artistic and cultural movements and of the appropriate vocabulary and terminology to describe and talk about them. A particular emphasis will be put to oral and written productions: various kinds of texts and genres will be practiced (description, narration, critical analysis). Students will learn how to describe and interpret a work of art, examine the main characteristics and the techniques used by the artists and will be able to look for themes recurring in the artistic productions. The artists covered during the course will be introduced along the lines of their unique artistic, historical and socio-cultural relevance through different sources: images, scholarly essays, literature, video and music.  Two visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to CIMA (Center for Modern Italian Art) will be organized.

ITAL UN3660,Terrorism in Literature & Film,"How does the experience of terrorism impact artworks both aesthetically and thematically? And how do artworks that thematize terrorism reveal underlying issues and inner dynamics of contemporary society? In this interdisciplinary course, we will treat novels and films that use the theme of terrorism as a rich resource for understanding the consequences of terroristic violence and the trauma it produces at an individual and social level. To do so, we will compare the cultural reflections on the attack on the Twin Towers in Manhattan on 9/11 to Italy's years of lead, which was the most disruptive case of domestic terrorism in a Western democracy prior to 2001. We will explore issues such as: the representation of the body of the terrorist and his/her victims; memory and trauma; women's role in or vis a vis terroristic associations; children's perspective on terroristic violence; terrorism and its effect on the nuclear family; the perspective of the Other and postcolonialism; martyrdom and sacrifice. As a result of our close analysis of films and novels on terrorism, we will be able to discover the specificity of 9/11 and the Italian years of lead, and the way in which art not only works as a therapeutic device, but also as analytic tool for political change.  This is thus a course that would also be of interest for students of Comparative Literature, Film and Media Studies, English, and Political Science.

Haitian Kreyòl is spoken by Haiti’s population of nine million and by about one million Haitians in the U.S. Including over 190,000 in the New York City area. In fact, New York City has the second largest population of Kreyòl Speakers after Port--â€au--â€Prince, Haiti’s capital. Through this course, you will develop introductory speaking, reading, and writing skills. We use a communicative approach, balanced with grammatical and phonetic techniques. Classroom and textbook materials are complemented by work with film, radio, and especially music (konpa, rasin, twoubadou, rap, raga, levanjil, vodou tradisyonèl, etc.), as well as with visits to city museums and institutions related to Haiti.

LING UN3102,Endangered Languages in the Global City:,"Of the world’s estimated 7,000 languages – representing migrations and historical developments thousands of years old – the majority are oral, little-documented, and increasingly endangered under the onslaught of global languages like English. This course will take the unprecedented, paradoxical linguistic capital of New York City as a lens for examining how immigrants form communities in a new land, how those communities are integrated into the wider society, and how they grapple with linguistic and cultural loss. Interdisciplinary with an experiential learning component, the course will focus on texts, materials, encounters, and fieldwork with three of the city’s newest and least-studied indigenous immigrant communities (indigenous Latin Americans, Himalayans, and Central Asians).
Indigeneity, though often invisible or perceived as marginal in global cities like New York, is in fact pervasive and fundamental. Cities now constitute a crucial site for understanding migration and cultural change, with language a vehicle for culture. Studying cultures only in situ (i.e. in their homelands) risks missing a crucial dimension. Students will be immersed in stateless, oral, immigrant cultures while also gaining a hands-on critical understanding of language endangerment and urban sociolinguistic research, first through field experiences and guest speakers (Endangered Language Alliance partners) and then by going out together into communities to work on projects in small teams.
The Endangered Language Alliance (ELA), where the instructor is Co-Director, was formed as a non-profit research institute in 2010 as a forum for researchers, community members, activists, artists, and other New Yorkers to come together to support indigenous and minority languages. ELA’s video recordings provide first-hand testimony of endangered languages in the global city – in indigenous languages with English translation – available in few other places. Those texts will be central to this course, supplemented by the new,first-ever, detailed language map of New York City being produced by ELA.",Ross Perlin,4:10pm,5:25pm,10171,Morningside,UN3102-20193-001,ENDANGERED LANGUAGES,Slavic Languages,LING,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perlin,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529175245/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LING/UN3102-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20193LING3102W001,LECTURE

The first course will focus primarily on methodological and theoretical problems in the fields broadly described as historical social sciences - which study historical trends, and political, economic and social institutions and processes. The course will start with discussions regarding the origins of the modern social sciences and the disputes about the nature of social science knowledge. In the next section it will focus on definitions and debates about the concept of modernity. It will go on to analyses of some fundamental concepts used in modern social and historical analyses: concepts of social action, political concepts like state, power, hegemony, democracy, nationalism; economic concepts like the economy, labor, market, capitalism, and related concepts of secularity/secularism, representation, and identity. The teaching will be primarily through close reading of set texts, followed by a discussion.

MDES GR6631,Media Materialisms,"This graduate seminar offers a survey of debates on materiality and object-oriented ontologies that are currently revitalizing the humanities and social sciences. How does the physical world of objects and things affect our social and perceptual reality? Is it possible to imagine a world with the non-human at its center? Should we learn to study a “thing in itself” or is it better to approach matter as always-already entangled in networks and relations? In this interdisciplinary seminar we will keep media objects and contexts at the center of our study and travel through a long history of critical interest in materialism. The seminar begins with foundational debates from Marx to McLuhan and gradually moves through modules on materialism as understood vis-a-vis things, actors, relations, bodies, images, infrastructures, aesthetics, and ecologies. Weekly sessions combine historical and philosophical approaches to media forms and their material lives. A special emphasis is placed on complicating dominant disciplinary frameworks with theories and case studies from the South and insights from feminist theory.

Through an encounter with the diversity of research underway in MESAAS, participants learn to engage with work anchored in different regions and disciplines and discover or develop what is common in the department's post-disciplinary methods of inquiry. Since the community is relatively small, it is expected that all post-M.Phil. students in residence will join the colloquium. Post M.Phil. students from other departments may request permission to join the colloquium, but places for non-MESAAS students will be limited.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, colonial powers increasingly provided more structure and organization to these policies of relocation and internment in the Americas, Africa, and East Asia. This course provides a social history of civilian internment and mass murder from late-19th century colonial cases to World War II. 
 Through case studies of the Spanish-Cuban war, the South African War, the Philippines-American War, the genocide of the Herrero and Nama in Southwest Africa, the Armenian Genocide, and the Holocaust, the course traces the evolution of the concentration camp from a counter-insurgency strategy in wartime to a weapon of mass murder.

MDES UN2650,GANDHI & HIS INTERLOCUTORS,"Gandhi is in two senses an extraordinary figure: he was the most important leader of anti-imperialist movements in the twentieth century; yet, his ideas about modernity, the state, the industrial economy, technology, humanity’s place in nature, the presence of God – were all highly idiosyncratic, sometimes at odds with the main trends of modern civilization. How did a man with such views come to have such an immense effect on history? In some ways, Gandhi is an excellent entry into the complex history of modern India – its contradictions, achievements, failures, possibilities. This course will be primarily a course on social theory, focusing on texts and discursive exchanges between various perceptions of modernity in India. It will have two parts: the first part will be based on reading Gandhi’s own writings; the second, on the writings of his main interlocutors. It is hoped that through these exchanges students will get a vivid picture of the intellectual ferment in modern India, and the main lines of social and political thought that define its intellectual culture. The study in this course can be followed up by taking related courses in Indian political thought, or Indian politics or modern history.

MDES UN3046,"Religion Mod SAsia:Concepts, Histories","Instead of taking our understanding of ‘religion’ for granted, this course explores precisely that concept and its history. It asks: is religion a universal category that has remained unchanged across time periods and in all societies? Are the relations between various ‘religions’ equal? How do debates around the question of religion inform other categories in our social life - race, gender, community history? Mainstream Western theories tend to focus on faith, scriptures, holy texts and rituals as universal components of all religions. However, a body of critical scholarship, demonstrates how the various orientalist and colonial encounters between the west and the non-west produces ‘religion’ as a universal, constant which can be found in all societies. This course will explore both the mainstream and the critical scholarship on religion, as well as examine what role this critical re-formulation of religion plays in questions of race, gender, caste, culture, secularism and history-writing in South Asia.",Sayori Ghoshal,12:10pm,2:00pm,10609,Morningside,UN3046-20193-001,RELIGION IN MODERN S ASIA,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190623103224/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/MDES/UN3046-20193-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20193MDES3046W001,SEMINAR

POLS BC3025,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES,"Political parties have evoked widespread scorn in the U.S. since the founding era; and yet, they arose almost immediately and have endured for over two centuries. In this course, we will examine why parties formed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major party.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties are, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over time as organizations, in the electorate, and in government. 
 Topics will include the presidential nomination process from the founding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season, the life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political parties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward. 
 Throughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How much is too much? We will address these difficult questions, among others, in this broad survey of American political parties.",Katherine L Krimmel,10:10am,11:25am,09164,Barnard College,BC3025-20193-001,,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,http://culpa.info/professors/13343,,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190412233709/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/POLS/BC3025-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

RUSS GR6011,"LITERATURE, POLITICS AND TRADITION AFTER","The seminar’s main goal is to introduce graduate students to the wealth of Russian literature from the period of the late 1950s to the late 1980s, i.e. since Stalin’s death to Gorbachev’s Perestroika. The process of de-Stalinization triggered radical transformations of the entire Soviet discursive field resulting in the emergence of several warring cultural formations, each of which had its own vision of Russia’s history and culture. Since literature traditionally played a leading role in Russian culture, it became the field where main political and historical conflicts took place. From this perspective, we will discuss main tendencies in Russian literature that developed simultaneously, albeit on parallel courses, during these years: literature published in Soviet press and literature distributed through unofficial channels. The latter segment of literature frequently transformed into a third parallel stream under discussion: literature of emigration. 
 We will look at literature of this period not as the evidence of disintegration of Soviet culture, but rather as a birthplace of various aesthetic and discursive formations that continue to affect Russian culture until the present moment. We will pay special attention to the discourses of historical trauma, various attempts to revive modernism and avant-garde, nationalist discourse as a paradoxical modernist utopia (or rather, retrotopia, to use Zygmunt Bauman’s term), and postmodernism. Students will explore these literary trends along with Western and Russian scholarship and criticism discussing revolutionary aesthetic and cultural processes unfolding underneath a seemingly motionless surface of late socialism.",Mark Leiderman,4:10pm,6:00pm,13407,Morningside,GR6011-20193-001,LIT POL TRAD AFTER STALIN,Slavic Languages,RUSS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190523163955/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/RUSS/GR6011-20193-001/,709 Hamilton Hall,,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

SOCI GR6081,Social Movements Dynamics,"Social movements are sustained challenges against authorities that aim at reforming or revolutionizing dominant institutions, changing public opinion, or transforming personal behavior. This seminar focuses on theoretical perspectives and empirical research on the dynamics of broad-based social and political movements. The aim is to evaluate dominant conceptual models that have animated the study of social movements and contention across time and space, with an emphasis on the interplay of organizational, political and cultural processes. Emphasis is on macro- and meso-level dynamics, with little attention to the microfoundations of collective action and movement mobilization. A second objective is to gain some familiarity with common methodological approaches in social movement analysis and evaluate new theoretical and empirical directions in social movement research. Empirical cases are drawn mainly from the U.S. but you will have the opportunity to explore a wider range of cases in your independent work for the course. 
 This elective seminar is intended for graduate students in sociology who want to gain basic familiarity with key debates and approaches in the subfield of collective action and social movements, which has grown exponentially in the wake of the 1960s protest wave that animated a paradigm shift in the field. Participants can use the course as an opportunity to develop a research proposal or field statement or to explore a theoretical or empirical puzzle by diving deeper into a single case study.",Debra Minkoff,12:00pm,2:00pm,42401,Morningside,GR6081-20193-001,SOCIAL MOVEMENTS DYNAMICS,Sociology,SOCI,http://culpa.info/professors/2812,,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190427164636/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/GR6081-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,4,,R,20193SOCI6081G001,SEMINAR

SOCI GR6100,EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SEMINAR,"Prerequisites: Completion of year 1 of the graduate program in Sociology. Sociology PhD students from year 2 onward only.  
 Writing research articles for journals is a lot of intellectual fun … but it’s also a rather demanding craft. This seminar prepares you for the challenge. It will help you to find an interesting question, a way to answer it, and a mode of communicating this to fellow sociologists in a way that they might find worth paying attention to. (Even) more pragmatically, the goal of this year-long seminar is to help you writing a quantitative research paper that will ultimately be suitable for presentation at a conference and submission to a journal, building valuable research and professional skills and, in many cases, providing you with a jump-start for your dissertation research. 
 As crucial milestones in the process, you will: 
 • Develop a theoretical argument that motivates hypotheses 
 • Identify a data set that can be used to test those hypotheses 
 • Format and analyze the data to draw conclusions about your hypotheses 
 • Interpret your results 
 • Present your argument and findings in a precise and compelling narrative form 
 In short, the course is partly about theory, and how it can be used to specify hypotheses and measures; partly about methods, and how data can be analyzed appropriately to test hypotheses; and partly about the craft of sociological writing, and how good writing can be used to make a clear and compelling case for your research. 
 Students entering their second year of graduate school are expected to be familiar with the main theoretical traditions in Sociology, have developed areas of substantive interest, be acquainted with the basic methodology of the social sciences, have an applied knowledge of statistical techniques, and be familiar with datasets they could possibly work with. The “Empirical seminar” is not intended to offer training in any of these areas—and this particular instructor’s capacity to provide advise on statistical techniques is rather limited indeed. Please consult with other faculty for more technical advice necessary to bring your research to fruition or make use of the statistical consulting service offered elsewhere at Columbia.",Andreas Wimmer,4:10pm,6:00pm,42279,Morningside,GR6100-20193-001,EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SEM,Sociology,SOCI,,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Wimmer,https://web.archive.org///web/20190427164646/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/GR6100-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,Graduate School of Arts and Science,4,,M,20193SOCI6100G001,SEMINAR

SOCI GU4411,Politics and Society in Central Eastern,"The goal of the course is to discuss different approaches to the study of developmental pathways in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in a broad historical perspective drawing on various approaches from political science, sociology and economic history.  Students participating in the seminars will get an overview on the various approaches to explaining divergence in political, social and economic developments between the Eastern and Western parts of Europe, and within the region. The course aims to establish a dialogue between three types of scholarships: one dealing with the pre-regime change developmental pathways in the region, another dealing with factors that could account for persistent post-communist and post- enlargement developmental divergence and a third one that deals with issues of backwardness and core-periphery relations in transnational and global perspective. 
  The course starts with a discussion of broad historical perspectives on East-West divergence in Europe. The second bloc deals with the various great transformations in the region: the remaking of states, polities and economies. The third bloc is devoted to the discussion of the transnationalization of states and economies in the region. Finally, the forth bloc deals with hybrid regimes and problems of democratic backsliding in the region.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,10178,Morningside,GU4411-20193-001,PLTCS&SCTY; CTR-EST EUROPE,Sociology,SOCI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190427164722/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/GU4411-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,,3,,R,20193SOCI4411W001,SEMINAR
SOCI GU4600,MYSTIFICATIONS OF SOCIAL REALITY,"The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were marked by the discovery of a new object of systematic inquiry in addition to Nature and the Individual:  Society.  First Economics, then Anthropology, Sociology, and Political Science developed strikingly new understandings of the actions, beliefs, and institutional arrangements of men and women 
in society
, which were seen as obeying regular laws not derivable from, or reducible to, either the laws of nature or the laws of individual behavior.  But these new disciplines, which came to be called the Social Sciences, were different from their predecessors in one fundamental and centrally important way:  They revealed the study of society, and indeed society itself, to be mystified, ideologically encoded, shaped and distorted by the interests and beliefs of men and women 
even though those living in society or studying it often were oblivious of this fact
.
 
 
            In this course we shall read in depth a series of texts by authors who explored the ideological mystifications of social reality in their disciplines.  The goal of the course is not merely to inform students of these authors and their ideas but to strengthen the ability of students to understand their own involvement in, indeed complicity in, ideological mystification.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,42275,Morningside,GU4600-20193-001,MYSTIFICATIONS OF SOCIAL,Sociology,SOCI,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190427164727/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/SOCI/GU4600-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

SPAN UN3362,WHAT IS IDEOLOGY,"The populism that arguably defined twentieth century politics in Argentina challenged liberal and left wing thinkers to reconsider the cultural imaginaries, habits, and organizational structures moving the masses. Irreducible to either doctrine or illusion, ideology would become the center of politics. The issue of what it is and how it works would likewise assume a pivotal place in both literature and social thought. This course will examine Argentinean narrative, film, political rhetoric, and social theory from the 1930s through the 1970s in order to explore the tension and intersection between two different approaches to the question of ideology. The first, which derives from moral and political philosophy, presumes that individuals are inherently free and asks why, given this condition, we would submit to the unjust authority of others. The second, which derives from the Marxist tradition, argues that ideas emerge from an exploitative social division of labor and yet blind the exploited (and exploiters) to these same material conditions. Combining these two approaches, the texts surveyed ponder the fact that while the genesis of our ideas and customs may be social and objective, they are only actualized and made relevant in the highly subjective realm of politics. We will study notions such as class and class-consciousness, the revolutionary party, the leader, populism, and madness in the work of Antonio Gramsci, Roberto Arlt, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Domingo PerĂ³n, Ernesto Laclau, and Rodolfo Walsh, among others. Readings and discussions will be in Spanish.

WMST GR8010,ADVANCED TOPICS,"What is the relationship between homoeroticism and homosociality?How does this relationship form conceptions of gender and sexuality in ways that might be historically unfamiliar and culturally or regionally specific?We pursue these questions through the lens of friendship and its relationship to ideas and expressions of desire, love, and loyalty in pre-modern times.We begin by considering the intellectual basis of the modern idea of friendship as a private, personal relationship, and trace it back to earlier times when it was often a public relationship of social and political significance.Some of these relationships were between social equals, while many were unequal forms (like patronage) that could bridge social, political or parochial differences.Thinking through the relationships and possible distinctions between erotic love, romantic love and amity (love between friends), we will draw on scholarly works from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, particularly philosophy, sociology, political theory, literature, history, and art history.We will attend to friendshipâ€™s work in constituting, maintaining and challenging various social and political orders in a variety of Asian contexts (West, Central, South and East Asian), with reference to scholarship on European contexts.Primary source materials will include philosophy, religious manuals, autobiographies, popular love stories, heroic epics, mystical poetry, mirror for princes, paintings, material objects of exchange, and architectural monuments.",Mana Kia,2:10pm,4:00pm,63381,Morningside,GR8010-20193-001,SIGNIFICANT OTHERS,Women's and Gender Studies,WMST,http://culpa.info/professors/12754,,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190623103245/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WMST/GR8010-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Engineering and Applied Science: Graduate

WRIT GU4310,"WITNESS,RECORD,DOCUMENT","Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 This seminar takes up the terms witness, record, and document as nouns and verbs. What is poetry of witness? Documentary poetry? Poetry as (revisionist ) historical record? What labor and what ethical, political, and aesthetic considerations are required of poets who endeavor to witness, record, or document historical events or moments of trauma? How is this approach to poetry informed by or contributing to feminist theories, aesthetic innovation, and revisionist approaches to official histories? Course materials include: 1) essays that explore the poetics and politics of ""poetry of witness"" or ""documentary poetry""; 2) a range of contemporary American Poetry that has been classified as or has productively challenged these categories; 3) and audio, video, and photographic projects on which poets have collaborated. Our encounters with this work will be guided by and grounded in conversations about ideas of ""truth,"" ""text,"" the power relations of ""documentation,"" and issues of language and representation in poetry.  We will also critically examine the formal (rhyme, rhythm, diction, form, genre, point of view, imagery, etc.) and philosophical components and interventions of the work we study and create.",Deborah Paredez,10:10am,12:00pm,46840,Morningside,GU4310-20193-001,WITNESSRECORDDOCUMENT,Writing,WRIT,http://culpa.info/professors/13473,gold,2.0,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Paredez,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170235/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/GU4310-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

WRIT UN2110,APPROACHES TO THE SHORT STORY,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 The modern short story has gone through many transformations, and the innovations of its practitioners have often pointed the way for prose fiction as a whole. The short story has been seized upon and refreshed by diverse cultures and aesthetic affiliations, so that perhaps the only stable definition of the form remains the famous one advanced by Poe, one of its early masters, as a work of fiction that can be read in one sitting. Still, common elements of the form have emerged over the last century and this course will study them, including Point of View, Plot, Character, Setting, and Theme. John Hawkes once famously called these last four elements the ""enemies of the novel,"" and many short story writers have seen them as hindrances as well. Hawkes later recanted, though some writers would still agree with his earlier assessment, and this course will examine the successful strategies of great writers across the spectrum of short story practice, from traditional approaches to more radical solutions, keeping in mind how one period's revolution - Hemingway, for example - becomes a later era's mainstream or ""common-sense"" storytelling mode. By reading the work of major writers from a writer's perspective, we will examine the myriad techniques employed for what is finally a common goal: to make readers feel. Short writing exercises will help us explore the exhilarating subtleties of these elements and how the effects created by their manipulation or even outright absence power our most compelling fictions.",Juliane E Buntin,4:10pm,6:00pm,46921,Morningside,UN2110-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170330/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN2110-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

 The seminar provides exposure to the varieties of nonfiction with readings in its principal genres: reportage, criticism and commentary, biography and history, and memoir and the personal essay.  A highly plastic medium, nonfiction allows authors to portray real events and experiences through narrative, analysis, polemic or any combination thereof.  Free to invent everything but the facts, great practitioners of nonfiction are faithful to reality while writing with a voice and a vision distinctively their own.  To show how nonfiction is conceived and constructed, class discussions will emphasize the relationship of content to form and style, techniques for creating plot and character under the factual constraints imposed by nonfiction, the defining characteristics of each author's voice, the author's subjectivity and presence, the role of imagination and emotion, the uses of humor, and the importance of speculation and attitude.  Written assignments will be opportunities to experiment in several nonfiction genres and styles.",Elianna Kan,4:10pm,6:00pm,46816,Morningside,UN2211-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170340/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN2211-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

 Some of the greatest works of fiction are narrated by characters who have become unhinged from the norms of society. They may stand apart from the mainstream because of willful eccentricity, madness, even social disgrace, but in each case their alienation provides them with a unique perspective, one that allows the reader to see the world they describe without the dulling lens of convention. We will explore what authors might gain by narrating their works from an ""outsider"" viewpoint, and we will study how the peculiar form and structure of these books reflects the modernist impulse in literature. This is a seminar designed for fiction writers, so we will spend time talking about not only the artistic merits of these books, but also about how the authors, who include Dostoevsky, Knut Hamsun, Jean Rhys, Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Samuel Beckett and Amos Tutuola, achieve their specific effects. Over the course of the semester, we will use these texts as a springboard for writing original fiction.",,6:10pm,8:00pm,46857,Morningside,UN3114-20193-001,ECCENTRICS & OUTSIDERS,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170420/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3114-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

WRIT UN3116,STORY COLLECTION AS ART FORM,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 How do story collections happen?  Are they just anthologies of the best (or the only) stories a writer has produced in a given time period?  How do you decide what goes in it, and how do you organize it, and how many do you need?  In this class we're going to read a bunch of short story collections, in a variety of genres and modes.  Rigorous literary, aesthetic, and critical analysis of individual stories will here be linked to macro-level questions such as: What makes a ""linked collection"" different from a novel?  What are some of the ways that a ""linked"" collection forges its links-- character, theme, place, narrative strategy, mood, etc.?  How does a writer handle her recurring themes without falling into repetition?  How does the story collection compare with (or relate to) self-anthologizing forms in other disciplines: the poetry collection, the record album, the solo exhibition? Books include: The Piazza Tales by Herman Melville; Red Cavalry by Isaac Babel (Peter Constantine trans.); Super Flat Times by Matthew Derby; Normal People Don't Live Like This by Dylan Landis; The Train to Lo Wu by Jess Row; Don't Let Me Be Lonely by Claudia Rankine; Birds of America by Lorrie Moore; The Emigrants by W. G. Sebald; Criers and Kibbitzers, Kibbitzers and Criers by Stanley Elkin; The Actual Adventures of michael Missing by Michael Hickins; and A Personal Anthology by Jorge Luis Borges.",Jordan R Kisner,12:10pm,2:00pm,46855,Morningside,UN3116-20193-001,STORY COLLECTION AS ART,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170425/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3116-20193-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard

WRIT UN3120,THE CRAFT OF WRITING DIALOGUE,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Departmental approval NOT required. 
 Whether texting, chatting, conversing, speechifying, recounting, confiding, gossiping, tweeting, praying, interviewing, exhorting, pitching, scheming, lecturing, nagging or begging, humans love to talk, and readers love narratives that contain dialogue.  Good dialogue makes characters and scenes feel real and alive.  Great dialogue reveals characters' fears, desires and quirks, forwards the narrative's plot and dramatic tension, and often contains subtext.  In this course, we'll read different kinds of novels and stories -- from noir to horror to sci-fi to realistice drama to comic romp -- that implement various types of dialogue effectively, and we'll study how to do it.  We'll read essays by masters that explain techniques for writing great dialogue, and we'll practice writing different styles of dialogue ourselves.  Coursework will consist of reading, in-class exercises, and two short creative assignments.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,46808,Morningside,UN3120-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170430/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3120-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

WRIT UN3210,THE MODERN ARTS WRITER,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
 We will examine the lineaments of critical writing. A critic blends the subjective and objective in complex ways. A critic must know the history of an artwork, its past, while placing it on the contemporary landscape and contemplating its future. A single essay will analyze, argue, describe, reflect, and interpret. And, since examining a work of art also means examining oneself, the task includes a willingness to probe one's own assumptions. The best critics are engaged in a conversation -- a dialogue, a debate -- with changing standards of taste, with their audience, with their own convictions and emotions. The best criticism is part of a larger cultural conversation. It spurs readers to ask questions rather than accept answers about art and society. We will read essays that consider six art forms: literature; film; music (classical, jazz and popular); theatre and performance; visual art; and dance. At the term's end, students will consider essays that examine cultural boundaries and divisions: the negotiations between popular and high art; the aesthetic of cruelty; the post-modern blurring of and between artist, critic and fan. The reading list will include such writers as Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, Elizabeth Hardwick (literature); James Agee, Manny Farber, Zadie Smith (film); G.B. Shaw, Willa Cather, Ralph Ellison, Lester Bangs, Ellen Willis (music); Eric Bentley, Mary McCarthy, C.L.R. James (theatre); Leo Steinberg, Frank O'Hara, Ada Louise Huxtable, Maggie Nelson (visual art); Edwin Denby, Arlene Croce, Elizabeth Kendall, Mindy Aloff (dance); Susan Sontag, Anthony Heilbut, John Jeremiah Sullivan (cultural criticism).",Margo L Jefferson,2:10pm,4:00pm,46754,Morningside,UN3210-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,http://localhost:8801/professors/2096,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170440/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3210-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

WRIT UN3211,THE LYRIC ESSAY,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT needed. 
 While nonfiction is perhaps known for its allegiance to facts and logic in the stalwart essay form, the genre conducts its own experiments, often grouped under the term ""lyric essays.""  Lyric essays are sometimes fragmentary, suggestive, meditative, inconclusive; they may glance only sidelong at their subject, employ the compression of poetry, and perform magic tricks in which stories slip down blind alleys, discursive arguments dissolve into ellipses, and narrators disappear altogether.  Lyric essayists blend a passion for the actual with innovative forms, listening deeply to the demands of each new subject.  In this course, students will map the terrain of the lyric essay, work in which writers revise nonfiction traditions such as: coherent narrative or rhetorical arcs; an identifiable, transparent, or stable narrator; and the familiar categories of memoir, personal essay, travel writing, and argument.  Students will read work that challenges these familiar contours, including selections from Halls of Fame by John D'Agata, Don't Let Me Be Lonely by Claudia Rankine, Plainwater by Anne Carson, Letters to Wendy by Joe Wenderoth, The Body and One Love Affair by Jenny Boully, Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, Running in the Family by Michael Ondaatje, Neck Deep and Other Predicaments by Ander Monson.  They can expect to read essays selected from The Next American Essay edited by John D'Agata and In Short: A Collection of Brief Creative Nonfiction edited by Judith Kitchen and Mary Paumier Jones, as well as essays by Paul Metcalf, David Foster Wallace, Sherman Alexie, Michael Martone, and Sei Shonagon.  The course will be conducted seminar style, with close reading, lecture, and classroom discussion.  The students will be expected to prepare a written study and comments for class on a particular book/author/issue.  They will also complete writing exercises and their own lyric essay(s), one of which we will discuss as a class.  Their final project will be a collection of their creative work accompanied by an essay discussing their choices.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,46922,Morningside,UN3211-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170445/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3211-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

WRIT UN3216,TRUTH & FACTS,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
 As writers of literary nonfiction, we seek to articulate the truth about people, personal experiences, and events.  But how do those pesky facts figure in?  Demarcating the boundaries of reasonable artistic license is an ongoing debate among writers, editors, fact-checkers, and audiences.  Can changing chronologies and identifying details help the writer arrive at a deeper truth about her subject?  Or are the facts intractable?  Where do we draw the line between fabrication and artistry?  Is there any merit to what Werner Herzog deems ""the ecstatic truth?""  Do different rules apply for writing memoir versus writing reported essays and articles?  How can we work responsibly with quotes while making dialogue readable?  Just how experimental can we be while earning the mantle of nonfiction?  In this class we will read works that take different approaches at mining toward the truth and unpack various distinct points of view on the debate.  Our classes will consist mainly of discussion, with occasional in-class writing exercises and presentations.  Students will write reflection papers on the asigned texts throughout the course and compose their own code of nonfiction ethics by the term's end, and examine their own work under this rubric.",Elianna Kan,2:10pm,4:00pm,46925,Morningside,UN3216-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170450/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3216-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard

 This poetry workshop is reserved for accomplished poetry writers and maintains the highest level of creative and critical expectations.

WRIT UN3315,POETIC METER AND FORM,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites.  Department approval NOT required. 
 This course will investigate the uses of rhythmic order and disorder in English-language poetry, with a particular emphasis on 'formal' elements in 'free' verse. Through a close analysis of poems, we'll examine the possibilities of qualitative meter, and students will write original creative work within (and in response to) various formal traditions. Analytical texts and poetic manifestos will accompany our reading of exemplary poems. Each week, we'll study interesting examples of metrical writing, and I'll ask you to write in reponse to those examples. Our topics will include 
stress meter, syllable-stress meter, double and triple meter, rising and falling rhythms, promotion, demotion, inversion, elision, and foot scansion. 
Our study will include a greate range of pre-modern and modern writers, from Keats to W.D. Snodgrass, Shakespeare to Denise Levertov, Blake to James Dickey, Whitman to Louise Gluck etc. As writers, we'll always be thinking about how the 
formal choices 
of a poem are appropriate or inappropriate for the poem's 
content. 
We'll also read prose by poets describing their metrical craft.",Joseph N Fasano,12:10pm,2:00pm,46837,Morningside,UN3315-20193-001,,Writing,WRIT,http://culpa.info/professors/6553,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190416170500/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/WRIT/UN3315-20193-001/,To be announced,Classroom,"Barnard
