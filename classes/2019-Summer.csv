AHIS GR8006,PROBLEMS IN CURATING,"Problems in Curating will take up the question of what it means to think about an exhibition intellectually, using a philosophical lens through which to assess and create a narrative in relation to art. The course will consider the rigor of curatorial idea against its possible realization in a gallery setting; consider how an exhibition intervenes in a particular understanding of art; and whether it develops upon previous exhibitions that broach similar issues. The course will also analyze and develop installation strategies as well as the larger discursive framework that goes into an exhibition (from publications to public programs).",Holger A Klein,,,10114,Morningside,GR8006-20192-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/423,silver,13.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125624/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/GR8006-20192-001/,,,,3,,,20192AHIS8006S001,SEMINAR
AHIS S2314,MASTERS OF THE BAROQUE,"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art—Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Velázquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)—artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",Lindsey P Schneider,1:00pm,4:10pm,76060,Morningside,S2314-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),AHIS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125605/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S2314-20192-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3426,JACKSON POLLOCK & THE NY SCHOOL,"Coming on the heels of the MoMA's blockbuster exhibit, this seminar will trace the rise and fall of Abstract Expressionism, from its pre-World War II precipitates in Europe (Surrealism) and in America (Regionalism), to the crucial moment when, as scholar Serge Guilbaut has argued, New York ""stole"" the idea of modern art, and finally, through the decade when Pop Art rendered Abstract Expressionism obsolete. Although special emphasis will be given to Jackson Pollock, whose persona and work reside at the literal and figurative center of the movement, we will also look closely at works by Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem DeKooning, Lee Krasner, Louise Bourgeois, Helen Frankenthaler, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly.  Class lectures and presentations will be supplemented with trips to New York's world-renowned museums.",Kent M Minturn,1:00pm,4:10pm,23808,Morningside,S3426-20192-001,JACKSON POLLOCK & NY SCH,Summer Session (SS),AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/353,silver,2.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125610/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3426-20192-001/,934 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3441,NYC AND THE HISTORY OF MUSEUM,"This course will introduce students to the history of museums and display practices through New York collections. The birth of the museum as a constitutive element of modernity coincides with the establishment of European nation states. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, museums were founded in major European and American cities to classify objects, natural and manmade, from plants and fossils to sculpture and clothing. This course presents the alternate art history that can be charted through an examination of the foundation and development of museums from cabinets of curiosity to the collection-less new museums currently being built in the Middle East and beyond. We will consider broad thematic issues such as nationalism, colonialism, canon formation, the overlapping methods of anthropology and art history, and the notion of 'framing' from the architectural superstructure to exhibition design. We will visit a wide variety of museums from the American Museum of Natural History to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum as in-depth case studies of more general concepts. Students will have the opportunity to meet museum educators, conservators and curators through on site teaching in a variety of institutions.",Risham Majeed,1:00pm,4:10pm,14896,Morningside,S3441-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),AHIS,http://culpa.info/professors/3935,,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125613/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3441-20192-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

AHIS S3442,"""AMER ART IN """"LONG"""" 19TH CENT""","Through an examination of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography and the visual culture of the United States from 1750 to 1914, the course will explore how American artists responded to and operated within the wider world. Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the ""long"" nineteenth century, ranging from Romanticism to Modernism. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using, and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the profound changes that occurred during the Civil War. The class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad. In addition to lectures/discussions in the classroom, field trips to the Metropolitan Museum (the American Wing, Nineteenth Century Wing, Galleries of Modem and Contemporary Art, and the Photography Study Collection), the Museum of Modem Art and the Whitney Museum of Art, represent a vital aspect of the course. One of the important questions raised in the class is the recent reinterpretation of American art's interaction with international movements in museum installations and scholarship, moving away from an isolationist approach to one that engages with global influence and awareness. Readings will draw not only from primarily sources, but also from many of the publications of the Terra Foundation, whose exhibitions and research programs work to encourage an understanding and exploration of American Art from a global context.",Page S Knox,9:00am,12:10pm,74844,Morningside,S3442-20192-001,AMERICAN ART LONG 19TH CENTURY,Summer Session (SS),AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/1214,silver,14.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125616/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3442-20192-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

We will study Impressionist art and artists in relation to the aesthetic, social and political backdrop of late nineteenth-century France, with attention to the artistic climate in America and Great Britain. Central to the discussion will be the position of women artists, models and collectors during this transformative period.

AHIS S3445,WHAT IS PERFORMANCE ART?,"This summer intensive presents New York City as a laboratory for the history and practice of performance art. Positioned between the dramatic and visual arts, performance has become both a major force in contemporary art and an object of the popular imaginationâ€”encompassing everything from the puzzling antics of celebrities and politicians to encounters on public transit. What is performance art, exactly, and why is it important? What were the stakes of its historical emergence? How is it different than other art forms, and why does this matter? In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate these questions historically and theoretically, as well as through creative assignments and experiential exercises inside and outside of the classroom. The course is grounded in the rich history of performance art indigenous to New York City: beginning with its local antecedents in Dada and the Harlem Renaissance after World War I, we will chart how performance art flourished in the experimental downtown milieu of the 1960s and 70s to become a crucial platform for contemporary explorations of identity, body politics, and social relations. Along the way, we will draw on the cityâ€™s museums and the urban environment itself as sites of living history and collaborative learning.",Gillian T Young,9:00am,12:10pm,61446,Morningside,S3445-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),AHIS,http://localhost:8801/professors/13622,,3.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529125622/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/AHIS/S3445-20192-001/,930 Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Furthermore, the course challenges stereotypes of Islam, and of people who one way or another can be called Muslims; most often perceived as a homogenous category through which all Muslim societies are imagined. The course is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the idea of “anthropology of Islam” through different readings in anthropology and various, experiences, practices, dimensions of Islam as a relationship between humans and God. In the second part, the focus is to listen to Islam and connect the different sonic bodies of Islam to power and politics. The third part interrogates preconceived ideas about Islam, gender, feminism, and agency. The fourth part studies Islam, body, sexuality and eroticism. The fifth part is concerned with Islam, youth culture, identity, belonging and rebellion.

First, we will look at how violence has been situated as an object of study within anthropology, as a theoretical concept as well as in practice. We will then look at the issue of terrorism and how anthropology as a discipline contributes to understanding this particular form of violence. Finally, we will consider gender-based violence with close attention to the colonial/post-colonial settings where Islam is a salient factor. Gender based violence is one of the main forces producing and reproducing gender inequality. We will pay particular attention to the concept of the ""Muslim woman"" in both the colonial and colonized imagination.",Ellen Marakowitz,1:00pm,4:10pm,21376,Morningside,S3722-20192-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3387,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115501/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3722-20192-001/,467 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S3921,ANTI-COLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ 
The Black Jacobins
, Mahatma Gandhi’s 
Hind Swaraj
, Aimé Cesairé’s 
Discourse on Colonialism
, Albert Memmi’s 
Colonizer and Colonized
, and Frantz Fanon’s 
The Wretched of the Earth
—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,9:00am,12:10pm,12464,Morningside,S3921-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/2077,silver,6.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115506/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S3921-20192-001/,457 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

ANTH S4187,WOMEN & GENDER IN SOUTH ASIA,"This course is an ethnographic and historical introduction to the construction of gender and feminist theory in the South Asian context. We will focus on textual and visual material, primarily ethnographies and films, to provide a critique of normative representations of the ""South Asian woman"". These readings will be used to reveal the complex social and historical configurations that institute and obscure gendered experiences and representations within the colonial imagination and their colonized others. A significant motif of this course will be to develop alternative ways of knowing and understanding gender construction, sexual relations, and community formation in South Asia.",Sonia Ahsan,5:30pm,8:40pm,72412,Morningside,S4187-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),ANTH,http://culpa.info/professors/3513,gold,4.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529115510/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ANTH/S4187-20192-001/,963 EXT Schermerhorn Hall [SCH],,"Barnard

Assignments use the TensorFlow and PyTorch programming frameworks, and a final deep learning project is based on a process, data challenge, or research topic.  
 
Section 003:  Foundations of cryptography and blockchain
 
 Prerequisites: Elementary knowledge of programming and data structures (COMS W3134, COMS W3136, or COMS W3137), discrete mathematics and discrete probability (W3203). Preferred knowledge of elements of the theory of computing (COMS W3261 or COMS W4231).  If the prerequisites are not satisfied please consult with the instructor. 
 The course is divided into two halves. The first half is an elementary but rigorous study of ideas in private-key and public-key cryptography. The second half studies relevant topics in distributed consensus, principles of distributed ledgers, and selected state-of-the-art topics in blockchains. The course concludes with the presentation of applications of blockchain in the design of digital currencies and smart contracts.

Studying this  leads to questions on a variety of key issues, such as  immigration, affirmative action, health insurance,  income inequality, and much more. This course will  combine both theory and empirics to understand the  labor market; however, greater emphasis will be put  on real-world applications over solving abstract  mathematical problems. We will use theory to  provide a framework of how to analyze the complex  interaction between individuals, firms, and the  government in the labor market. We will then learn  about empirical research that tests the predictions of  the theory as well as the effectiveness of policies.  Emphasis will be given to new research, giving  students exposure to the frontier of labor economics.",Motaz R Al-Chanati,12:30pm,2:05pm,29852,Morningside,S4400-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),ECON,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529153517/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ECON/S4400-20192-001/,516 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

Hamlet
, Shakespeareâ€™s remarkable development of the techniques of characterization that have made generations of both playgoers and readers feel that his dramatis personae are so modern, real, human.  We will also devote attention to exploring the value of each play in our present moment and on our local stages.  We read 8 plays in all, including

ENGL S3267,THE AMERICAN SUBLIME: EMERSON TO DYLAN,"There is something savage in the American soul. D. H. Lawrence called it the “American demon”; Hart Crane called it the “American psychosis.” It is in the Puritan experience of isolation in the New England wilderness; and in the uncharted vastness of the West and the violence of its colonization. It is in a utopian New World that promised the overthrow of tradition and the limitless freedom of the Open Road. It is in the everyday barbarism of slavery and the carnage of the Civil War. It is in the insatiable global hunger of American imperialism. It is in the terrifying spectacle of a reality-TV president utterly indifferent to reality. In the USA, all that is solid melts into air. And yet: the chaos of our history has yielded visionary works of art; our lust for transcendence has borne strange fruits and terrible beauties. In this course we will celebrate the incandescence of the American sublime, while probing its perils, in works including: Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essays; Herman Melville’s 
Moby-Dick
; poetry of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane; music of Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Hank Williams, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, Thelonious Monk, and Bob Dylan; and David Lynch’s film “Lost Highway.”",Benjamin W Barasch,1:00pm,4:10pm,60819,Morningside,S3267-20192-001,Emerson to Dylan,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160408/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3267-20192-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3273,THE POET OF THE BODY: NEW YORK'S WALT WH,"Walt Whitman was not the first to write about New York.  But he was the first of many to let New York write him.  By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of 
Leaves of Grass
, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America’s greatest poet?  This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that “Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son” was indeed a product of his environment.  Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself.  Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman’s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered 
Life and Adventures of Jack Engle
) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman’s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.  Experiential learning is further encouraged through assignments based in archives, museums, and at historic sites throughout the city.",Karen Karbiener,1:00pm,4:10pm,11213,Morningside,S3273-20192-001,THE POET OF THE BODY,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/77,silver,7.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160410/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3273-20192-001/,313 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3483,RELATIONALITY IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN P,"In a culture that celebrates individualism and self-determination, American literature has often been a site for developing alternative conceptions of identity, beyond the ideology of human autonomy. This course focuses on the concept of relationality in contemporary literary texts, which posits that all human existence is inextricably interconnected with and shaped by the external world – both human and non-human. We will examine American fiction and nonfiction writing that embraces vulnerability, dependency, attachment, and solidarity and fosters a reorientation towards relational concepts of identity through both content and form. Relational psychoanalysis as well as philosophies of intersubjectivity and dialogism will serve as points of departure for analyzing the selected texts, especially as they create new possibilities for thinking about self-other relations. These theoretical models – from Hegel’s philosophy of self-consciousness to Glissant’s poetics of relationality – will offer a rich foundation for close readings of American prose narratives by Siri Hustvedt, Alison Bechdel, Maggie Nelson, Audre Lorde, Edwidge Danticat, and Richard Powers. Focusing on intersections of ethics and aesthetics across different genres, we will analyze how formal literary choices shape the encounter between author and reader.",,1:00pm,4:10pm,27820,Morningside,S3483-20192-001,RELATIONALITY IN CONTEMPORARY,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160412/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3483-20192-001/,309 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3714,"HAWTHORNE,JAMES,AND CATHER","“What is he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other. “A writer of story-books! What kind of a business in life,—what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation,—may that be? Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler! - Nathaniel Hawthorne, “The Custom House” (1850) , Fiction is one of the fine arts, deserving in its turn of all the honors and emoluments that have hitherto been reserved for the successful profession of music, poetry, painting, architecture. It is impossible to insist too much on so important a truth. - Henry James, “The Art of Fiction” (1884) , In any discussion of the novel, one must make it clear whether one is talking about the novel as a form of amusement, or as a form of art. […] Amusement is one thing; enjoyment of art is another. - Willa Cather, “The Novel Démeublé” (1922) , Can fiction be an art? While we may be inclined to say “yes” today, in the nineteenth century the reputation of fiction writing – novels, tales, short stories, and sketches – was by no means so secure. Novelists were more likely to be considered entertainers or “story- tellers” than serious artists, and novels were usually thought of as frivolous at best and immoral at worst, and certainly not worthy of serious scrutiny or consideration. How did the reputation of fiction writing in America develop such that novels could be considered certifiably “artistic?”This course examines the novels, short fiction, and critical writings of three important American writers: Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, and Willa Cather. While very different in very many ways, these three authors shared a belief that fiction was a serious business, and every bit as much an art as painting, poetry, sculpture, music, or other “fine” arts. They also all shared an interest in representing these various fine arts and the artists that make them in their novels and stories, often using the figure of the painter, the sculptor, the actor, or the singer in order to explore, develop, and justify their own fictional practice. In other words, this class will examine “the art of fiction” in at least two ways: both by looking at the representation of art and artists in the fiction of these three writers, and also by examining how such representations help these writers to make fiction an art in its own right. This course asks: This course asks: What ideas about the “fine arts” led to the exclusion of novels?

ENGL S3802,GEORGE ELIOT,"Author of 
Middlemarch
, widely regarded as “the best English novel,” George Eliot was hailed by her successor Henry James as “one of the noblest, most beautiful minds of our time.”  This course will engage Eliot not only as a consummate author of nineteenth-century realist fiction but also as an ethical philosopher.  Her novels explore the questions, “How should one live?” “What is the right thing to do?” “What is one’s obligation to the other?” while rejecting moral didacticism.  We will read four of Eliot’s masterpieces along with brief excerpts from her essays and from philosophers Spinoza, Feuerbach, J.S. Mill, Spencer, and G.H. Lewes, all of whom critically influenced Eliot’s thinking. For Eliot, the novel serves as a vehicle for ethical inquiry; without “lapsing from the picture to the diagram,” her rich narrative portrayal of character and social intercourse gives “flesh and blood” to philosophical dilemmas, bringing home to readers the real consequences of moral choice and action. The major issues of Victorian debate, including utilitarianism, sympathy, early sociology, faith, and feminism, will inform our study.",Aileen G Forbes,9:00am,12:10pm,26604,Morningside,S3802-20192-001,GEORGE ELIOT: ETHICS & FICTION,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,http://localhost:8801/professors/9680,,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160419/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3802-20192-001/,507 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

but will then focus on contemporary literature, with some reference back to influential authors like Judy Bloom, Louis Lowry, and Martin Ritt.  We will study the features of YA literature and ask what distinguishes it from other literary categories; how YA explores questions of teen identity, sociality, and development; how it uses or challenges genre conventions; and how it engages with current events and social problems.  Students should expect heavy reading over this short summer term, but readings are guaranteed to be interesting, relevant, and fast paced.",Rachel Adams,1:00pm,4:10pm,61090,Morningside,S3829-20192-001,YA FICTION,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/904,,16.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160421/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3829-20192-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S3851,"PARADISE LOST,FRANKENSTEIN,AND","Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. 
 (Seminar). As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. , Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Mulk Raj Anand, Raja Rao, Mahasweta Devi, Bapsi Sidwa, Rohinton Mistry, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy. ,

ENGL S3915,THE ART OF THE ESSAY,"“Learned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.”
― 
Michel de Montaigne
 
 
 “There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.” Annie Dillard
, 
The Writing Life
  
 
“Find a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.” Kurt Vonnegut
 
 What makes the essay of personal experience an 
essay
 rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16
th
-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, “What do I know?,” and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",Wendy C Schor-Haim,9:00am,12:10pm,62250,Morningside,S3915-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/4531,silver,10.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160429/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S3915-20192-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

ENGL S4401,18TH CENTURY & ROMANTIC POETRY,"This course is a study of romantic poetry and poetics but does not approach its subject from the belated perspective of the Victorians or the Moderns. Instead, the famous Romantics of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are viewed proleptically, from the vantage point of early and mid 18th-century poets who established the modern criteria and generated the forms and ideas later ingeniously personalized by the poets we customarily refer to as the Romantics. Indeed, though we shall spend the concluding half of our study with Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats, our study begins with the neoclassical romanticism of Pope, Thomson, Akenside, the Wartons, Gray, and Goldsmith. As such, our reading entails a study of lyric trends bridging 18th - and 19th-century verse and of related discourses in aesthetic psychology, moral philosophy, experimental religion, natural description, and affective criticism. We shall attend closely to rhetorical and prosodic elements, with a view to characteristic genres (ode, epistle, georgic, epitaph), innovative hybrids and new forms (elegy, the ""conversational"" poem). Recommended and required readings in prose are of the period and include theoretical and critical writings by our poets.",Marianne Giordani,9:00am,12:10pm,17692,Morningside,S4401-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),ENGL,http://culpa.info/professors/3085,silver,8.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529160431/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/ENGL/S4401-20192-001/,301 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

An examination of the different forms of staged comedy throughout the centuries, beginning with foundational texts from Ancient Greece, especially Aristophanes. We consider how today's playwrights are still building on, and making reference to, primary works from the Western canon. Texts we will read range from Shakespeare, Jonson and Restoration comedies, to Wilde, Beckett, Hansberry, Tennessee Williams, Pinter, and Churchill. We will also cover contemporary work seen on the stages of New York, including short comic plays, stand up, and physical comedy. Attention will be given to comic characters, comic pretense, wit, humor, comedy of errors, comic gestures, comic archetypes, farce, cross-dressing, satiric comedy, comic relief, tragicomedy, romantic comedy, and theatre of the absurd.

While using a short film script as their own case study – students will learn pitching, development, script breakdown, scheduling, budgeting and fundraising. Discussion of legal issues, location scouting, deliverables, marketing, distribution and film festival strategy will allow students to move forward with their own projects after completing the class. Using weekly assignments, in-class presentations and textbook readings to reinforce each class discussion topic, students will complete the class having created a final prep/production binder for their project, which includes the script breakdown, production schedule, line item budget, financing/fundraising plan and film festival strategy for their chosen script.",,10:00am,1:00pm,14955,Morningside,S3833-20192-001,LAB PRODUCING LOW BUDGET FILM,Summer Session (SS),FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529162940/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/S3833-20192-001/,605 Dodge Hall,Classroom,"Barnard

FILM S4215,CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL DOCUMENTAR,"Documentaries are increasingly proliferating across small and large screens around the world. They circulate as market commodities, forms of entertainment, and vehicles for social change. In this seminar we will compare different national and region contexts of contemporary documentary production, including projects created within the media industries of Mexico, Peru, India, China, Cambodia, and Israel. We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda.  This course partially satisfies the Global Core requirement.",Joshua L Glick,1:00pm,5:00pm,17728,Morningside,S4215-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),FILM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529162943/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/FILM/S4215-20192-001/,507 Dodge Hall,,"Barnard

FREN S3880,FR EXPRESSV DANCE-NYC & PARIS,"Cross-Atlantic influences from both French ballet and French modern dance as seen on the stages of New York City. The course examines not only French dancers and choreographers, but also French conceptions of the expressive body seen in other urban art forms. We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City.

GRKM S3935,HELLENISM AND THE TOPOGRAPHICA,"Course Overview:
 This course examines the way particular spaces—cultural, urban, literary—serve as sites for the production and reproduction of cultural and political imaginaries. It places particular emphasis on the themes of the 
polis
, the city, and the nation-state as well as on spatial representations of and responses to notions of the Hellenic across time. Students will consider a wide range of texts as spaces—complex sites constituted and complicated by a multiplicity of languages—and ask: To what extent is meaning and cultural identity, site-specific? How central is the classical past in Western imagination? How have great metropolises such as Paris, Istanbul, and New York fashioned themselves in response to the allure of the classical and the advent of modern Greece? How has Greece as a specific site shaped the study of the Cold War, dictatorships, and crisis?",Dimitrios Antoniou,9:00am,12:10pm,11248,Morningside,S3935-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),GRKM,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529164910/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/GRKM/S3935-20192-001/,613 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

Two central concerns: first, the Mughal regnal politics towards their rival imperial concerns within India and West Asia (the Maratha, the Rajput, the Safavid, the Ottoman); and second, the foreign gaze onto the Mughals (via the presence of Portuguese, English, and French travelers, merchants, and diplomats in India).

HIST S3116,HISTORY OF CAPITALISM,"Capitalism shapes every aspect of our daily lives. Thinkers on both the left and the right of the political spectrum agree that capitalism structures our economic, social, and political relationships. Yet, there is little agreement as to the definition of capitalism and its normative implications. The definition and interpretation of capitalism differs across time and space, always evolving in response to challenges, crises, and contradictions.  
 The aim of this course is to provide students with analytical tools to think critically and historically about the concept of capitalism. By studying how philosophers, economists, and political theorists have defined and described the concept of capitalism throughout its history (from the early seventeenth century to the present), students will be provided with a set of terminologies and analytical frameworks that enable them to interrogate the various dimensions of capitalism. The readings in the course are selected to illustrate the fact that capitalism has always been controversial. We will read texts authored by both proponents and critics of capitalism. We will explore how various canonical figures have thought about private property, markets, money, economic growth, injustice, inequality, alienation, and socialism.",Carl Wennerlind,1:00pm,4:10pm,25840,Morningside,S3116-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/613,,30.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529165717/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3116-20192-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

HIST S3455,GLOBAL HIST OF THE US MILITARY,"America's wars in context, from King Philip's War in 1675 to present conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East. This course charts the expansion of U.S. military power from a band of colonists to a globe-girdling colossus with over two million personnel, some 800 bases around the world, and an annual budget of approximately $686 billion - about 57 percent of federal discretionary spending, and more than the next 14 nations combined. It introduces students to the history of American military power; the economic, political, and technological rise of the military-industrial complex and national security state; the role of the armed services in international humanitarian work; and the changing role of the military in domestic and international politics.

Through histories of coercion, migration, labor recruitment, family networks, religious conversion, wars of occupation, economic need, political exile, education inequities, electoral participation, and unimaginative representations in film, fiction, and broader popular culture, millions of people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, and the rest of Latin America have somehow become American, while still remaining outside the national community. This 3-point undergraduate lecture course will examine the process of departure and arrival-the historical forces pushing and pulling people from Latin America to the United States. We will also examine how ""Spanish,"" ""Latins,"" ""Hispanics,"" and ""Latinos"" adjust, integrate, assimilate, resist, and adapt to the many forces that affect their lives in the U.S. over the last century and a half, creating new ethnic, racial and local identities in the process. By studying the experience of Latinos/as and Latin American immigrants with an eye toward patterns of second-class citizenship, identity formation, ethnic culture, community maturation, labor struggles, and social mobility, we will map out the heterogeneous mosaic of Latin American and Caribbean diasporas in the U.S. Due in large part to ongoing immigration from Mexico, the Mexican-origin population has grown appreciably from approximately 100,000 at the turn of the twentieth century to thirty-five million today (10% of the overall U.S. population and about 65% of the collective Latino community). We shall therefore pay special attention to what ethnic Mexicans, their offspring, and other Americans have had to say about the Mexican American experience and its effects on Latino/a social life as well as the nation's economy, society, and culture. Naturally, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Central/South American communities in the United States will be examined as well. The study of Latino history is a young discipline, with many gaps and grey areas. It also exists in a complex and tense dialogue (often a monologue) within broader U.S. history. During the last two decades as the Latino population has ballooned to 56 million (1",Darius V Echeverria,9:00am,12:10pm,19361,Morningside,S3596-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),HIST,http://culpa.info/professors/13840,,1.0,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529165724/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/S3596-20192-001/,311 Fayerweather,,"Barnard

Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images. Subjects to be addressed include: the nature of evidence; documentation and witness; censorship; iconoclasm; surveillance; profiling; advocacy images; signs on the body; visibility and invisibility.",Susan M Merriam,1:00pm,4:10pm,23828,Morningside,S4190-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),HRTS,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529170344/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HRTS/S4190-20192-001/,402 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

And yet, according to the UN Secretary-Generalâ€™s (SG) annual report on children and armed conflict last year armed conflicts around the world led to at least 4,000 verified rights violations against children committed by government forces and over 11,500 by non-state militant groups. The violations include killing or maiming, recruitment or use of children in hostilities, sexual violence, using children as human bombs, abductions, the denial of humanitarian access, and attacks on schools and hospitals. About 50 percent of the estimated 26 million people currently displaced by armed conflicts and violence are children.

. Part of the Core Curriculum since 1947, Music Humanities aims to instill in students a basic comprehension of the many forms of the Western musical imagination.

SECTIONS 001 and 002 are for General Studies students only.  SECTIONS 003 and 004 are for Columbia College students only. This course will require two in-class meetings before and after Summer Session X. The first meeting will be held Friday, May 3, from 4:00 to 6:00pm (location TBA) and the second meeting will be held Friday, Sept. 6, from 4:00 to 6:00pm (location TBA). All other meetings and class interactions will be conducted online throughout the Summer Session X. 
 This new course, “Seminar for the Core as Praxis/Fieldwork,” will provide an opportunity to explore the ways in which the methods of interpretation and habits of mind established in courses in the Core Curriculum will inform your experiences beyond the classroom. Students will be guided through a process of reflection on their ideas about a Core text and on their experience in an internship, to see how theory can be observed or put into action in practice. Students will choose a text that they have studied previously in Literature Humanities or in Contemporary Civilization as the basis for their work over the summer. 
Therefore, (1) students must be engaged in an internship during the summer, and (2) students must register for the section of HUMA S2000 that represents the class from which they will choose their text to revisit (i.e., enroll in a section titled Literature Humanities (Fieldwork) or Contemporary Civilization (Fieldwork)).

INAF S6554,UN & THE CHAL OF PEACE,"It is now a well known fact that countries embroiled in conflict seldom emerge from it ""once and for all."" They tend to relapse back into conflict within months or years. The reasons are also well-known: low education and high poverty levels, weak or non- existent institutions, poor governance, exclusion and marginalization of certain groups including women and poor economic prospects certainly in livelihoods. And yet Peace building in the international context is a relatively new concept. It appeared in the in the UN lexicon in the 1980s and has evolved as a normative concept since. Peace building is complex and multi-faceted encompassing security, human rights, development and reconciliation of past differences and ultimately societal transformation. It is before everything else a political exercise. This course will ask: How is Peace building done, who are the actors and stakeholders? What lessons have we learnt since the 1980s? What does it take to build the peace? The course will give an understanding of the evolution of the norm of peace building at the United Nations and discuss the new UN Peace building architecture. Ten years after its creation, has the Peace Building Commission made a difference and why? What have been its challenges? It will look at the many stakeholders on the ground and discuss the issue of coordination and the need for integrated strategies. It will provide examples of countries that have succeeded, analyze the root causes of the conflicts and the tools which were used. It will extract the lessons learned and the conditions for peace building to succeed.",James William Rawley,2:00pm,5:10pm,67965,Morningside,S6554-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529172711/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6554-20192-001/,405A International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

INAF S6559,UN & MAINT OF INTL PEACE & SEC,"This past year marked the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations (UN) and the year when a new Secretary-General will be selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki Moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to -­â€ fewer but deadlier -­armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate -­armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",Arthur Boutellis,5:30pm,8:40pm,74445,Morningside,S6559-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),INAF,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529172712/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/INAF/S6559-20192-001/,501A International Affairs Building,,"Barnard

In this class, you'll learn the essentials to great journalism--research, ethics, interview technique--as well as how to tell those stories in a way that engages and informs an audience. You'll learn how to write for the ear, how to capture rich sound, how to edit using Adobe Audition, and how to think like a radio producer.

 explores the origins and roles of modern war reporting, examines the challenges journalists face, and discusses journalism's place in the public discourse of armed conflict and political violence, most notably terrorism. Taught by U.S. Marine corps veteran and Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and author, C.J. Chivers, class discussions will be lively and require student engagement. There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war.

LAW_ S3150,COMPARATIVE JURISPRUDENCE,"Jurisprudence, at its core, is the study of legal theory. Fundamentally, however, what is ""law?"" By studying alternative constitutional systems, what can we learn about the legal foundations of various governments and societies? What influence has legal theory had on the development of very different government structures, and how do different governments grapple with constitutional controversy? This course is designed to explore the basic foundational principles that make up the study of legal theory. It begins by studying the core schools of thought, including natural law, legal positivism, and legal realism. The course then uses these basic concepts to explore and understand the greater development of fundamental, constitutional law and theory within different legal systems in different countries. By comparing various constitution and government structures, using basic legal philosophy as a guide, students will gain a valuable base understanding of the development and execution of legal thought within different societies.",Christopher R Riano,6:15pm,9:20pm,69634,Morningside,S3150-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),LAW_,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529175224/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LAW_/S3150-20192-001/,411 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

LAW_ S3200,CONS LAW THRU LENS OF HIGHR ED,"The intricacies of the most controversial aspects of the American Constitution play out daily on college campuses across the country. Who gets admitted to elite institutions, and what factors should they consider? Faculties have tenure to protect their right to challenge conventional wisdom, but what exactly does Academic Freedom protect? Students have the right to free speech, or do they? Can a college censor a student newspaper? If a student is disciplined on campus, do they have a right to an attorney? Do students have a property interest in their education that can cost over $100,000? How does the law treat private and public institutions differently? This course is designed to explore the most controversial of constitutional topics including the First Amendment right to free speech, the Fifth Amendment's takings clause, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection, procedural due process and substantive due process in regards to life, liberty, and property.",Christopher R Riano,6:15pm,9:20pm,26292,Morningside,S3200-20192-001,,Summer Session (SS),LAW_,,,,,https://web.archive.org///web/20190529175226/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/LAW_/S3200-20192-001/,509 Hamilton Hall,,"Barnard

POLS S3296,REFORMING AMERICAN ELECTIONS,"Nothing is more important to the legitimacy of a representative government than the integrity of elections. Throughout the history of the American republic, various actors have sought to shape electoral outcomes. Some have even done so legally! While contemporary citizens of the United States have tended to think of their elections as paragons of reliability, events in the last fifteen years or so have increasingly led to questions on this front. This course will examine issues of fairness, integrity, and security currently facing the American electoral system. In identifying ailments in American democracy, we will discuss both their causes and effects. Finally, we will examine potential reforms in an effort to determine to what extent American elections can be “fixed” (see what I did there?).
