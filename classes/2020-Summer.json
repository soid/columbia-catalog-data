New technologies would enable a host of \u201cnew media\u201d that often supplanted and always transformed traditional ones. By the 1960s the dominant narratives that had given abstract painting a logic had lost favor, and new challenges were posed to artists who wanted to work in a medium that was increasingly seen as artistically regressive. As well, institutions that had often tamed radical art in the name of aesthetic sublimation were coming under increasing fire for suppressing\u2014by the choice to show only paintings of a certain, largely \u201cformalist\u201d kind\u2014alternative voices. This course will examine the ways painters negotiated these challenges and gave rise to the proliferation of types of painting that flourished later.",

    "course_descr":"This course examines three masters of European Baroque art\u2014Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680), Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660), and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669)\u2014artists who are all well represented in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through classroom discussions and museum visits, we will examine Baroque art as part of a continuing and developing accumulation of forms and ideas throughout the 17th century, and consider the impact these artists had on their contemporaries and in ensuing centuries. Roughly half of the class sessions take place at the Metropolitan Museum, a luxury that allows for close, firsthand analysis of art, but it is not an art appreciation course. It is a history course concerned with a study of ideas, artists, and visual facts and their application to emerging art forms within their cultural-historical context. In addition to developing a critical eye, the class is intended to develop analytical thinking and communication skills as well as knowledge of the subject matter.",

    "course_descr":"Through an examination of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography and the visual culture of the United States from 1750 to 1914, the course will explore how American artists responded to and operated within the wider world. Addressing themes shared in common across national boundaries, the class will consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the 'long' nineteenth century, ranging from Romanticism to Modernism. The period witnessed the emergence of new technologies for creating, using, and circulating images and objects, the expansion and transformation of exhibition and viewing practices, and the rise of new artistic institutions, as well as the metamorphosis of the United States from its colonial origins to that of a world power, including the profound changes that occurred during the Civil War. The class will investigate how American art engaged with international movements while constructing national identity during a period of radical transformation both at home and abroad. In addition to lectures\/discussions in the classroom, field trips to the Metropolitan Museum (the American Wing, Nineteenth Century Wing, Galleries of Modem and Contemporary Art, and the Photography Study Collection), the Museum of Modem Art and the Whitney Museum of Art, represent a vital aspect of the course. One of the important questions raised in the class is the recent reinterpretation of American art's interaction with international movements in museum installations and scholarship, moving away from an isolationist approach to one that engages with global influence and awareness. Readings will draw not only from primarily sources, but also from many of the publications of the Terra Foundation, whose exhibitions and research programs work to encourage an understanding and exploration of American Art from a global context.",

    "course_descr":"This course considers the relationship between wealth and democracy, in theory, in history, and in practice today. Topics investigated include the following: political and legal debates about campaign finance reform from the late 20th century to the present, including whether money is speech and whether campaigns should be publicly financed; the role of the wealthy in American politics as candidates and as donors\/funders; and the nature and problem of political corruption.\n \n Readings are drawn from philosophers and political theorists, contemporary studies of the impact of wealth on American democracy, and key Supreme Court decisions including Citizens United. Other sources include film excerpts and press accounts. Students also benefit from several guest speakers working on issues pertaining to campaign finance and related issues of money and politics on the local, state, and\/or national level.\n \n Morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. Afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups.\n \n In addition to completing and discussing reading assignments, students write position papers and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.\n \n Our ultimate goal is not to establish the proper role of money in politics, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about wealth and democracy that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future.",

Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts\u2014C.L.R. James\u2019 The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Aim\u00e9 Cesair\u00e9\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi\u2019s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth\u2014this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",

We examine different types of buildings such as museums, churches, libraries, and transportation hubs. While the primary focus is on learning through observation and analysis, students also learn to think and imagine through hands-on, at-home model-making, using materials they should be able to find around their homes.",

The course covers how to analyze a building visually and formally, and introduces a spectrum of significant historical and recent designs while instilling an understanding of how the built environment is generated and transformed. Through discussions of challenging readings that encompass the political, social, technological, and economic aspects of the field, students are introduced to selected architectural themes. Class discussions are supplemented with digital architectural tours of the Columbia University campus and virtual visits to prominent works of modern architecture in New York City such as the Whitney Museum, the High Line Park, Grand Central Station, and the Seagram Building.\n \n The afternoon studio class, conducted online as a creative workshop, introduces participants to the conceptual skills employed by architectural designers. Instructors provide students with basic training in 2D and 3D visualization software and introduce them to the process of conceptualizing and developing architectural ideas. A short project is undertaken in the final week, in which students develop their own designs for an intervention on one of the New York City sites that was visited earlier in the session.",

    "course_descr":"From the Sans-Culottes to Pantsuit Nation, fashion has moved from being an expression of class status to a declaration of self. Fashion has also been weaponized and used as a call-to-arms for political, social, gender, and economic reform. This course examines the role of fashion (Victorian to Modern) as a barometer of cultural consciousness, especially in times of oppression and social unrest. Students will create digital mood boards and learn how fashion designers use them, analyze descriptions of fashion in literature, and read about the evolution of fashion from seminal critics including Roland Barthes, Margaret Atwood, and Valerie Steele. We will view virtual museum exhibitions devoted to fashion, create a framework to analyze the role of fashion in modern life, examine fashion magazines, blogs, and Instagram posts through a critical lens, and learn about the\u00a0design studios of New York fashion designers. Fashion has been dismissed as frivolous by critics, however women including Virginia Woolf and Anna Wintour have refuted that statement. By the end of the course, students will come to their own conclusions, exploring the reasons people might dismiss the role of fashion in culture.",

The course includes in-class interactive exercises to illustrate how simple mathematical models can shed light on seemingly\n complex systems. We will discuss how the ideas on which the standard model rests won over alternative ideas,\n and how scientists are still working to solve some outstanding puzzles, such as the unknown nature of dark\n matter and dark energy.  \n Prerequisites:  One year of high-school physics and calculus are strongly recommended. Experience with Python programming is useful\n for some of the in-class exercises, but not necessary.",

Next we take up the nature of light, the structure of matter, the emission and absorption of light by matter, and nuclear physics. We apply this knowledge to describe the properties of our sun and of the planets of our solar system, the properties and fate of stars in general, and the discovery of planets around other stars. Further topics include galaxies and the dark matter and black holes they contain, supernovae and the creation of chemical elements, and the expansion of the universe. We end with Einsteinian cosmology, the cosmic microwave background, dark energy, and the fate of the universe.",

The course uses real case studies from current research to take an in-depth look at the challenges in conserving life on earth, and the unique ways scientists and ordinary citizens can make a difference.\n \n Class discussions are supplemented with digital simulations of conservation biology and biodiversity concepts. Students learn how to contribute citizen science data to help us understand biodiversity changes in real time, and make observations of their own ecosystem. The course culminates with a stakeholder analysis and proposal for the creation of a new marine reserve.\n \n Please note: Though this course is intended primarily for older students, it is also open to highly qualified rising freshmen and sophomores.",

This rich set of solutions to common problems in host\/parasite interactions provides significant insight and powerful research tools. Virology has enabled a more detailed understanding of the structure and function of molecules, cells and organisms and has provided fundamental understanding of disease and virus evolution.  The course will emphasize the common reactions that must be completed by all viruses for successful reproduction within a host cell and survival and spread within a host population.

We then open the hood and look inside blockchain to see what it is, how it has evolved, and where it is headed, including Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. We examine how these technologies will impact the future of work. Students are encouraged to think about the impact of these technologies on society and how they might become leaders and shapers in these fields.\n \n Participants acquire an understanding and appreciation of these technologies so they can explore further on their own. The course is taught through a mix of instruction, discussion, and guest speakers.\n \n Please note: This course is not a computer programming course and requires no prior knowledge or experience, but rather looks at these emerging technologies more broadly from business, social, political, and cultural perspectives.",

The firm needs cash to undertake worthy investments, and the firm needs to identify investments worth undertaking. What models does the firm use to identify such investments? What sources of cash can the firm use? How do the financial markets in which this money is raised function? How does the market value the firm, its securities, and its investments? What financial instruments are available to the firm? What are the microeconomic models that best describe a firm\u2019s behavior in such markets?\n \n In answering these questions, the participants discuss stocks, bonds, stock markets, as well as valuation models of investments, firms, and securities. They also work with concepts like optimal investment strategies, what is revealed and what is hidden in published accounting statements, and what are some of the sources of risk. Students also acquire familiarity with the mechanics and history of the financial markets.\n \n The course includes case studies and some sustained independent work by the participants.\n \n This course meets for half the day as a large lecture and for the other half as recitation sections of approximately twenty students each.",

Along these lines, we will investigate some elemental properties through laboratory experiments on oxidation-reduction reactions and acid-base chemistry. We will also use hand-held models and computer software to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and to calculate the distribution of electrons within molecules. Finally, we will consider connections of chemistry to philosophical, artistic, and literary questions, such as levels of \u201ctruth\u201d in scientific theories.

    "course_descr":"(Lecture). In the period since 1965, fiction has become global in a new sense and with a new intensity. Comparison is built into it. Writers from different national traditions have been avidly reading each other, wherever they happen to come from, and they often resist \"national\" and regional labels altogether. If you ask the Somali writer Nuruddin Farah whether the precocious child of Maps was inspired by Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, he will answer (at least he did when I asked him) that he and Rushdie both were inspired by Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Grass's The Tin Drum. At the same time, the human experiences around which novelists organize their fiction are often themselves global, explicitly and powerfully but also mysteriously. Our critical language is in some ways just trying to catch up with innovative modes of storytelling that attempt to be responsible to the global scale of interconnectedness on which, as we only rarely manage to realize, we all live. This course will begin with the Sudanese classic Season of Migration to the North, a rewriting of Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness,\" and will end with the British novelist Zadie Smith. In between we will discuss novels by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Marguerite Duras, Milan Kundera, W.G. Sebald, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, and others. Requirements: two short papers (6-8 pages) and a final for undergraduates; one longer paper (12-15 pages) and no final for graduate students.",

Our guiding concern will be the human impulses to explore, invent, and reveal ourselves through writing. We are autobiographical creatures! The will to question, interpret, and represent our experience is central to what it means to think and to live. To this end, our survey of autobiographical writing will consider a number of topics that are fundamental to the humanities in its project of self-study and self-cultivation: the mysteries of interiority, personhood, and identity, and how the forces of gender, race, and class may bear on these conceptions; notions of privacy and publicity; the entanglements of individual and social life, and the relationship between personal and historical experience; exemplarity and its discontents; forms of truth and fiction; narrative, and the elements of storytelling; personal and literary autonomy. Questions we\u2019ll ask along the way include: Just how well can we know ourselves? and how well might we really want to? What kind of knowledge is self-knowledge, and how does compare with other modes of wisdom? What liberties do autobiography and autofiction permit their authors? What specific constraints and moral responsibilities do they enjoin? Many of the texts we\u2019ll study were and are highly controversial, so we\u2019ll also think about the conditions of literary scandal, and the extent to which writing about one\u2019s life, and the lives of others, always entails certain risks.",

Intriguingly, a process much like autofictional writing\u00a0also is at the heart of modern psychoanalytic technique \u2014 and research in neuroscience increasingly\u00a0suggests that the human brain\u2019s potential to morph and adapt might be instrumental to human\u00a0mentation as we know it.

We examine the political, economic and social forces that have underpinned migration in the nations of the Mediterranean rim since the 1950s and observe major transitions in policy and legal frameworks. Though migration is often treated in mainstream media as an object of policy and legislation, it is better approached as a \u2018total social fact\u2019 involving political, social, economic and cultural dimensions. With this in mind, we look at different media, genres and narrative forms in which migration has been represented and debated and grapple with questions about the relationship between politics and art and between life experience and representation.\u00a0  \u00a0  The sources examined in the course include novels and feature and documentary films as well as political and legal discourses and analyses grounded in anthropological, sociological, and philosophical methodologies. Combining empirical with theoretical approaches, we consider both the specific political, legal, social and economic contexts of contemporary migration and broader conceptual questions about the status of \u2018immigrants,\u2019 \u2018migrants\u2019 and \u2018refugees\u2019 as social and cultural figures and political actors. Taking the view that local dynamics have to be situated in broader regional\/global frameworks and vice versa, we examine national framings of migration in countries including France, Morocco and Algeria as well as transnational and cross-regional dynamics.",

What is the current understanding of the anthropogenic impacts on global climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity? How are different economic sectors, geographic regions, and countries contributing to this? How are these impacts predicted to affect future global economic growth prospects, agricultural productivity, poverty, and society at large? Who bears the potential costs and benefits? What can be done?\n \n Using climate change as a unifying focus, this course examines the role of public policy in managing human impacts on the environment. Students are introduced to the theories and concepts of environmental economics, and using these they explore, discuss, and analyze current national and global environmental challenges. They learn the public policy approaches being used to address these challenges, and how these policies influence and interact with the role of the private sector and international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement.\n \n Through coursework and case studies from both the developing and developed world, students gain an understanding of the complex nature of global environmental change and the importance of human-based activities in driving it. Case studies lead to the introduction of sector-based issues (e.g. promoting renewable energy and organic agriculture), innovative policy approaches (e.g. environmental trading schemes, mitigation banking, carbon taxes), and key terms used by the global conservation community to frame and promote discussion of these issues (e.g. ecosystem services, natural capital, water-energy-food nexus).\n \n Coursework includes lectures, required reading, multimedia presentations, online research, and guest speakers. Students are expected and encouraged to participate in class discussions, raise questions, and contribute to small group exercises and presentations.",

They are exposed to current constitutional challenges and are given the opportunity to explore the relationship between law and society.\n \n Students develop skills that enable them to read and interpret Supreme Court decisions, which serve as the basis for class discussion.

Through selected readings including marketing texts, case studies, and current news articles, students acquire a general background in marketing, advertising, and public relations.\n \n Participants gather in the morning sessions for lecture and discussion while devoting the afternoon sessions to hands-on and group work. Students are required to create a new product and marketing plan to present to the class as their final projects.",

    "course_descr":"Did you ever wonder if the universe has a shape, and what it might be? In this course, participants learn how to think about the shape and internal structure of the cosmos from a mathematical\u00a0perspective, culminating in an appreciation for various theoretical models of the universe. Philosophical discussions are informed by pencil and paper computations, experiments with common household materials, and interactive online games and modules.  We begin by learning from the mistakes of archaic geocentric models so as to build intuition about manifolds\u2014structures that look one way up close\u00a0but may look totally different from far away. This sets the stage for a precise definition of dimension, providing the framework for the rest of the course. Students explore notions of curvature, boundedness, embeddings, and finiteness by constructing models of two-dimensional geometries out of toothpicks, cotton swabs, tape, or whatever works\u2014creativity encouraged! We then apply our findings to the three-dimensional world, exploring advanced concepts from topology and theoretical cosmology with the help of a few video games,\u00a0such as flying a space\u00a0ship\u00a0through hyperbolic space. Finally, we look at the role of fractals in modeling reality, and how they push our notion of dimension to fascinating new horizons.  Course participants gain, in addition to exposure to modern content at the intersection of topology and physical cosmology, an appreciation for rigorous mathematical thinking that is motivated not so much by numbers and quantity as by profound questions about the nature of our world.",

As a consequence, the demand for expertise in AI and machine learning is growing rapidly. This course will enable students to take the first step toward building AI driven applications.  The course\u2019s main topics are:  1. What machine learning, deep learning and AI are.\n 2. When machine learning is the right tool for AI.\n 3. How to select the right machine learning algorithm for your AI scenario.\n 4. How to use Python libraries to build AI applications.\n 5. How to use Automated Machine Learning and Python to build AI applications.\n Real-world AI use cases and applications.\n This course aims at teaching the most important concepts of the machine learning workflow that data scientists follow to build end-to-end data science solutions. We assume that students have basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus.  Students will gain exposure to the theory behind classification, regression, forecasting, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course\u2019s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own. The course includes asynchronous work, which students are expected to complete between class sessions.",

    "course_descr":"In this course, students gain essential skills in critical thinking and written and oral argument by studying several prominent controversies in American law and society. In recent summers these have included free speech and hate speech, immigration and open borders, religious freedom and anti-discrimination law, and abolishing\/defunding the police. In considering each issue, we study texts including legal cases and works in political theory so as to evaluate the meaning and relevance of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, autonomy, and individuality. Course materials also include book excerpts, newspaper and magazine articles, and film clips. Guest speakers from the fields of law, government, and non-profit advocacy join us to provide insights from the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the issues under consideration. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose challenging questions to these guests. Numerous public speaking exercises also help students to become more confident, trained, and effective speakers.\n \n The morning session is generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon session allows participants to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in teams to construct powerful and nuanced arguments. At the end of each unit, students make arguments on various sides of each issue in structured in-class debates and other activities, marshaling ideas from the various sources so as to justify and defend their positions.\n \n By the end of the three weeks, participants are equipped with not only deeper knowledge of the legal and political debates surrounding various key issues but also with the tools to make, understand, critically evaluate, and communicate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their studies and as future citizens and leaders. They come away with more developed reasoning and analytical abilities, and with improved public speaking skills.\n \n Note: While the class focuses on issues within the United States, students from other countries should feel free to apply, as most of the arguments under consideration will also be relevant to contemporary debates in other nations.",

They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.\n \n For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.\n \n Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other\u2019s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.\n \n The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion.\n \n Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other\u2019s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.\n \n The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

Once considered a goal in itself, more recently it has become to be viewed as the fundamental means to world poverty alleviation. Today, about half of the world population still lives on less than $2 \/day. Why? What does it mean to be poor? What are the forces that prevent so many people from enjoying a higher standard of living? The course opens on some fundamental macroeconomic models of economic growth and the recent debate on the geographical or institutional nature of the ultimate causes of growth or arrested development. Then we will move into the most recent microeconomic literature that sheds light on the lives of the poor and on the forces - in particular the market distortions and the market failures - that keep billions in poverty. Among others, we will discuss interesting topics like nutrition and health, the cultural origins of corruption, the effect of global warming, and the design of effective anti-poverty programs.",

It extends the training in the integration of natural science and social science that is a hallmark of the Climate + Society program. It includes training in the construction of a boundary object--a final product--conducted jointly with the client organization; this training includes instruction in project design, implementation and evaluation, and in communication between organizations.",

    "course_descr":"In this course students learn the fundamentals of developing, iterating on, and improving core new business concept ideas. Further, they learn how to estimate sales and potential profitability, mainly through the application of the Booze Allen Sales Estimating System (BASES), the most universal new products and service sales forecasting system globally. Students work in groups to develop new products and marketing plans for those products.\n \n With the help of the Columbia Business School librarian and access to the University\u2019s databases, students learn to quantify the sizes of the target audiences for their new business ideas and find data to support the trends, industry size, and growth, as well as key market segments for the categories they will be entering. Students learn the types of assumptions needed to forecast sales and profitability. They develop and field marketing research questionnaires and interpret the result to improve their new product and service ideas. They also learn the fundamentals of developing launch marketing plans to achieve trial and awareness for the new business introductions.\n \n Participants apply these concepts to Harvard case studies that deal with positioning new products and services amongst competitors, developing launch marketing plans, and adapting new products and services around the world based on local market assessments about category differences, local customs and cultures, values, distribution channels, and intermediaries.\n \n Final in-class presentations allow students to see the course concepts applied to one another\u2019s ideas and industries. The presentations also provide a sense of what venture capitalists and senior management in corporations look for in deciding whether to green light a new product or service for market introduction. The presentations bring the course material together to provide a holistic, real-world view of how the new product and services process works.",

By age 43, Whitman had composed most of his best poetry, published three editions of Leaves of Grass, and left New York only twice. How did the second son of an unsuccessful farmer, a grammar school dropout and hack writer become America\u2019s greatest poet? This course offers a response to this perennial mystery of literary scholarship by proposing that \u201cWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son\u201d was indeed a product of his environment. Coming of age as a writer at the same time the city was emerging as a great metropolis, he received his education and inspiration from New York itself. Course time is equally divided between discussions of Whitman\u2019s antebellum poetry, journalism, and prose (including the newly recovered Life and Adventures of Jack Engle) in their cultural and geographical contexts, and on-site explorations that retread Whitman\u2019s footsteps through Brooklyn and his beloved Mannahatta.

    "course_descr":"\u201cLearned we may be with another man's learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own.\u201d\u2015 Michel de Montaigne \u201cThere is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain. It is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment.\u201d Annie Dillard, The Writing Life \u201cFind a subject you care about and which in your heart you feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\u201d Kurt Vonnegut What makes the essay of personal experience an essay rather than a journal entry? How can one's specific experience transcend the limits of narrative and transmit a deeper meaning to any reader? How can a writer transmit the wisdom gained from personal experience without lecturing her reader? In The Art of the Essay, we explore the answers to these questions by reading personal essays in a variety of different forms. We begin with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher who popularized the personal essay as we know it and famously asked, \u201cWhat do I know?,\u201d and follow the development of the form as a locus of rigorous self-examination, doubt, persuasion, and provocation. Through close reading of a range of essays from writers including Annie Dillard, Salman Rushdie, Jamaica Kincaid, and June Jordan, we analyze how voice, form, and evidence work together to create a world of meaning around an author's experience, one that invites readers into conversations that are at once deeply personal and universal in their consequences and implications.",

An examination of the different forms of staged comedy throughout the centuries, beginning with foundational texts from Ancient Greece, especially Aristophanes. We consider how today's playwrights are still building on, and making reference to, primary works from the Western canon. Texts we will read range from Shakespeare, Jonson and Restoration comedies, to Wilde, Beckett, Hansberry, Tennessee Williams, Pinter, and Churchill. We will also cover contemporary work seen on the stages of New York, including short comic plays, stand up, and physical comedy. Attention will be given to comic characters, comic pretense, wit, humor, comedy of errors, comic gestures, comic archetypes, farce, cross-dressing, satiric comedy, comic relief, tragicomedy, romantic comedy, and theatre of the absurd. This course will be of special interest to serious students of comedy. When possible, class outings make use of current New York City productions.",

Readings will include wordless works by Shaun Tan, classic works by Alison Bechdel, as well as many that may be less familiar. Students will analyze the American, Asian, and European approaches to comics. Guest speakers from the comics industry will aid in developing students' analytical skills.

In addition to our close-readings of the primary cinematic texts, we will pay attention to literary, historical, and anthropological sources on Mafia, both in America and in Italy. In the unit on The Sopranos, we will also consider connections to other contemporary representations of American gangsterism, particularly in the medium of television.

Why and in what way is New York able to breed and feed them? What is complex, intriguing and surprising about these New Yorkers, especially in their connections to each other and this city? By borrowing techniques of characterization and storytelling from fiction and learning some interviewing and research skills from journalism, students in this creative non-fiction writing class will craft portraits of these subjects without exploiting or romanticizing them. Students will write one profile, and build on that into a longer draft of a paper, which will be expanded on in revisions and workshopped in the class with feedback from the instructor and other students. We will read examples of literary journalism from Susan Orlean, Jeff Chang and others, and view some classic New York documentaries.\u00a0  \u00a0  Appropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

Who are the parents? What happened to the baby? Where are the parents selling the shoes? Who will buy them? A work of flash fiction (the very short story) gives us just enough information to suggest narrative and character, while leaving us to fill in the gaps with our imagination. In this workshop, we'll practice the art of the very short story, assessing what makes them evocative and memorable. We'll read very short stories by Jamaica Kincaid, John Edgar Wideman, Lydia Davis, George Saunders, and others, with attention to how these writers create meaning through very few words, while gesturing towards context off the page. We'll practice writing flash fiction with prompts given in class. Writers will come away with not only a toolbox for crafting this short form, but also with strategies for creating vivid scenes in fiction more broadly.  \u00a0  Appropriate for Grade Levels: 9, 10, 11",

Participants are guided through the new venture creation process as applied to student team-selected venture ideas. Through interactive lectures, short case studies, and structured peer activities, students explore the elements of the new venture planning process in an innovative modular format. For each student venture, key issues are addressed in a fashion highly consistent with other formal venture-planning processes including business model development, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, brand development and go-to-market strategies, team selection and management, profit models, financing, and legal considerations.\n \n Students work through a series of structured activities and assignments that correspond with each phase of new venture planning. Throughout the class, they refine their venture\u2019s hypothesized business model on the basis of instructor and peer feedback. At each stage of venture plan development, they learn critical terms, apply tools that support research and decision making, and develop a deep understanding of how each major planning activity fits into formal venture creation. Additionally, they hone critical professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership. By the end of the class, participants have generated robust business models, with supportive venture plan documents, investor pitches, websites, and crowd-funding videos.",

    "course_descr":"This class explores the application of legal principles to advancements in technology, including social media, drones, video games, cryptocurrency, and smartphone apps. In learning about these particular topics, students gain a more general understanding of some of the most important concepts underlying much of U.S. law.\n \n We analyze the law of nuisance and trespass through the lens of Pokemon Go, and we look at the legal concept of negligence by examining product liability issues arising from injuries related to autonomous vehicles and SnapChat filters. The class then explores how the right to privacy is impacted in the physical world by drone technology, and how privacy interests are impacted in the digital world by data gathering platforms such as Facebook. We look at legal issues having to do with the future of money, gaining a basic understanding of blockchain and its role in cryptocurrency and fractional asset ownership through tokenization. Finally, through a study of \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, we explore advertising, marketing, and contract law through a case study of the infamous Fyre Festival.\n \n Students learn through a combination of lecture, discussion, debate, and group work. Content and learning examples are presented in various forms, including PowerPoints, short videos, images, in-class demonstrations, and a guest speaker. Students complete a culminating project involving an oral small group presentation.\n \n Through this immersive learning experience, participants gain a broad understanding of the law as well as enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills. They learn how to approach complex, dynamic legal problems and methodically analyze all relevant factors so as to arrive at logical, evidence-based results. Further, they practice collaborative co-creation and public speaking as they work in small groups on their culminating oral presentations.",

    "course_descr":"This course introduces students to normative ethical theory and applies these theories to several concrete moral issues\n \n Following an orientation in philosophical themes and methods, the course divides into two basic units \u2013 roughly, \u2018theory\u2019 and \u2018practice.\u2019 We first look at the conceptual or theoretical foundations of ethics, surveying four major approaches to ethics in Western philosophy: consequentialism, Kantian ethics, virtue ethics, and the ethics of care.\n \n With these tools in hand, we assess three contemporary moral problems: abortion, freedom of expression and \u2018cancel culture,\" and inequality. We shall be concerned with questions such as: Is abortion morally permissible and, if so, under what conditions? What is freedom of expression, why do we value it, and to what extent should it be limited? What is \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 and to what extent is it, or could it be, morally good or bad? What are the various dimensions of the concept of moral equality? Is it immoral that some people are unequal with respect to resources such as wealth, income, education, and healthcare? In theorizing about justice, is a focus on individual distributive shares of such goods a distraction from practical realities of inequality in race, gender, etc?\n \n Readings are drawn from classical sources such as Aristotle, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Stuart Mill and contemporary philosophers including Peter Singer, Virginia Held, Judith Jarvis Thomson, John Rawls, Elizabeth Anderson, and Tommie Shelby.\n \n Through lecture, independent reading, and class discussion and debate, participants gain a familiarity with some of the fundamental issues in ethics, an understanding of the distinctiveness of philosophical enquiry, and an improved ability to think critically and to express themselves clearly and cogently.",

Readings, screenings, the analysis of clips and full-length movies, as well as hands-on exercises such as storyboarding, blocking, shooting, and editing a scene all combine to convey the excitement and artistry of film.\n \n Week One:\n \n Students learn how motion pictures developed their own language\u2014their own, universally understood visual system of representation\u2014by studying the masters of early and contemporary cinema: the edge-of-your-seat last minute rescue scenes of D.W. Griffith; the bravura long takes of Jean Renoir; the nail-biting tension created by Quentin Tarantino; and the nerve-tingling suspense that is the hallmark of Alfred Hitchcock. Beginning with a storyboard, students will try their hand at conceptualizing a scene from start to finish in the style of classical Hollywood cinema.\n \n Week Two:\n \n Having learned Hollywood\u2019s tricks of the trade, we branch out into international cinema, where other nations developed different systems of representation\u2014their own languages\u2014that challenged but also inspired the American film industry. Meet the Soviet style of filmmaking that revolutionized cinema in every sense of the word; the Gothic excess of German Expressionism, whose use of lighting, setting, and costume echoes in all contemporary horror flicks; and the bold surrealism of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Salvador Dali, and Maya Deren, whose cinematic experiments impact on dream sequences to the present day. Each student writes a review of one contemporary American film that owes a debt to foreign cinema\u2014or vice versa.\n \n Week Three:\n \n Putting it all together, Week Three culminates in group analyses of some of the masterworks of classical and contemporary cinema such as Citizen Kane, Run, Lola, Run and La La Land. We examine and discuss the ways in which sound and image, editing, and the elements of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne combine to create transporting cinematic experiences that have the ability to make audiences cry, experience fear, feel empathy and joy and, above all, marvel at the magic of movies.\n \n Daily readings include film reviews and essays on film analysis, technique and history. Students are also responsible for an oral presentation on a specific scene, film, or director of their choice.\n \n Please be aware that some of the films viewed contain violence and mature subje",

The TV Writing Intensive is a six-week, concentrated and encompassing introduction into the field of television writing designed to prepare students to join the professional worlds of half-hour comedies and one-hour dramas across network, cable and digital platforms. In an interconnected program consisting of two intensive writing workshops and a lecture series with guest writers and producers, students gain the knowledge and authority to explore, examine and create the kind of groundbreaking work that is taking over television here and around the world. Participants in The Television Writing Intensive learn about half-hour comedy and one-hour drama by writing and developing spec scripts and original pilots. A spec script is a teleplay for an existing show where the writer brings original stories to existing characters. A pilot is a script written for an original series that the writer creates. This intensive course meets 15 hours per week. On Mondays and Wednesdays students will attend the writing courses outlined above. Thursday evenings students will attend seminars with professors and other industry professionals.",

In this seminar we will compare different national and regional contexts of contemporary documentary production, including projects created within the media industries of Mexico, Peru, India, China, Cambodia, and Israel. We will also examine how documentaries resonate locally, but can still transcend geographic borders and engage viewers across the globe. Crucial to our course will be the close analysis of how documentaries actively address civil rights struggles, oppressive government regimes, cultural trends, environmental crises, and progressive social movements to create more inclusive, equitable communities. So, too, will we examine emerging technologies (such as VR\/AR), strategies of international co-production, star-studded film festivals, as well as the global reach and impact of mega studios such as Netflix and Wanda.

What role does the stock market play and how does it function? What factors govern stock market behavior and lead to market booms and busts? How is the price of a company\u2019s stock determined and how does it affect individual investors? This challenging course introduces the basic financial principles necessary to understand the role of the stock market in our economy and in our personal lives.\n \n Class time is divided between lecture and lab. Participants assume the role of money managers in order to gain an understanding of financial markets as they manage their own portfolio of stocks in a session-long stock market simulation game. Stock options and future contracts are added to the portfolio as the managers gain market expertise. Financial theories presented in class lectures, news of current and world events, and analysis of company reports are incorporated as the new money managers develop strategies to test their understanding of the market for stocks.",

Students learn about the materials and techniques that artists use as well as the historical contexts in which they operate. While we look closely at specific artworks using the tools of formal analysis, we also discuss the different methodologies art historians use to interpret the social and cultural meanings these artworks contain.The goal of this class is to examine artworks while encouraging students to think about the choices that artists make as well as how these objects reflect and embody their specific cultures and time periods. While the course proceeds chronologically, it is not a historical survey; instead, each unit is a case study of a particular moment in the history of Western art and visual culture.",

Instead of surveying the history of architecture, we look at specific New York landmarks so as to understand how great structures not only fulfill practical needs but also influence our relationship to the physical and social world around us. By studying some of the city's notable museums, parks, houses of worship, office buildings, and transportation centers, we see how these sites reflect and inform different kinds of social experiences. Students become familiar with basic architectural vocabulary (such as light, space, mass, and circulation) and come to appreciate how architects of different eras and sensibilities have engaged these same elements to different ends.\n \n We examine historical and current images of key buildings and places, discuss their essential role in urban life, and identify significant events which have made them memorable. We also consider how their portrayal in popular culture has contributed to New York\u2019s identity and image as an American city and a global destination.\n \n Some of the sites we consider typically include Columbia University\u2019s campus, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, Lever House, and the 9\/11 Memorial.",

We study the New York School of Poetry, Painting, Theatre, Dance and Music; French influences on the repertory of American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet; the Paris Opera Ballet; the contributions of American choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown on French dance; and the theatrical impulse in recent French contemporary dance. We will make use of French critical theory ( Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Barthes, Proust, and the work of recent French feminists) to understand how distinct cultures create differing notions of the expressive body. These texts will also help us to see how individual and social movement patterns are created on the stages and in the streets of metropolitan Paris and New York City. The course will include virtual viewings of selected performances. The course will be conducted in English. No prerequisites.",

New discoveries are happening almost every day.\u00a0 In this course we will explore the basic elements of molecular biology, genetics and evolution and how these sciences affect modern medicine and agriculture. The course starts with a full description of the structure, function and synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein. The students are then asked to apply the knowledge of these topics to a wide range of biological topics \u00a0including modern biological research techniques, data interpretation, genetic engineering, immunology, cancer and virology. The course will also include mini-talks that connect biology to other academic fields.\u00a0 A variety of online group activities and videos are also part of the experience.",

The course enables students to understand, speak, read, and write in German about a range of subjects: family activities, studies, work and home life, as well as travel, economics, and current events. Classes are conducted entirely in German and supplemented with written homework and audiovisual materials. Assignments and activities are diversified to integrate undergraduate and graduate students\u2019 academic and personal interests. The program draws on the German heritage of New York City (museums, Goethe Institut, restaurants, etc.). Students are encouraged to attend German-language films and musical performances. Students have many opportunities for informal conversation. Upon successful completion of the course (with a minimum grade of B), students should achieve novice high to intermediate low proficiency (ACTFL scale). Final grades are based on frequent oral and written tests, writing assignments, a project on German culture in New York, and a final examination. Students are advised that this course constitutes a full-time commitment. The workload of this course is very intense and students will be expected to spend 4-6 hours studying every day outside of class and additional time on weekends. The Department of Germanic Languages will assist in selecting the appropriate course. Equivalent to the combination of GERM UN1101 and UN1102 taught during the regular semesters.",

We will discuss how economic development was initially seen through the lenses of moral philosophy as a civilizing process but was also destined for exhaustion because of the limits of nature and the finite endowment of land. We will examine how the Industrial Revolution marked a major shift in perspective and turned capitalism and economic growth into virtually unbounded processes. A major focus of the course will be on the Twentieth Century. We will explore how the development discourse has been transformed in a global context by different actors, and how it has intersected with other issues such as inequality, environmentalism, war and security, and social dynamics such as the role of women. We will discuss the peculiarities of specific periods and approaches, but we will also learn to recognize the recurrent themes and debates that are still lively today.",

    "course_descr":"Even before the U.S. existed as a republic, people from 'Hispanic' and Indo-America have been incorporated into the culture, history, life, and occupational fabric of the United States. Yet, forces, figures, and factions in larger society frequently perceived Latin American heritage people as members of an 'alien' culture. Through histories of coercion, migration, labor recruitment, family networks, religious conversion, wars of occupation, economic need, political exile, education inequities, electoral participation, and unimaginative representations in film, fiction, and broader popular culture, millions of people from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, and the rest of Latin America have somehow become American, while still remaining outside the national community. This 3-point undergraduate lecture course will examine the process of departure and arrival-the historical forces pushing and pulling people from Latin America to the United States. We will also examine how 'Spanish,' 'Latins,' 'Hispanics,' and 'Latinos' adjust, integrate, assimilate, resist, and adapt to the many forces that affect their lives in the U.S. over the last century and a half, creating new ethnic, racial and local identities in the process. By studying the experience of Latinos\/as and Latin American immigrants with an eye toward patterns of second-class citizenship, identity formation, ethnic culture, community maturation, labor struggles, and social mobility, we will map out the heterogeneous mosaic of Latin American and Caribbean diasporas in the U.S. Due in large part to ongoing immigration from Mexico, the Mexican-origin population has grown appreciably from approximately 100,000 at the turn of the twentieth century to thirty-five million today (10% of the overall U.S. population and about 65% of the collective Latino community). We shall therefore pay special attention to what ethnic Mexicans, their offspring, and other Americans have had to say about the Mexican American experience and its effects on Latino\/a social life as well as the nation's economy, society, and culture. Naturally, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Central\/South American communities in the United States will be examined as well. The study of Latino history is a young discipline, with many gaps and grey areas. It also exists in a complex and tense dialogue (often a monologue) within broader U.S. history.

Authors will be examined according to their historical context and their role in the tradition of political thought and the history of radical politics from 1848 to the mid-sixties.

Working from the notion that sport is \u201cmore than a game,\u201d the class will examine the social, economic, cultural, and political impact of sports in distinct hemispheric American contexts from the late 19th century until the present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the course encourages students to examine sports in other local, national, and transnational settings. During the summer session we will focus on three themes that exemplify the ways the sporting realm illuminates some of the pressing problems of our time: the conflicts engendered by the staging of mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup; the impact of sports on the implementation of Title IX, and understandings of gender and sexuality; and football\u2019s impact on the evolution of masculine identities in the U.S. Course materials include works by historians, sociologists, social theorists, and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies.",

This seminar will introduce students to different structures of global governance for development, trade, labor, finance, the environment, migration, and intellectual property and investigate their relationship with human rights. Students will learn about public, private, and mixed forms of governance, analyze the ethical and strategic perspectives of the various stakeholders and relate them to existing human rights norms.

We will use case studies ranging in time from the early modern period (practices in which the body was marked to measure criminality, for example), to the present day. Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images. Subjects to be addressed include: the nature of evidence; documentation and witness; censorship; iconoclasm; surveillance; profiling; advocacy images; signs on the body; visibility and invisibility.",

And yet, according to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s (SG) annual report on children and armed conflict last year armed conflicts around the world led to at least 4,000 verified rights violations against children committed by government forces and over 11,500 by non-state militant groups. The violations include killing or maiming, recruitment or use of children in hostilities, sexual violence, using children as human bombs, abductions, the denial of humanitarian access, and attacks on schools and hospitals. About 50 percent of the estimated 26 million people currently displaced by armed conflicts and violence are children. According to UNICEF, 2017 was one of the worst years for children caught in conflicts and besieged areas. From being deployed as human shields to acting as suicide bombers, children have become targets on a vast scale.",

    "course_descr":"Are human rights still relevant in promoting social justice and freedom in the 21st Century? Human rights law and advocacy have been central to international politics since the end of World War II. However, recent rises in authoritarianism and anti-liberal regimes have raised new questions on whether the human rights framework is still capable of addressing injustices in the modern world. This course introduces students to the law and practice of human rights as well as the challenges of enforcing rights in an international environment that has grown increasingly hostile to principles of human dignity and personal freedom.\n \n In the first part of the course, students review the philosophical foundations of human rights and then examine human rights from two perspectives. First, the legal perspective introduces them to basic principles and rules of international law and the main international organizations and mechanisms designed for promoting and enforcing human rights. Second, they adopt the role of social scientist. We debate evidence on the effectiveness of human rights law and discuss challenges of enforcing rights in an international system in which states are not accountable to a higher authority.\n \n In the second part of the course, students apply their new knowledge to the problems facing human rights today. Topics include cultural relativist critiques of human rights as a Western, neo-colonialist institution, challenges from new technologies in state surveillance and autonomous weapons, and existential threats to human populations through climate change and environmental damage.\n \n Each day participants are required to read college-level academic literature on the law and practice of human rights and engage with new ideas through group discussion and activities. The primary assignment for this course is participation in an international moot court activity, which challenges students to research and give oral arguments on a fictitious human rights case.\n \n The course also introduces students to several different perspectives through a variety of guest lecturers.",

The course emphasizes drawing from both observation and imagination as ways to learn traditional and digital drawing techniques and foster creativity and personal interpretation. Course assignments develop the use of traditional drawing materials alongside conceptual prompts to find creative approaches to visual problem-solving. Assignments include exercises in composition and experiments with scale, the development of personal narrative and subject matter, and the use of charcoal as well as animated digital tools, all with personalized attention from the instructor.\n \n The course combines demonstrations of drawing techniques, individual conferences with the instructor as well as online group critiques, and virtual studio visits with professional artists. Critical issues in art are addressed once a week through group writing prompts and online discussion, so as to generate meaningful debates as a context for studio work.\n \n Participants learn how to prepare a final portfolio for college applications and are instructed on how to professionally document and present their work. The session concludes with a final drawing project, in which the students work on animating and editing as a group. A final blog will house a virtual exhibit, and work is shared within the community on a social media platform.",

Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today\u2019s venture success stories.\n \n Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching \u201cshark tank\u201d style in front of a group of experts.\n \n Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.\n \n Upon successful completion of the course, participants will have created fully realizable business models. They will have also honed key professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.",

    "course_descr":"This course is intended for students interested in learning the fundamentals of the innovation and development process that gives rise to ventures in both the commercial and social worlds. Through a combination of real-world examples and hands-on exercises, participants experience the entrepreneurial journey that has given rise to many of today\u2019s venture success stories.\n \n Blending theory and practice through interactive lectures, case studies, group work, and visits from experienced entrepreneurs, the course gives students as close to a real life venture creation experience as possible. We cover all the essential aspects to building a successful venture, including creating a business model, customer discovery, product-market validation, in-depth industry and market analysis, product or service innovation, go-to-market strategy, financing, and finally pitching \u201cshark tank\u201d style in front of a group of experts.\n \n Working together in teams, participants work through the modules of the venture creation process. For each of the components, they follow a scientific approach whereby they create hypotheses which are then proven or pivoted using experiments and feedback from the instructor, visiting experts, and peers. They learn research methods for formulating well-supported hypotheses, acquire decision-making tools, and develop a deep understanding of how each planning activity fits into formal venture creation. They also practice their articulation skills at regular intervals so that they are ready to present their ventures in the capstone pitch sessions.\n \n Upon successful completion of the course, participants will have created fully realizable business models. They will have also honed key professional skills including creative problem-solving, communication and negotiation, project management, financial analysis, and collaborative leadership.",

    "course_descr":"As smartphones and tablets continue to offer increasingly sophisticated capabilities, filmmakers have begun to turn to their mobile devices for both small and feature-scale projects. From Sean Baker\u2019s Sundance feature film, Tangerine, to the Oscar-winning feature documentary, Searching for Sugar Man, mobile filmmaking has proven to be an exciting and innovative method of filmmaking.\n \n Students in this intensive course use their iPhones or iPads to create strong, visually-driven short films with an emphasis on narrative storytelling. In the process, they learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.\n \n In the first few days, participants learn the basic principles of mobile cinematography and gain hands-on experience as they progress from equipment assembly to on-set production protocol. They learn how to unlock the filmmaking potential of their mobile phones\/tablets while taking on various key roles in the different projects - directing, cinematography, editing, and\/or sound \u2013 so that each student experiences different facets of film crewing.\n \n In the second half of the class, students work together through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, final shooting, and editing. The instructor provides guidance throughout the process, emphasizing the students\u2019 responsibility for carrying the project from inception to completion. In addition to film production guidance, the instructor provides practical information regarding the film industry and film schools\/career paths\n \n On the last day of the class, participants screen their completed films for review. These films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications..\n \n Students should arrive on the first day of class with short film ideas ready to pitch; the films are made collaboratively as group projects, so we will be able to use only some of the ideas.",

And when it comes to new opportunities such as bitcoin, driverless vehicles, and artificial intelligence, here too insurance plays a key role in enabling innovation and supporting growth and prosperity.  In this course we examine the inner workings of one of the most valuable financial services for society. The first insurance policy was written 670 years ago. Today, the ten largest insurers in the world generate over $918 billion in net written premium and hold $7 trillion in non-banking assets. Course participants gain a deep appreciation as to why individuals and businesses rely on insurance as a powerful financial tool, and come to understand the value that insurance provides to society.  Through lectures, role play, case studies, and group projects, students come to understand:  \n  \nHow insurance is responding to modern threats such as climate change, cyber-attack, coronavirus, and natural disasters.\n  \nHow insurance is evolving to accommodate driverless vehicles, bitcoin, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotization, 5G, aging populations, and longer life spans.\n  \nWhy insurance is a financial necessity in a global economy.\n  \nHow to utilize insurance as a financial tool.\n  \nHow insurance companies make money and balance it with paying claims.\n  \nHow risks are monetized and transferred.\u00a0\n  \nHow insurance helps to stimulate economic growth.\n  \nThe economic advantages of pooling exposures.\n  \nHow insurance has evolved over time.\n \n  Participants gain a clear understanding of how the insurance industry operates, why it is needed, and how it will continue to emerge to meet the risk demands of the future.",

At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --\u00e2\u20ac fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.",

Through a comparison with the West, students will inquire whether a unique approach is required when considering appropriate responses to security issues in East Asia.",

    "course_descr":"Conflict is a part of life. Most people do not like conflict because they usually do not resolve their conflicts well and so they develop a distaste for it. There are also ways to constructively engage in conflict that lead to better quality outcomes and relationships. In this course, students learn basic concepts about conflict resolution so that they can develop a deeper and broader understanding of conflict dynamics. There are many types of conflicts and in this course the students focus on learning more about their interpersonal conflicts with others. They learn skills so they will be able to more constructively resolve their interpersonal conflicts toward win-win outcomes.\n \n These goals are achieved by students developing more self-awareness as to the types of conflict styles they tend to use as their \u201cdefault\u201d approach. They become more aware of their \u201chot buttons\u201d and the types of behaviors and situations that cause them to become embroiled in a conflict situation. In addition to learning more about their own habits, they apply these concepts and skills to better understand others around them. By developing more empathy and understanding of others, students are able to reduce the number, types, and intensity of their interpersonal conflicts.\n \n The course is primarily experiential and interactive so students learn by doing and reinforce their learning through immediate application. There are role-plays, simulations, discussions, presentations, film analyses, and other activities designed to enhance learning of the identified concepts and skills.",

They learn a wide range of elementary film production techniques and build a technical and aesthetic foundation structured around film grammar, story development, script writing, sound, and editing.\n \n Students begin by learning the elements of digital filmmaking with video exercises that start off simply at first, adding a new element of filmmaking with each new assignment until they advance to a final film project.\n \n For the final film, students work sequentially through the stages of production: initial concept, synopsis, treatment, script, storyboards, and final shooting and editing. During pre-production they learn how to plan for and realize a short film from concept to shooting script. During production, they coordinate and shoot their script. In post-production, they edit and polish their projects collaboratively, sharing feedback on scripts and cuts.\n \n Classes include both lectures and workshops, in which students thoughtfully critique and learn from each other\u2019s work. Course instructors provide, in addition to guidance on film production, practical information regarding the film industry, film schools, and career paths.\n \n The completed films can potentially be used for submission to short film festivals and as portfolio pieces for film or art school applications.",

    "course_descr":"War Reporting: The Coverage of Armed Conflict explores the origins and roles of modern war reporting, examines the challenges journalists face, and discusses journalism's place in the public discourse of armed conflict and political violence, most notably terrorism. Taught by U.S. Marine corps veteran and Pulitzer Prize winning reporter and author, C.J. Chivers, class discussions will be lively and require student engagement. There will be guest lectures and seminars with leading journalists with experience in recent wars, as well discussions with security and legal professionals who assist and guide news organizations in their coverage of war. The examination of risks to journalists on conflict beats will include detailed case studies of real kidnappings and battlefield deaths, and study examples of risk mitigation and best practices in the field. The course is intended for students with a deep interest in war, terrorism and journalism, including both news consumers and aspiring practitioners. It aims to promote skepticism of official narratives and critical thinking about journalism itself.",

If not, then how can we know that this is not the case \u2013 what is our evidence or justification for ruling out, with certainty, such a scenario? What, if any, are the implications of skeptical scenarios for more ordinary knowledge \u2013 what, if anything, can we, as believers aiming at knowledge, learn from such apparently fantastic and improbable hypotheses? And would it make any ethical difference \u2013 would our lives be better or worse off, and in what ways \u2013 if we actually are living in the Matrix?\n \n In attempting to answer these questions, we read selections from philosophical classics such as Plato\u2019s Republic and Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 Meditations, as well as articles by contemporary philosophers David Mitsuo Nixon and Jim Pryor.\n \n This course has three aims: 1) to introduce students to key themes in philosophy, particularly metaphysics and epistemology, and in so doing to show how an apparently abstruse discipline is of surprising relevance to our lives; 2) to provide students with essential tools for understanding the nature of logical reasoning and evaluating arguments; 3) to sharpen students\u2019 abilities to express themselves clearly and cogently, in writing and especially in speaking.\n \n Beyond thoughtful reading and active participation, students are expected to complete several short and informal writing exercises, in part as a warm-up for a longer concluding reflection on key course themes.",

Who gets admitted to elite institutions, and what factors should they consider? Faculties have tenure to protect their right to challenge conventional wisdom, but what exactly does Academic Freedom protect? Students have the right to free speech, or do they? Can a college censor a student newspaper? If a student is disciplined on campus, do they have a right to an attorney? Do students have a property interest in their education that can cost over $100,000? How does the law treat private and public institutions differently? This course is designed to explore the most controversial of constitutional topics including the First Amendment right to free speech, the Fifth Amendment's takings clause, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection, procedural due process and substantive due process in regards to life, liberty, and property.",

Through substantive instruction related to first-year law school courses, LSAT test prep information, and information about licensing requirements, students develop an appreciation of what is required to \u2018get in, get through and get out\u2019 of an American law school.\n \n Presentations by attorneys representing a range of practice areas impart a \u201creal world\u201d perspective about law as it is practiced in the corporate, government, and non-profit sectors.\n \n Participants engage in fundamental legal research and writing assignments. They participate in debates and mock trial and moot court related tasks, enhancing public speaking skills. These various exercises are intended to provide each student with a collection of transferrable skills, helping to make them more \u201cmarketable\u201d as they move toward college and career.\n \n A culminating collaborative practicum project is an opportunity for students to employ their knowledge so as to develop and present a law-based solution to a specific social issue of interest to them.",

    "course_descr":"This course examines five intriguing areas of linguistics that relate to crucial 21st Century social issues. Starting with fossils and skulls, we explore where language came from, how it evolved, and how it differs from animal communication. Next, we look at language variation (in the form of accents, dialect, and slang) and imposed linguistic policies (such as spelling) that manipulate our native abilities to communicate. We move onto pragmatics, the study of how language use varies based on context, audience, formality, speaker intentionality, and even gender identity. Next, we explore language taboos (curse words, censorship) and language prestige (the social value placed on different speaking styles). We finish with an analysis of the Internet's impact on language (memes, texting, the possible decline of \"proper\" English, and the limitations of AI communication).\n \n Students work in the morning with texts, lectures, and films, covering the principles of linguistics and the relevant literature. In the afternoon, they problem-solve by working through case studies and analyzing linguistic evidence via databases and other web resources. Guest speakers who are active in their fields add a level of detail and specificity to the course.\n \n Participants gain a deeper understanding of the role of language in their society and linguistics as an interdisciplinary tool for greater insight into how we live.",

The course is structured like a traditional introductory first-year law school class.\n \n Students learn first to use the methods and tools of legal reasoning and research, which they marshal to create effective, persuasive, and sophisticated written legal arguments. Once they have a foundation in legal research, reasoning, and writing, they are given an in-depth look at various types of law through interactive sessions with practicing lawyers, via guest speakers and field trips to law firms. They learn about the trial process and the inner workings of the court system by taking a tour of a New York City court and viewing a criminal trial. They learn how to problem solve using the lawyer\u2019s toolbox and how to analyze legal sources and develop legal arguments based on and supported by the law and cases we research.\n \n In-class drafting and public speaking exercises strengthen participants\u2019 reasoning, argumentation, and writing skills while introducing them to various types of legal work, including written memoranda and arguments for oral delivery. Students work in class on preparing legal memoranda of law on specified topics. After the final draft, they pair up to argue against each other in a formal court oral argument setting.",

    "course_descr":"This course explores a broad range of questions concerning the relationship between the media and politics, with a focus on historical and contemporary issues presented in the American context: Do the news media educate or manipulate the citizenry? What is the role of the press in a democracy and how does the First Amendment protect the press in the United States? What has the impact been of the new information technologies on the traditional media and on the political role of citizens? Against the backdrop of these questions, we critically assess the political significance of social media and the increasing \u201cweaponization\u201d of information. In particular, we examine the extent to which these new developments limit the ability of citizens to participate meaningfully in society and politics, while at the same time challenging longstanding assumptions about the role of journalism and political communication in America\u2019s system of democratic government.\n \n Students engage with course material through a combination of readings, lectures, daily discussions, films, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in small teams to create a hypothetical media proposal for selected candidates running in the 2020 New York City Mayoral Race. This will involve doing research on target constituencies, developing a persuasive message, and designing an effective media plan that matches specific messages to appropriate audiences and platforms.\n \n The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper understanding of the factors that characterize effective communication strategies, and to equip them with the tools necessary to be more intelligent, critical consumers of all forms of political communication.",

In this course we explore the centrality of the media as a force challenging and, in some cases, altering relations of power within and between societies. Starting from the premise that freedom of expression is a fundamental requirement for any truly democratic system, particular attention is given to how approaches to media and politics vary globally, and how these differences impact the way politicians, journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens operate within the broader political process.\n \n We critically examine the impact of political communication on policy-making, elections, and political movements, with the goal of developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between citizens, media, and governments in a rapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world. In so doing, we investigate the connection between media and current political trends and conflicts around the world, including, but not limited to, the United States, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Asia.\n \n Students engage with the course material through a combination of lectures, daily discussions, short essays, group research projects, and guest speakers from the worlds of journalism and politics. Participants also work in teams to create media campaigns designed to generate greater public awareness and support for a hypothetical non-governmental organization (NGO), developing their own mission statements, messaging strategies, and targeted media plans.",

Materials determine the technologies that provide protection, communication, information, construction, mechanization, agriculture, and health. Knowing why glass shatters, wood splinters, steel is tough, rubber stretches and recovers, nylon can be drawn, and tin flattens, makes possible the selection of materials for enormously different applications.\n \n This challenging course is designed for students who want to deepen their understanding of the relationship between the nano- and microstructure of a material and its bulk physical and chemical properties.\n \n The daily program follows a seminar format, beginning with a morning online discussion about specific materials, including animations and thematic videos, and culminating with afternoon online research presentations by faculty from Columbia University, sister academic institutions, industry, and National Laboratories.\n \n Through individual and collaborative audio-visual assignments and class discussions, students learn to:\n \n Differentiate between metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials\n Search academic and professional journals and properly cite scientific work\n Perform effectively in a group setting by actively participating in discussions\n Discover the ethical implications of materials science in societal and global decision-making\n Demonstrate problem-solving and critical thinking skills to evaluate the applications of a given material based on its nano- and microstructure properties\n Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions and research seminars, complete a collaborative research project, and present their project in class.",

Why has Latin America, a region rich in natural resources, not been able to attain economic growth levels similar to those in Asia? What implications does a potential global water crisis pose to how nations interact with one another? How has the mix of traditional and renewable energy sources made an impact on the United States? Is it unethical to apply economic principles to natural resources?\n \n This course examines these type of questions as it dives into the fundamentals of natural resources, their pivotal role in the development of OECD (Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD economies, and the monetization impact from Wall Street to the end consumer on Main Street.\n \n Through case study analyses of current events, students develop an understanding of global reserves and yields of natural resources, identify world consumers and producers \u2013 i.e. export (supply\/origin) and import (demand\/destination) hubs \u2013 along with transportation channels, and conduct deep dive analyses in group settings on the financial life of these resources and their contribution to the pace of global growth.\n \n Complementary to these topics, participants debate the basis for responsible business procurement of natural resources \u2013 including those that are sustainable \u2013 and their effect in the global landscape.\n \n Students gain an understanding of \u2013 and think critically about \u2013 various natural resources (agricultural, energy, mineral, and livestock) and the key challenges of international trade in an interconnected world. They also learn about the social impact of exploration and production of these raw materials. Topics explored include the relevance of geopolitical analysis, how shipping markets and freight rates\/chartering are crucial to world trade, and the growing presence of private capital in shoring up global imbalances.",

Participants learn how to deal with the rising tide of neuroscientific information being proffered in litigation and in the legal policy context. They see how research studies are used in contexts outside the laboratory and are challenged to critically assess and evaluate not only the scientific principles but also their legal and ethical implications.\n \n The course focuses on brain functioning as it influences behavior and responsibility principles. The legal principle of culpable conduct and its implications are addressed, and appropriate penalties and punishment for criminal conduct are discussed. Students are asked to address fundamental questions about what it means to be morally and legally responsible, and what, if anything, neuroscience can provide to our assessments of individual responsibility for actions.\n \n Discussions transition from case-specific inquiries to first principles, namely: How do the separate domains of law, science, and behavior relate to one another? What are the purposes and roles of law in society? How may science help or hinder those purposes? And what can science tell us about behavior that might be legally relevant, and how?\n \n Some of the topics that may be addressed include the Frye and Daubert standards for the admissibility of expert testimony, objective assessments of subjective complaints of pain, inaccurate eyewitness testimony, cross-racial witness identification, applicable jury instructions employing principles of science, memory and emotion, lie detection, adolescent brain function and implications for sentencing and criminal liability, addiction, artificial intelligence, and cognitive enhancements.\n \n The course requires daily reading and active class participation; it is taught in a law school format, using the Socratic method. Assigned readings include scientific studies and articles from medical journals as well as prominent legal cases, including some lengthy U.S. Supreme Court decisions.",

How does the City grow from its origins as a peripheral colonial outpost into a world capital? This overview explores New York's complicated historical origins, dynamic economy, tumultuous politics, multiethnic and multiracial populace, and innovative architecture as a basis for the rest of the course. We also examine how human biological and neuroscientific development play a crucial role in the development of the city. Students are exposed to methods of field study, visual analysis, and critical interpretation.\n \n Writing the City\n How is our understanding of New York \u2013 its projected image and self-image \u2013 shaped by literature about the city? How does the culture of the city exist outside of its boundaries? How has the city\u2019s history shaped popular culture? Using short stories, poems, popular songs, journalism, and essays, students investigate the connection between the city and the manner in which it has been exported as a cultural icon.\n \n NYC Systems and Community\n The city exists as a series of overlapping systems; transportation, businesses, living areas, even cell phone towers and sewers all exist in close proximity, and often in tension with each other. It is a vibrant ecosystem: people, pets, rodents, pigeons, bacteria, and viruses competing for resources in close quarters. It has also been a place in which humans have encountered and conquered a significant number of biological challenges. Using systems thinking, students examine the community of New York as an ecosystem with a rich and ancient evolutionary past.\n \n How do we exist in concert or tension with so many competing interests? The answer here defines our community - what we value and what we don\u2019t. How do we evaluate what, or who, is valued in our community? How do our brains frame the way we interact with our community? This overview takes into account an evolutionary lens when diving into historical and contemporary examples of how the communities in New York have worked together or experienced tension.\n \n Urban Place Design\n What places make for an inclusive, successful, lively, and resilient city? We study various answers to this question \u2013 public\/private part",

    "course_descr":"This course is designed for students who want to engage in lively debate on a philosopher's ideas, closely read primary texts, and investigate how philosophical concepts are present in our experiences today. In the process of delving into key philosophical texts about love, human excellence, and existential freedom, course participants are familiarized with the basic methodology of philosophical enquiry.\n \n We begin by reading and discussing Plato's Symposium and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, their respective treatises on love and moral character (virtue ethics). Students debate questions related to the dialogue on love that Plato develops through the voice and character of Socrates. What is love and what does it mean to be a lover of wisdom\u2014a philosopher? In the Ethics, students discuss the topic of human excellence and seek to answer how humans should best live their lives. In a practical sense, what is the purpose of human life and what is the ultimate goal of human endeavor? Why does Aristotle consider friendship a virtue, an excellence one must pursue if one wants a good life, Eudaemonia?\n \n Having established the classical foundations, we move into the 20th Century and begin a dialogue and exploration of ideas on existential freedom, choice, and responsibility. We begin with readings to explore the ideas of determinism and indeterminism associated with various philosophies of freedom. Specifically, we focus on the foundational works of Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s concept of existential freedom found in Being and Nothingness and Soren Kierkegaard\u2019s religious freedom from Fear and Trembling, which Donald Palmer introduces in Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy. This introduction serves as the foundation students need in order to grasp the idea of existential freedom articulated in the essays that make up Albert Camus' seminal work The Myth of Sisyphus. Through this lens students will debate whether it is practical to attempt to live an existential life and how philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Camus, and Sartre would define that life.\n \n In addition to the readings, participants will have an opportunity to critique film and other art forms that present interpretations of existential themes.",

What are the different types of consciousness and how, if at all, are they related? How do we know that beings besides ourselves possess mentality? Can robots possess minds?\n \n We explore these questions via a philosophical analysis of a number of attempts to explain the nature of the mind and mentality. The course begins with dualist attempts to characterize the mind as a non-physical soul that possesses immaterial mental states such as beliefs and hopes, and proceeds to an investigation of recent efforts to understand the mind and mentality as physical phenomena. Some historically influential answers to the question what is a mind and what is mentality? are critically assessed, including (i) substance dualism, (ii) mind-brain identity theory, and (iii) functionalism. In the latter part of the course, issues such as the nature of consciousness as well as how to make sense of the causal efficacy of mentality are discussed.\n \n Course readings include such influential works as Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Meditations on First Philosophy, J.J.C. Smart's \"Sensations and Brain Processes,\u201d Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Mental States,\u201d and Thomas Nagel\u2019s \u201cWhat is it Like to be a Bat?\u201d Course activities include class debates, group presentations, the designing of thought experiments, critical writing exercises, and close textual analysis.\n \n The broad goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 analytical reading and writing skills, while the more specific objectives are to give them a solid understanding of issues in the philosophy of mind as well as an understanding of the methods of philosophy.",

The simulated patients are complex patients, who can be ambiguous, unpredictable and difficult to manage due to patient-related characteristics, e.g. comorbidities across multiple clinical domains, or contextual factors. Students are required to apply primarily the four types of clinical reasoning that they learn in the Clinical Case Management course (a concurrent course running in the same semester) while the simulated patient cases unfold in class. The four types of clinical reasoning are hypothetico-deductive reasoning, pattern recognition, collaborative reasoning and ethical reasoning. The lecture portion of the course will focus on the patient-client management for individuals with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, with an emphasis on the complex post-surgical inpatient interventions including but not limited to LVAD, interventional cardiology, lung reduction for COPD, and lung\/cardiac transplantation",

It will cover basic data analysis and statistical methods, from univariate and bivariate descriptive and inferential statistics through multivariate regression analysis. Computer applications will be emphasized. The course will focus largely on observational data used in cross-sectional statistical analysis, but it will consider issues of research design more broadly as well. It will assume that students have no mathematical background beyond high school algebra and no experience using computers for data analysis.",

    "course_title":"Political and Economic Ideologies of the",
    "course_descr":"This course explores the central political, economic, and social ideologies of the modern world, including capitalism, socialism, communism, liberalism, populism, and nationalism. We ask what principles define these ideologies, how these ideologies intersect with democracy, and how they produce and require different meanings and understandings of key concepts such as freedom, equality, justice, and citizenship.  Starting with an extended focus on capitalism and liberal democracy, students investigate the origins and key beliefs of each ideology and think about the pros and cons of various systems of governance and social control. Our goal is not to proclaim any one ideology as superior, but to more deeply understand different ways of thinking about politics and society that have shaped the past and present, and that offer us possibilities for the future. In the process, class participants become more reflective about and aware of their own convictions, and better able to articulate and defend such convictions in speech and writing with thoughtfulness, precision, insight, and persuasive force.  Course materials include excerpts from classic and contemporary political theory texts, as well as newspaper and magazine articles and film clips. Students draft and revise personal ideology statements and participate in debates in which they marshal ideas from the sources studied to justify and defend their positions.  The course also includes guest speakers representing various ideological positions. Students are encouraged to engage in serious dialogue with and pose difficult questions of these guests, probing what they believe and why.  The morning sessions are generally devoted to helping students achieve a firm grasp of the theoretical and factual arguments found in the readings, through a combination of presentations by the instructor and class discussion. The afternoon sessions allow students to put these theories and facts to work in written and oral form, working both individually and in small groups to develop arguments and debate controversial political questions.  By the end of the three weeks, students are equipped with not only a deeper understanding of the competing political and economic ideologies that shape the modern world, but also with the tools to make, understand, and critically evaluate claims of all kinds\u2014tools which should serve them well both in their future studies and as future citizens and leaders.",

Next, lectures will focus on specific topics that bridge cultural psychology and basics concepts related to multiculturalism. Topics include: group and identity formation, stereotyping, prejudice, stigma, and intergroup contact. Finally, the course will end with an interrogation of multiculturalism and psychological approaches to the study of diversity.

Having gained some understanding of these concepts, students explore new technologies in areas such as brain computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, gene sequence analysis, renewable energy, virtual reality, and biotechnology.\n \n Participants explore virtual experiments so as to understand reflection and refraction, write code for object recognition, and work with MATLAB (a software used by scientists and engineers) to create simulated models. They gain insights into best research practices and learn to peer-review science articles. They also work in groups on projects that they present at the end of the course.\n \n For this course, augmented reality pioneer, Amir Baradaran is working with the instructor to develop an augmented reality application, My DigiLab, which will be accessible to students for the duration of the program. The platform is a multi-user pedagogical software, accessible through Android and iOS smartphones, that immerses students into a digitally created interactive scientific laboratory that simulates hands-on and real-time learning experiments. Students will learn by observing, interacting with, and manipulating virtual objects that are overlaid on top of their physical space. This educational gaming concept allows for students to engage with the existing online curriculum in strikingly different ways.",

This course will provide an overview of natural language processing as it is applied in a number of domains. The goal is to gain familiarity with a number of critical topics and techniques that use text as data, and then to see how those NLP techniques can be used to produce social science research and insights. This course will be hands-on, with several large-scale exercises. The course will start with an introduction to Python and associated key NLP packages and github. The course will then cover topics like language modeling; part of speech tagging; parsing; information extraction; tokenizing; topic modeling; machine translation; sentiment analysis; summarization; supervised machine learning; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites are basic probability and statistics, basic linear algebra and calculus. The course will use Python, and so if students have programmed in at least one software language, that will make it easier to keep up with the course.",

After that, there will be some discussion of data exploration, visualization in matplotlib, preprocessing, feature engineering, variable imputation, and feature selection. Supervised learning methods will be considered, including OLS models, linear models for classification, support vector machines, decision trees and random forests, and gradient boosting. Calibration, model evaluation and strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets, n on-negative matrix factorization, and outlier detection will be considered next. This will be followed by unsupervised techniques: PCA, discriminant analysis, manifold learning, clustering, mixture models, cluster evaluation. Lastly, we will consider neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image classification and recurrent neural networks. This course will primarily us Python.

This includes a look at the Prophet and the Qur'an and the ways in which both were actualized in the development of ritual, jurisprudence, theology, and sufism\/mysticism. The course then shifts to the modern period, examining the impact of colonization and the rise of liberal secularism on the Muslim world. The tension between traditional Sunni and Shi'i systems of authority and movements for 'modernization' and\/or 'reform' feature prominently in these readings. Topics range from intellectual attempts at societal\/religious reform (e.g. Islamic Revivalism, Modernism, Progressivism) and political re-interpretations of traditional Islamic motifs (e.g. Third-Worldism and Jihadist discourse) to efforts at accommodating scientific and technological innovations (e.g. evolution, bioethics ). The class ends by examining the efforts of American and European Muslim communities to carve out distinct spheres of identity in the larger global Muslim community ( umma) through expressions of popular culture (e.g. Hip-Hop).",

The course begins by placing the controversies surrounding the visual depiction of Muhammad in historical perspective (Gruber). This is followed by an examination of modern portrayals of Muslims in film that highlights both the vilification of the \u201cother\u201d (Shaheen) and the persistence of colonial discourses centered on the \u201cnative informant\u201d (Mamdani). Particular emphasis is given to recent pop cultural works that challenge these simplistic discourses of Islam. The second half of the course revisits Muhammad, employing an anthropological framework (Asad) to understand the controversies surrounding Salman Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses. The obsession with a gendered depiction of Islam is then examined through an anthropological framework that sheds light on the problems of salvation narratives (Abu Lughod).

    "course_descr":"As the line between humans and technology becomes increasingly blurred, the proliferation of social media platforms is transforming conceptions of identity, community, and citizenship. This course aims to build on the premise that technology changes not only what we do but also who we are. We draw upon established theories of identity formation, self-presentation, and impression management in order to map the intersection between new media technologies and the evolving processes by which identities are constructed, maintained, and represented. We consider how these developments are providing new opportunities for individual expression and collective empowerment, while at the same time contributing to a growing sense of fragmentation, polarization, and uncertainty.\n \n Central to this course is the understanding that self and identity are both the product of social interaction, and a force impacting the societies which help create them. Toward that end, through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, videos, short papers, group work, and oral presentations, students investigate the connections between social media and the following topics: 1) The development of the \u201ccommodified self\u201d and \u201cself-branding.\u201d 2) \u201cDigital surveillance\u201d and the \u201cmanaged self.\u201d 3). Expanding opportunities for the expression of historically \u201cmarginalized\u201d identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. 4). New avenues for the formation and mobilization of oppositional (or resistance) identities, including collective identification with political movements spanning the ideological spectrum from the far left to the far right.\n \n The central goal of this course is to provide students with a deeper appreciation for how digital technologies are fundamentally redefining traditional understandings of self and society, as well as to push participants to think more critically about their own place in what promises to an increasingly networked future.",

An intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. Prerequisite: SPAN UN 2101 or equivalent (as designated by the Department\u2019s Placement Examination). In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. *This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences \u2013including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics\u2014will be given registration priority. All Columbia students must take Spanish language courses (UN 1101-3300) for a letter grade.",

Both Galilean and special relativity are discussed, with an emphasis on the latter. Using algebra and space-time diagrams, students arrive at Lorentz transformations and explore their most significant consequences.\n \n Through examples, exercises, and problems, participants acquire an understanding of one of the most fundamental theories of modern physics. They discover how special relativity changes our conceptions of time and length measurements. We also examine the experimental basis for Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity and look at how general relativity helps us to understand concepts such as black holes, gravitational waves, and the evolution of the universe. In addition, students take part in developing a computer game simulating relativistic effects of high-speed intergalactic travel.\n \n In the process of exploring these challenging topics, course participants expand their capacity for creative problem solving and their ability to think critically and independently.",

While learning how to use the software, students are also introduced to several broad concepts in science and technology, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, signal processing, electrical circuit models, biological models, and mechanical models. Participants learn to apply these concepts by writing code and building models in MATLAB.  In the process of building those models, students learn how to legitimately carry on scientific inquiry. They apply this learning to create their own experimental paradigms in MATLAB. They formulate scientific questions and design hypotheses to test those questions. To test the hypotheses, they create experiments and collect the necessary data by building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with MATLAB. They further analyze data from the experiments using the MATLAB software and form conclusions regarding their scientific inquiry.  Students also visit science and engineering labs at Columbia University and are introduced to the process of journal publication.  \nParticipants are required to bring their own laptops, either Windows or Mac-based, for this course. Laptops should have at least 4Gb of RAM memory. Instructions on how to download and set up the software are emailed to students prior to the first class.",

An important goal of the class is to have students work in groups to apply economic concepts to current public policy issues having to do with urban environmental and earth systems. The use of the worlds water bodies and the atmosphere as economic inputs to production are also examined. The economics of renewable resources is described and sustainable economic development models are discussed and analyzed. Some time will also be devoted to international trade and regulation, and industrial organization issues. Students not only learn economic concepts, but they will also learn how to explain them to decision-makers. The instructor will tailor this course to the skill level of the students in order to most effectively suit the needs of the class.",

Classic works by influential TV creators are screened, read, and discussed. Various genres of TV are explored, from comedy to drama to sci-fi to unscripted (or \u201creality\u201d) television, but our primary focus will be on work within the single-camera drama and comedy genres.\n \n While learning about the \u201cTV greats,\u201d students launch into the creation of their own shows, working through a series of exercises individually and in groups, developing and honing their skills in writing and pitching. Since television continues to be primarily a writers\u2019 medium, we focus on character, story, tone, contemporary value, etc. We also cover the creative aspects of TV production, such as directing, camera, production design, costumes, and music.\n \n The final project is a short pilot or key scene that the students pitch then write and create in groups and shoot on their phones and with basic editing software.",

Indeed, the business impact of Blockchain technologies will likely be much larger than that which the internet itself has had because Blockchain will fundamentally change the power dynamic of data ownership. Blockchain is already impacting a variety of industries, and in this class we will look specifically at its analytical implications.",

Students have the opportunity to observe court proceedings; meet with judges, local law enforcement, and defense counsel; and hear from experts in the field.\n \n Participants learn to validate and analyze evidence while working in teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys to develop a trial strategy, argue to preclude evidence, and prepare witnesses for trial testimony.\n \n The course pays particular attention to the Federal Rules of Evidence (with distinctions made for New York state-specific rules) that govern the introduction of evidence at trial. The rules of conduct that govern the U.S. trial system are explored, as are the various strategies of trial practice.\n \n Students attend lectures and demonstrations and are afforded the opportunity to practice the skills learned through daily classroom exercises. Participants should be prepared to orally argue their positions and will be called upon to make presentations frequently. At the heart of the program are daily exercises, designed to hone students' trial skills, that are rooted in a hypothetical legal case.\n \n The course culminates with participants, divided into teams of prosecutors and defense attorneys, presenting their final cases before a jury.",

First, using the rich quantitative evidence and mapping tools in several data portals (both proprietary and open source) and the powerful data management tools in Excel, students will compile \u201cdata portraits\u201d of each neighborhood in the region.\u00a0 Then, using Excel, students will learn basic descriptive and inferential statistics and apply these methods to characterize neighborhoods along the diversity-inequality axes.\u00a0 In the course capstone project, they will combine their data analysis with their annotated visual impressions of each neighborhood into a digital portfolio which they will present to the class. By the end of the course students will have not only have deepened their understanding of the city (and perhaps their own neighborhoods), but will also have acquired an intermediate level proficiency in Excel, learned the rudiments of data management and descriptive and inferential statistics, and a variety of quantitative and qualitative social science approaches to urban studies.",

Trends such as the proliferation of armed conflict between states and transnational insurgent groups and the development of autonomous weapons systems and cyber-warfare capabilities have raised questions about the sufficiency of IHL to regulate warfare today. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of IHL, and central debates about its interpretation and implementation in 21st-Century armed conflict.\n \n In the first part of the course, students are introduced to the moral principles underpinning IHL. They then turn to surveying the texts of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in developing and ensuring respect for IHL.\n \n In the second part of the course, we examine major debates about IHL and its implementation today. Topics include the questions raised by the proliferation of transnational terrorism, multiparty civil wars, humanitarian intervention, drones, autonomous weapons systems, and cyber warfare.\n \n Course materials draw widely from political science, international law, psychology, philosophy, literature, and film. Class time is divided between lecture and discussion of the reading assignments, and film screenings, debates, group projects, and student presentations.",

The course\u2019s primary focus will be attending to sounds, words and images with an ear to themes of\u00a0 voice, power, presence, and representation. Students will develop a critical vocabulary and practice a variety of modes of hearing and analyzing the meanings and effects of popular music. By examining popular music in relation to intersections of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability, the body, class, politics, and activism, students will examine a wide repertory of music by using a variety of analytical \u201csieves,\u201d refining and enriching their musical experience as critically astute listeners and writers. The course weaves together close listening with some of the central writings on women musical artists, listening, and feminist theory through seminar-style discussion and written work.

    "course_descr":"From blues singers to girl groups, pop divas to hip-hop icons, women are central to the histories of popular music. The musical landscape of the past century would be unrecognizable without the contributions of women including Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, Dolly Parton, Celia Cruz, Queen Latifah, Lady Gaga, Lauryn Hill, Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki Minaj, and Cardi B. Women, Power, & Popular Music develops modes of feminist listening to a range of music, including the blues, spirituals, jazz, gospel, traditional music, pop, rock, R&B, soul, salsa, country, hip-hop, and crossover music. The course\u2019s primary focus will be attending to sounds, words and images with an ear to themes of\u00a0 voice, power, presence, and representation. Students will develop a critical vocabulary and practice a variety of modes of hearing and analyzing the meanings and effects of popular music. By examining popular music in relation to intersections of gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability, the body, class, politics, and activism, students will examine a wide repertory of music by using a variety of analytical \u201csieves,\u201d refining and enriching their musical experience as critically astute listeners and writers. The course weaves together close listening with some of the central writings on women musical artists, listening, and feminist theory through seminar-style discussion and written work. Students will develop skills in hearing popular music through critically aware ears and will reflect upon popular music and the discourse about it through close listening and viewing, discussion of assigned readings, recordings, and videos, and writing projects.",

Students will learn not just about events but often-overlooked people who shaped the course of this history - often heroically. Our study of historical sources will be supplemented by visits from influential and dynamic guest speakers in the arts and humanities. Students will have an opportunity to study our guests' work in advance and discuss it with them when they visit. This course is not restricted to students who identify as LGBTQ - this history is important for everyone, so allies are welcome and encouraged!",

Looking at the relationships between reproduction, law, science, and histories of reproductive rights and justice activism, we will explore a variety of literary works, films, journalism, public health studies, and policy\/legal texts, all of which differently narrate, debate, script, and theorize about reproduction. Questions we will explore include: what is reproductive justice, and how does it differ from reproductive rights and health? How have long histories of reproductive violence shaped the reproductive justice mission? How do these histories influence the development and distribution of medical\/technological\/pharmaceutical innovations? How has the reproductive justice mission taken shape in New York City in particular, and what does it look like today? Students will end the course by developing their own reproductive justice project.",

Many novice writers are simply relating an incident as opposed to creating a story. This course will show beginner and experienced writers how to mine their lives and imaginations for ideas and how to develop those ideas into children's stories-a step by step process from inspiration to finished manuscript for picture books, early readers, emerging readers and chapter books. Students will also learn the importance of reading their writing out loud-a process that helps both reader and listener develop a better ear for the story's pace, cadence and structure. Writing for children has become incredibly popular in the past fifteen years and publishing houses have been inundated with manuscripts. Many houses have ceased accepting unsolicited manuscripts all together. This course will disclose other avenues to getting your manuscript into the hands of agents and editors.",

Everywhere has been written about, so how do we find something fresh to say about\u2026 Paris, or even Patagonia? In this course, we both dispel, and prove, some of the myths of travel writing. Students learn to find an angle in order to uncover destinations anew and make them personal\u2014 it\u2019s in the personal that the universal is revealed. From crafting a compelling lede and understanding the need for a strong \u201cnut graph,\u201d to knowing the value of dialogue in propelling the story forward, and then finding the ideal kicker to send the reader away satisfied, students dissect published stories and are sent out into \u201cthe field\u201d (of New York City) to craft their own. Travel writing is more than, \u201cI went here, I did this, I ate that.\u201d From front-of-book and service pieces, to destination features, we discuss magazine and newspaper travel writing in depth, as well as touch on longer form travel writing. Finally, through exercises and assignments, students learn to craft a compelling pitch in order to approach editors.",

    "course_title":"WRITING THE YOUNG ADULT NOVEL",
    "course_descr":"Young adult fiction is a relatively new category in book publishing, but it is growing fast. The readers of YA books are between 12 and 18 years of age. However, its popularity can sometimes extend well beyond the intended age range; Harry Potter being the best-known example. The YA category spans a number of subgenres, including paranormal romance, dystopian sci-fi, and coming-of-age realism. The best YA novels feature fully realized characters and a level of emotional complexity that appeal to teens. And yet, YA books can include frightful displays of violence and can be unabashed about sex. They also feature swiftly moving plots combined with a young person's unique world view-pairings that are unlike anything found in traditional literary fiction. In this workshop, we will embark on writing our own YA novels. With our work always at the center of discussion we will explore the essence of what makes it YA in terms of narrative point of view and subject matter while also challenging the conventions of genre fiction. By way of example, we will look at the work of Sherman Alexie, Lois Lowry and Megan McCafferty. For examples of 'new adult' or 'crossover' fiction we will read excerpts from books such as those by Curtis Sittenfeld, J.D. Salinger, and others. Course work will include selected readings, but the emphasis of the workshop will be on writing and critiquing our own work. Students will write up to three chapters of an original YA or crossover novel along with a partial chapter outline for their book in progress. The class will also include visits from published YA authors who will speak about craft, audience, and getting published.",

The class will also break down stories, novels, and essays from a variety of authors-Bill Hicks' political satire; the darkly comedic fiction of Barry Hannah and Paul Beatty; the absurd humor of Tina Fey and Baratunde Thurston; Anthony Lane's charming British snarkiness; Spy Magazine's sharply parodic voice; Woody Allen's one-liners; Lena Dunham's zeitgeist comedy-in an effort to better understand what makes their humor work. Students will be asked to write stories inspired and influenced by these authors. As we critique each other's work, we will investigate strategies related to the craft of humor writing, including self-deprecation, political satire, humor and the other, going blue, dark comedy, schtick, humor as a means vs. humor as an end, crossing the line, and how to write funny without sacrificing substance.",

    "course_descr":"Do rats laugh? Do dogs pretend? Can birds use tools? While it has traditionally been assumed that animals are not capable of thoughts, emotions, or anything comparable to human intelligence, researchers working with animals from rats and bats to wolves and whales now have an impressive and growing body of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that strongly challenges those earlier suppositions.\n \n This course surveys the fascinating field of cognitive ethology\u2014the study of animal minds\u2014and explores questions of what animals think and feel, the complexity of their thought, and the depth of their emotions. Students examine cutting-edge research from fields such as cognitive neuroscience, psychology, endocrinology, and ethology that support the theoretical ideas first proposed by Darwin, who is often credited as the first scientist to seriously study the emotional lives of animals. Darwin\u2019s ideas were later advanced by Donald Griffen, the \u201cfather of cognitive ethology,\u201d whose big questions about animal consciousness laid the groundwork for the explosion of research we see today. What we are learning about animal sentience is transforming our understanding of non-human animals, creating impetus for new research into how they experience the world, each other, and possibly themselves.\n \n In this seminar-style class, students read and discuss the research of ethologists such as Marc Bekoff, Konrad Lorenz, James Gould, Jane Goodall, Franz De Waal, and E.O Wilson. These pioneering researchers fundamentally changed our understanding of the animal mind, shedding new light on the extraordinary and diverse abilities of our fellow species to learn, problem-solve, use tools, express emotions, and even mourn their dead. What\u2019s more, we are learning that animals communicate complex information in ways we could never have imagined.\n \n Virtual tours of the Wild Bird Fund and the Wolf Conservation Center in Westchester County offer participants an opportunity to observe animal behavior and speak to experts about their research. These experiences provide context for the material covered in class and give rise to important questions and rich, stimulating discussions. Students also have an opportunity to explore the broad array of academic and career paths that relate to cognitive ethology, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, conservation biology, psychology, philosophy and ethics, cognitive neuroscience, science writing, and animal law.\n \n Course requirement in",
