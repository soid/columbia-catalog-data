AFAS UN1001,INTRO TO AFRICAN-AMER STUDIES,"Prerequisites: Students need to register for a section of AFAS UN1010, the required discussion section for this course. From the arrival of enslaved Africans to the recent election of President Barack Obama, black people have been central to the story of the United States, and the Americas, more broadly. African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this “New World” democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African-American cultural and political life in the U.S. but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the “middle passage” to the present so-called “post-racial” moment—drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature—to grapple with key questions, concerns, and problems (i.e. agency, resistance, culture, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African-American history, culture, and politics. Students will be introduced to a range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e. migration, urbanization, globalization, etc.), significant cultural/political developments (i.e. uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, Pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc.), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e. Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, etc.).

AFEN GU4000,Water Worlds in Literary Imagination,"This interdisciplinary course surveys literary, cinematic, historical and other archival text representations of time and change in and around waterways in the Global South—oceanic, riverine, at the littoral and in hinterlands. It is animated by questions of how people live with water as horizon, resource, life-giving source, as ancestral boundaries and threat. We do so now in a time when climate change refocuses our dependencies upon, and vulnerabilities to, water.
  
Our themes are shaped by water’s influence on the rhythms of lives, and how these rhythms have been changed and are changing—deliberately, as in dam building and its aftermaths in lives, and through climate change.",Yvette Christianse,2:10pm,4:00pm,00771,,W4000-20253-001,Water,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFEN,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Christians%C3%AB,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFEN/W4000-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20253AFEN4000W001,SEMINAR

AFRS BC3010,Black Fashion and Dress Cultures,"This class is a cultural history of Black fashion and dress through the lens of the current Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute’s exhibition 
Superfine: Tailoring Black Style
. 
Superfine 
presents a cultural and historical examination of Black dandyism, from Enlightenment England to contemporary incarnations in the cosmopolitan art and fashion worlds of Paris, London, and New York.
  
 
  
Historical manifestations of dandyism range from absolute precision in dress and tailoring to flamboyance and fabulousness in self-presentation. The 
Superfine
 exhibition uses dandyism to chronicle the ways in which Black people have used dress and fashion to transform the identities they were given and to propose new ways of embodying political and social possibilities. Interpreting Black dandyism as both an aesthetics and a politics, this class emphasizes the importance of sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora.",Monica L Miller,10:10am,12:00pm,00220,,X3010-20253-001,Black Fashion and Dress C,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFRS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFRS/X3010-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253AFRS3010X001,SEMINAR
AFRS BC3021,Queer Caribbean Critique,"This seminar analyzes the different critical approaches to studying same-sex desire in the Caribbean region. The region’s long history of indigenous genocide, colonialism, imperialism, and neo-liberalism, have made questions about “indigenous” and properly “local” forms of sexuality more complicated than in many other regions. In response, critics have worked to recover and account for local forms of same-sex sexuality and articulated their differences in critical and theoretical terms outside the language of “coming out” and LGBT identity politics. On the other hand, critics have emphasized how outside forces of colonialism, imperialism, and the globalization of LGBT politics have impacted and reshaped Caribbean same-sex desires and subjectivities. This course studies these various critical tendencies in the different contexts of the Anglophone, Francophone, Hispanophone, and Dutch Caribbean.",Maja Horn,10:10am,12:00pm,00115,,X3021-20253-001,QUEER CARIBBEAN CRITIQUE,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFRS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFRS/X3021-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253AFRS3021X001,SEMINAR

AFRS BC3160,Fanon   s Psychology of the Oppressed,"Frantz Fanon’s ideas have been influential for decades among theorists, practitioners, and activists alike.  This seminar is focused on understanding Fanon’s particular perspective on the psychology of the oppressed and its relevance for examining the experience of past and present racialized inequality and its effects in society. The course is divided into four sections, which build cumulatively.
  
I). An introductory section introduces Fanon’s central ideas (e.g., dialecticism, existentialism, post-colonialism) in their intellectual and socio-historical context (e.g., the Algerian revolution, African decolonization, South African Apartheid, the US civil rights and women’s rights movements).
  
II). A second section locates Fanon in psychological theory and therapeutic theory and practice.  The cultural and political (Eurocentric?) roots of psychological theory and practice are examined as are notions of oppression causing psychological and physical violence as well as psychopathology / psychological disorder.
  
III). A third section examines Fanon and others psychological approaches to identity with particular attention to the presumed “inferiority complex” of oppressed peoples, nationalist and other reconstructions of identity in opposition to oppression, sociological psychological conceptualizations of stigma, and Dubois’s influential ideas regarding double consciousness.
  
IV). A fourth and final section focuses on resistance and rebellion.  The focus here is on the psycho-moral implications of (violent, peaceful, non-disruptive) action against oppression with reference to the distinct perspectives of Fanon in comparison to influential figures like Gandhi and M.L.K Jr.  These issues are linked to a post-Fanon approach to the psychology of the oppressed called Liberation Psychology.",Colin Leach,2:10pm,4:00pm,00166,,X3160-20253-001,Psychology of the Oppress,Africana Studies (AFSB),AFRS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AFRS/X3160-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253AFRS3160X001,SEMINAR
AFRS BC3516,Environmental Humanities in the Global S,"""This interdisciplinary course studies how individuals and communities in the Global South attempt to make sense of the ‘sense of an ending’ that underlines all warnings about environmental crisis and climate change. Our interdisciplinary course has a doubled foundation out of which our readings and discussions will grow: communal understanding and knowledge about local environments, on one hand, and the relation between such knowledge and the data and information gathered by scientists.""
 
 ""We therefore begin with a simple question: what is the relation between the Humanities and the work of scientists? Scientists undertake painstaking, necessary research to provide communities and their governments with vital, necessary information. Individuals and communities interpret and translate this information, often affectively. An organization of scientists studying carbon levels across Africa can list the progressive increase in temperatures across Africa over a period of years and calculate anticipated increases. An image based on this data may visualize the projected rise:""
 
 ""A glance reveals something dire based on the way we associate red with danger. Our course is oriented towards who lives beneath the surfaces of data and images that ‘draw a picture’ for us. We read for how communities and individuals explain and communicate their relation to the historical and changing environments. In other words, we attend to narration, in different forms—fiction, poetry, song, travelogue—to grasp how experiences are rendered comprehensible. There is a broad ‘where’ as well, and a fluid ‘when.’ ‘Where’ takes us into the portmanteau category of ‘The Global South.’ We bracket the scope of this category to focus upon specific places in the Indian Ocean, sub-Saharan Africa and diasporic African communities. ‘When’ permits us to think of time, the time of the world, the times of change and the times of aftermaths. Go into an archive, open a history book, a sacred text and you will encounter ‘endings.’ We enter British colonial archives to see how signs of  ‘When’ also allows us to face an underlying dread that might be called a ‘sense of an ending’ and to see just how many such ‘endings’ have come to pass.

AHIS BC2017,Cell Phone Photography: Exploring Digita,"Today’s cell phones are equipped with cameras that far surpass those used by the pioneers of digital photography, offering superior resolution and multi-sensor capabilities that revolutionize how we capture and process images. This course explores the creative and technical potential of smartphone photography, focusing on accessible tools and workflows that empower students to produce compelling digital works. The curriculum emphasizes post-production and digital media techniques over traditional camera mastery. Students will develop foundational skills in Adobe Suite applications, including Lightroom and Photoshop for photo editing and After Effects and Premiere for video production. We will also discuss the integration of artificial intelligence in modern photography, examining how AI enhances editing processes and opens new creative possibilities. A significant part of the course will address fundamental questions of light in photography, the use of RAW formats—offered by many smartphones but seldom understood—and the structure of digital image files. Students will also learn about post-production techniques for preparing images for print, as well as for projection or display on digital screens, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end digital photography workflow. Thinking Locally: Street photography serves as a central theme in this course, encouraging students to document the vibrant life of New York City through weekly assignments. A guided photo walk in Harlem will provide hands-on experience in capturing unique, candid moments. Ethical considerations will be a key focus, addressing topics like consent, privacy, and best practices for interacting with subjects.

We'll start with an in-depth study of the life and work of Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986), whose art has a unique sense of time, driven by the unknown, the immaterial, and the spiritual.
  
This class is for artists who want to construct their own sense of time, punctuation, and duration, as well as those looking to discover the visual and audio aesthetics of their generation. How does a feeling become an image, and what sound does it make? What are our media aesthetics and skins? Is there a way to address the optical beyond the eye and engage what we currently consider secondary senses, take our bodies back? Our collective task is to construct a camera (both a room and an apparatus) that captures both aural and visual images, creating a sonorous space where we can encounter ourselves in our own time.

AHIS BC3428,The Making of Global Contemporary Art:,"This lecture class introduces the notion of global contemporary art through the history of exhibitions, chiefly biennials and other large-scale endeavors, and principal agents behind them. On the one hand, the course considers exhibitions as a crucial tool of cultural diplomacy, which seek to position and/or reposition cities, regions, and even entire nations or “peoples” on the international scene. Thus, we will explore how the artistic interests vested in exhibition-making intersect with other—political, economic, ideological, and cultural—interests. We will consider those intersections paying special attention to the shifts in political relations and tensions during and after the Cold War, including the moment of decolonization in Africa; the moment commonly understood as “globalization” and associated with the expansion of the neoliberal capitalism after 1989; and, finally, the current moment of the planetary crisis. This expansive view of the “global contemporary art” will allow us to distinguish different impetuses behind internationalism and globalism that not only seek to establish hegemony, artistic or otherwise, but also look for the means to forge transnational dialogues and solidarities. On the other hand, this class seeks to illuminate how certain artistic idioms and approaches developed after World War II achieved primacy that influences artistic production to this day. To this end, we will examine the rise of a “visionary curator” as a theorist and tastemaker. We will also explore how more recent exhibitions have sought to expand the geography of the “canonized” post-WWII art movements and valorize artistic production conceived outside of the so-called “West.”
  
In addition to weekly brief writing assignments (150–300 words each), both in and outside of class, the students in the course will reconceive the installation of one of MoMA’s permanent collection galleries (1940s-70s or 1970s-present) and produce a podcast that provides the rationale for the reinstallation in form of dialogue.",,11:40am,12:55pm,00091,,X3428-20253-001,Making of Global Contemp,Art History @Barnard,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/X3428-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,TR,20253AHIS3428X001,LECTURE

In a world, soon impossible to physically inhabit, the things we consume now consume us. The stakes have never been higher. To make a new world, we must use design.
  
Our planet need not be disposed. It is an infrastructure for another one. To make contact with it we need to understand design as a value system for propelling possibility, not possession. The designed world requires new relation to things and fullness of use. As we read, write, experience and make our own projects,

AHIS GR6413,The Real Picasso,"Picasso’s work is the great kaleidoscope through which 20th-century art passes: from its beginnings in Cubism through which the world is given as though through cut crystal; to the commercial forms of collage; to the presage of surrealist anguish; and, finally, to an untoward neo-classicism. The result of this restless exploration is the invention of multiple formal languages, which need to be deciphered in spite of the perverse literature on the subject which insists on transposing this into the art-historical language of iconography. The literature is rich with the analytic struggles between the great Picasso scholars: William Rubin, Leo Steinberg, and Picasso’s biographer, John Russel. The skirmishes over the “iconography” of cubism extends to the interpretation of the work’s relation to “primitivism.” This controversy has given rise to yet a new vector on Picasso’s work: structuralism and semiotics.",Rosalind Krauss,2:10pm,4:00pm,12365,,G6413-20253-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_E._Krauss,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G6413-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

AHIS GR8041,"AI, Imaging, Art","This graduate seminar will interrogate intersections in artificial intelligence, machine vision, neural networks, visual culture, imaging, and art. Students will gain a foundation in the histories and technologies underlying the recent rise of neural networks and machine vision, as well as the more recent rise of generative AI, especially image generation. With this foundation, we will investigate a range of artistic, technological, mass-media, and legal developments in visual culture and AI. In addition to readings and seminar meetings, we will take advantage of the ample public and private AI-related programming at Columbia and in New York: lectures, exhibitions, screenings, studio visits with artists, etc. Students will also have the opportunity to work with custom generative AI models.
  
Admission by application only. Priority will be given to PhD students with backgrounds in art history, visual culture, and/or computer and data science. All students are expected to complete the readings and tutorials for the first class prior to the start of the semester.",Noam M Elcott,10:10am,12:00pm,13905,,G8041-20253-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8041-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

AHIS GR8477,Approaches to American Material Culture,"How shall we approach the vast collection of artifacts left by Americans in the eighteenth through twentieth centuries?  What can silver tea services, Amish quilts, rubber telephone receivers or ebony Art Deco coffee tables tell us about the people who designed, produced and used them?  How can we understand the sourcing and transformation of raw materials as culturally embedded practices that reinforce, contest or evolve power dynamics between members of different human communities? What role have everyday objects played in mediating Americans’ relationships to the natural world?  How can the study of material culture deepen our understanding of U.S. entanglements with global history?
  
In this graduate seminar we will explore the methods used by art historians and others to explore the meanings of material culture.  The class will involve several visits to local collections and each student is expected to produce an 18-20 page research paper on a single object or class of objects.",Elizabeth Hutchinson,2:10pm,4:00pm,13933,,G8477-20253-001,American Material Culture,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8477-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

AHIS GR8492,THE PERFORMATIVE OBJECT,"The 1960’s and ‘70s witnessed an explosion of performance works in the visual arts. Departing from precedents in the early 20th century, performance during this period is marked both by its international reach and breadth of artistic experimentation: process painting, extreme bodily acts, textual scores, video and audio recordings, sculptural installations, ritualistic drawings, and direct political interventions, proposing complex relations between object, process, and act. This course explores this history and its legacy through the lens of two contributing factors: first are political events, upheavals and revolutionary movements that erupted across the globe, generating artistic performance as protest and activism; and second is an emergent media culture characterized by technologies of repetition and recording, resulting in performance works that are defined through reproduction rather than liveness, while taking inspiration from experimental film, music, and dance. To explore these themes, the class will examine select case studies of individual artists, movements and collectives: among which include the NY based Guerilla Art Action Group; Japanese Gutai and international Happenings; Brazilian neo-Concretism; South Korean Experimental art (
silheom misul
); as well as video, audio, photographic and durational works (by Ana Mendieta, Bruce Nauman, Adrian Piper, Tehching Hsieh, etc.), to name a few. In final research papers, students will trace this genealogy, examining contemporary performance works that are realized variously through networked and digital forms, uncapturable ephemerality, or direct social action.",Janet L Kraynak,12:10pm,2:00pm,12367,,G8492-20253-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8492-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20253AHIS8492G001,SEMINAR

AHIS GR8643,Painting in Sixteenth-Century Japan,"Japan’s brief Momoyama period (1573-1615) is often characterized as an “age of gold,” an era in which politically powerful warlords commissioned lavish works of art. During the 150 years between the Ōnin War and establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in the early 17th century, a series of military rulers unified the warring Japanese states, and for the first time in Japan’s history engaged briefly with the world beyond China through contact with European missionaries and merchants. The same warlords participated in every sphere of cultural life, sponsoring the construction of lavish fortresses and temples, contributing to the development of the arts of Tea and Noh drama, and encouraging the importation of printed books from China and Korea. This course will explore the art of painting in the Japan’s “era of unification.” We will concentrate on the gilded screens and panel paintings that temples, castles, and palaces, but will also study fan paintings, portraiture, and genre painting in order to comprehend the profound impact that this pivotal era would have on all succeeding periods of Japanese art.",Matthew P McKelway,4:10pm,6:00pm,12370,,G8643-20253-001,PAINTING IN 16TH CENTURY,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8643-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20253AHIS8643G001,SEMINAR
AHIS GR8812,Cities of Knowledge: Orientalizing Manha,"In this course, graduate students from different disciplines will explore the ‘Orient’ in Manhattan. The course involves the active search for and analysis of Manhattan's urban space to survey its ‘Oriental’ buildings, monuments, parks, public inscriptions, and even ephemeral, everyday spaces that carry the sense of the ‘Orient’ to the city. Cities are physical places, yet, they are also assemblages of different layers of time, and geographies. These layers are designed to create communal identities and evoke recollections of past memories. Focus will be put on the written history of these spaces by searching in archives (in the City of New York) and digging out written and oral information about the histories of the formation of these spaces and their interactions with their surroundings.
  
The course will cover many monuments, like the famous obelisk in Central Park or the lessknown Jordanian column in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens; public buildings like Central Synagogue on Lexington, the Islamic Cultural Center on Upper East Side Mosque, or Olana State Historic Site in Hudson, NY; but also, the inner decorations of restaurants, bars (the Carlyle Bar) and even oriental Halal shops, as well as ephemeral spaces like international fairs, and Cairene grill boots.
  
Traditionally, Islamic art and Islamic architecture have been studied separately within art history and architecture history disciplines. The purpose of this course is, in the first place, to bridge the gap between the two disciplines while working across theories of visual culture and critically revisiting urban studies. A further aspect evolves the discourse about architectural ornament as part of the entire approach to ornament as an ‘Oriental’ trope. Thus, canonical discussions about Orientalism will form part of the course’s readings and will contribute to understanding how the architectural ornament of Manhattan forms identities. The course will introduce and discuss theoretical issues concerning urban architecture and ‘Orientalism’ and the making of the image of ‘Others’ in NYC public spaces. It will also provide a historical survey of these spaces and aim to create a novel comprehensive map for ‘Orientalized’ New York.",,2:10pm,4:00pm,12371,,G8812-20253-001,'Orientalizing' Manhattan,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/G8812-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20253AHIS8812G001,SEMINAR

We discuss too how temples, monasteries, tombs, and shrines supported the pursuit of pleasure, amusement, sociability, and other worldly interests. We also explore the symbiotic relationship between Indic religions and kingship, and the complex ways in which politics and court culture shaped sacred environments.

In all of Deleuze's work there is a search for a new 'image of thought.' But how did art figure in this search, and how did the search in turn appeal to artists, writers, filmmakers, architects, as well as curators or critics? In this seminar, we explore the complex theme of 'thinkin in art' in Deleuze, and its implications for art in the 21st century or for the global contemporary art of today.",John Rajchman,2:10pm,4:00pm,12355,,W4546-20253-001,GILLES DELEUZE:THINKING I,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rajchman,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W4546-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

Since the beginning of China’s dynastic history around the first millennium BCE, people from surrounding regions and even further afield have consistently moved into the Chinese heartland. These groups include not only nomads from the Mongolian steppes and the Tibetan Plateau, but also merchants, missionaries, and Muslims arriving via the so-called “Silk Roads”—a network of land and sea routes connecting China to the rest of the Eurasian continent (India, Persia, Central Asia, etc.). In certain periods, descendants of the Chinese diaspora and refugees in frontier regions also played significant roles in Chinese history. This seminar focuses on the archaeological remains and artistic expressions of these immigrants, as well as their interactions with native Chinese art and culture. Topics covered range from painting, sculpture, and calligraphy to crafts and architecture.",Jin Xu,4:10pm,6:00pm,12357,,W4762-20253-001,ArtOf Immigrants in China,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W4762-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

In the first weeks, important concepts of medieval society and its architecture will be presented in combination with a number of new technologies recently adopted in the field.

Nonetheless, academic prescriptions and expectations endured in diluted or fragmentary form. We will examine the transformations of this once privileged category and look at how the representation of exemplary deeds and action becomes increasingly problematic in the context of social modernization and the many global challenges to Eurocentrism. Selected topics explore how image making was shaped by new models of historical and geological time, by the invention of national traditions, and by the emergence of new publics and visual technologies.

AHIS UN3017,Architecture and Deception,"Fittingly in the age of fake news, this seminar addresses how lying, deception, concealment, and forgery have shaped the history of architecture and its historiography. It deals not only with architects’ lies, but also with how their architecture can be deceptive in many different ways. It also analyses how architectural narratives—including biographies—and historical accounts have been shaped by falsehoods and distortions.
  
While addressing philosophical issues that remain relevant to our present, the course will examine some of the most influential architects and key works of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth century—a pivotal time within intellectual history for the definition of the concept of ‘truth’ and also, therefore, of its opposite. 
  
Students will learn how to make use of the many lenses through which architecture can be investigated. The goal is not only to acquire a foundation in European architectural history, but also, more broadly, to develop the skills necessary to analyze architecture and to deal with original architectural objects and texts, as well as to cultivate a critical attitude towards architectural literature.",Eleonora Pistis,12:10pm,2:00pm,12340,,W3017-20253-001,Architecture and Deceptio,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3017-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

AHIS UN3317,Shaping Renaissance Rome,"This year the eyes of the Catholic world will once again turn to Rome as the city celebrates the Jubilee—a tradition that has occurred every twenty-five years since the fifteenth century. In this seminar, we will investigate the architectural and urban history of Rome, stressing projects (both realized and ideal) conceived during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The city will be analyzed as the product of successive interventions that have created a deeply layered topography. How Rome has continued to build upon its past, both literally through physical reuse and figuratively through symbolic appropriation, from the time of Pope Martin V to Pope Sixtus V, will thus serve as a key theme. Working within this overarching framework, each class session focuses on a thematic group of projects that will be studied in relationship to one another rather than as independent monuments. We will examine churches, palaces, villas, public amenities, streets, and piazzas through the functional demands that shaped them and the life that went on in and around them. Topics under discussion include architectural and urban palimpsest; the resurgence of interest in antiquity; building typologies; self-aggrandizement by means of architectural patronage; the reverberations of the Counter-Reformation in architecture; the role of urban rituals and spectacles; and the representation of the city and its buildings in drawings, maps, and prints.",Michael J Waters,2:10pm,4:00pm,12343,,W3317-20253-001,,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3317-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

AHIS UN3466,AIDS Is Contemporary,"This seminar examines two intertwined propositions. One is the undisputable fact that the global HIV/AIDS pandemic is ongoing and that the disease continues to shape the way artists and activists grapple with public health, national policy, and medical injustice.  The other is my own polemic-in-formation, which is that the eruption of AIDS in the 1980s was 
the 
threshold event that inaugurated what is now understood to be “the contemporary” within the art world.  Rather than periodize the start of “the contemporary” with the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, as has become conventional, we will investigate how the AIDS crisis precipitated a sudden urgency that more decisively marks this transition, in particular around the promiscuous inclusion of non-fine art forms such as demonstration posters, zines, and handmade quilts.  We will read foundational texts on HIV/AIDS organizing and look at interventions with graphic design, wheat-pasting, ashes action protests, body maps, embroidery, performance-based die-ins, voguing, film/video, and photography.
  
We will consider: the inextricability of queer grief, anger, love, and loss; lesbian care; the trap of visibility; spirituality and death; activist exhaustion; the role played by artists of color within ACT-UP; and dis/affinities across the US, Latin America, and South Africa. Our investigations will be bookended by two critical exhibitions, 
Witness: Against Our Vanishing
 (Artists Space, 1989) and

AHIS UN3613,Temples of Kyoto,"Perhaps no other single institution has played a more crucial role in the development and preservation of Japanese art and other forms of visual culture than the Buddhist temple, itself an entity that has undergone significant change, particularly in the modern period. This seminar will examine Buddhist temples in the city of Kyoto, Japan’s imperial capital from 794-1867 from their beginnings in the late eighth century into the early modern period. Although painting, sculpture, and architecture will be our primary focus, the course will provide students with multiple, interdisciplinary perspectives on the diverse forms of institutional organization, architecture, art, and liturgy that comprise Buddhist houses of worship, with particular attention to their development in the city of Kyoto. We will take a site-specific approach, attending to the following general issues: the legacy of continental practices in such early monasteries as Hōryūji and Tōdaiji in Nara; adaptations to Japanese urban space and landscape at Tōji and Enryakuji; physical changes in temples with the introduction of new sects such as Zen and Pure Land Buddhism; and the transformation of temples in the early modern period. Coinciding with the course will be a series of five guest lectures in February and March on the topic of medieval Japanese sculpture.",Matthew P McKelway,4:10pm,6:00pm,12349,,W3613-20253-001,TEMPLES OF KYOTO,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3613-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

AHIS UN3623,The Wall Paintings of China,"This seminar introduces the murals and screen paintings of pre-modern China, both functioned as “painted walls.” Besides examining the visual attributes of these wall paintings, it attends to their special materiality and spatiality rooted in their media—the wall and the screen—to explore their original functions and interactions with the audience. Special attention will be given to the wall paintings’ themes, motifs, spatial representations, styles, scale, media, placement, contexts of display, and audience. Students will take turns leading seminar discussions to analyze the readings for each week. Every week students will read the assigned essays and write a one or two page, double-space reflection on the content and argument. You will post your reflection with questions on Canvas the night before the seminar.",Yi-Bang Li,4:10pm,6:00pm,13525,,W3623-20253-001,Wall Paintings of China,Art History and Archaeology,AHIS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AHIS/W3623-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

Their proposals contributed to the Third World Liberation Front strike at San Francisco State University, the longest student strike in US history. Drawing inspiration from Gary Okihiro, founding director of Columbia’s Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race, this course takes student activists’ proposals for Third World Studies seriously.

Most of the reading will be by Native authors. In order to provide a firm historical foundation for understanding the dynamics of Indigenous and colonial history our emphasis will be on the period between European settlement and the nineteenth century. Coverage will not be exhaustive; there are too many Native nations in this region for that to be possible. Our focus rather will be on major turning points in Native history which have become flashpoints for controversy among scholars and in the broader public sphere: the relationship between Native nations and Pilgrims, King Philip’s War, the so-called Indian Great Awakening, and others. The course will cover topics in literary and religious history, politics, law, and anthropology, and should appeal to students in any of those fields, while providing an introduction to the history and methods of Indigenous Studies.",Ryan Carr,4:10pm,6:00pm,12897,,W3935-20253-001,,American Studies,AMST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AMST/W3935-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20253AMST3935W001,SEMINAR
AMST UN3941,"Democracy and De-Democratization, Theory","The concepts of democratic backsliding, regime cycles (between oligarchy and populism, democracy and dictatorship), hybrid regimes and reverse waves, were devised with regard to newly democratized and/or insufficiently institutionalized democratic regimes. Yet today even long consolidated, wealthy western democracies seem to be at risk. This course will focus on the case of the United States.  While domestic and external threats to American constitutional democracy are not new, there is widespread concern today that both liberal constitutionalism and American democracy are at grave risk.  Our inquiry will involve an in-depth study of the political theory and American politics literature on the relevant concepts and dynamics. In the first part of the course, we will discuss the basic concepts and theories regarding democracy, oligarchy, constitutionalism and regime cycles developed in classical and early modern political thought.  The second part of the course will focus on the U.S., the oldest constitutional representative democracy and typically deemed the exemplar of a successfully consolidated democratic regime.  We analyze the processes, dynamics, reversals and limits to democratization in the US focusing on key tipping points from the founding to the present.  Our focus will be on four sets of factors and modes of explanation for the relevant shifts: constitutional, political, socio-cultural, and economic.  We conclude with analysis of the  contemporary conjuncture and current threats to American constitutional democracy.",Jean L Cohen,2:10pm,4:00pm,13524,,W3941-20253-001,Democracy & De-Democratiz,American Studies,AMST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_L._Cohen,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/AMST/W3941-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253AMST3941W001,SEMINAR

ANHS GU4001,THE ANCIENT EMPIRES,"The principal goal of this course is to examine the nature and histories of a range of early empires in a comparative context. In the process, we will examine influential theories that have been proposed to account for the emergence and trajectories of those empires. Among the theories are the core-periphery, world-systems, territorial-hegemonic, tributary-capitalist, network, and IEMP approaches. Five regions of the world have been chosen, from the many that could provide candidates: Rome (the classic empire), New Kingdom Egypt, Qin China, Aztec Mesoamerica, and Inka South America. These empires have been chosen because they represent a cross-section of polities ranging from relatively simple and early expansionist societies to the grand empires of the Classical World, and the most powerful states of the indigenous Americas. There are no prerequisites for this course, although students who have no background in Anthropology, Archaeology, History, or Classics may find the course material somewhat more challenging than students with some knowledge of the study of early societies.

ANTH BC2012,LAB METHODS ARCHAEOLOGY,"Only the most recent chapters of the past are able to be studied using traditional historiographical methods focused on archives of textual documents. How, then, are we to analyze the deep history of human experiences prior to the written word? And even when textual archives do survive from a given historical period, these archives are typically biased toward the perspectives of those in power. How, then, are we to undertake analyses of the past that take into account the lives and experiences of all of society’s members, including the poor, the working class, the colonized, and others whose voices appear far less frequently in historical documents? From its disciplinary origins in nineteenth century antiquarianism, archaeology has grown to become a rigorous science of the past, dedicated to the exploration of long-term and inclusive social histories.
  
“Laboratory Methods in Archaeology” is an intensive introduction to the analysis of archaeological artifacts and samples in which we explore how the organic and inorganic remains from archaeological sites can be used to build rigorous claims about the human past. The 2022 iteration of the course centers on assemblages from two sites, both excavated by Barnard’s archaeological field program in the Taos region of northern New Mexico: (1) the Spanish colonial site of San Antonio del Embudo founded in 1725 and (2) the hippie commune known as New Buffalo, founded in 1967. Participants in ANTH BC2012 will be introduced to the history, geology, and ecology of the Taos region, as well as to the excavation histories of the two sites. Specialized laboratory modules focus on the analysis of chipped stone artifacts ceramics, animal bone, glass, and industrial artifacts.
  
The course only demands participation in the seminars and laboratory modules and successful completion of the written assignments, but all students are encouraged to develop specialized research projects to be subsequently expanded into either (1) a senior thesis project or (2) a conference presentation at the Society for American Archaeology, Society for Historical Archaeology, or Theoretical Archaeology Group meeting.",Severin Fowles,4:10pm,6:00pm,00778,,X2012-20253-001,,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/X2012-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,ANTH BC2012,T,20253ANTH2012X001,LECTURE

ANTH GR5115,Political Human-Animal Studies,"In a number of academic disciplines the concern with relationships between humans and non-humans has recently resulted in a radical revision of the ways in which we think people and animals construct their social worlds. This course addresses how humans and animals enter into, and interact within, each other's worlds. It draws upon perspectives from anthropology, geography, (political) philosophy, ethics, literary theory, and the sciences, placing current debates within the context of the deep history of human-animal relations. Topics to be discussed include ""wildness"", domestication, classification, animal rights, biotechnology, ""nature/culture"", food/cooking, fabulous/mythical animals, the portrayal of animals in popular culture, and human-animal sexualities.",Brian Boyd,10:10am,12:00pm,10337,,G5115-20253-001,Political Human-Animal St,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G5115-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ANTH GR5361,ETHICAL ISSUES IN MUSEUMS,"Ethical questions about museum activities are legion, yet they are usually only discussed when they become headlines in newspapers. At the same time, people working in museums make decisions with ethical and legal issues regularly and seldom give these judgments even little thought. In part, this is due to the fact that many of these decisions are based upon values that become second nature. This course will explore ethical issues that arise in all areas of a museum's operations from governance and management to collections acquisition, conservation, and deaccessioning. We will examine the issues that arise when the ownership of objects in a museum's are questioned; the ethical considerations involved in retention, restitution and repatriation; and what decolonization means for museums.",Sally Yerkovich,2:10pm,4:00pm,10235,,G5361-20253-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G5361-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,F,20253ANTH5361G001,SEMINAR
ANTH GR6051,"VALUE, OBJECTS, AND MEANING","This course explores how anthropologists have engaged with the question of value as means of understanding and comparing human social engagement with the creation, circulation, and consumption of objects and ideas. In doing so, this course will read classical anthropological texts concerned with exchange, social meaning and action and consider a variety of topics of anthropological interest such as gifts, commodities, capitalism, inequality, and the relationships between humans and nonhumans of many kinds. The course traces how questions and arguments that emerged out of earlier debates in “economic” anthropology were taken up and altered in later conversations about the analytical importance and utility of material and semiotic approaches. In doing so, the course explores what these genealogies might say about the possibility of, and the potential usefulness or desirability of, a contemporary or future-looking anthropology of value.",Hannah Chazin,10:10am,12:00pm,10048,,G6051-20253-001,VALUE OBJECTS AND  MEANING,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G6051-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,R,20253ANTH6051G001,SEMINAR

We will likewise address vicarious forms of personhood through the prosthetic, the avatar or the heteronomous. But we will also look into forms of dissipation and/or enhancement of personhood through bodybuilding, guinea-piging and pharmo-toxicities. As a whole, the course will bring to light how the question of personhood cross-culturally relates to language, performativity, religion, technology, law, gender, race, class, care, life and death.",Maria Jose de Abreu,2:10pm,4:00pm,10147,,G6245-20253-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/G6245-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,M,20253ANTH6245G001,SEMINAR
ANTH GR6294,POLITICAL CONCEPTS IN WAKE OF GEONTONTOP,"It’s hot and it’s getting hotter. As the machinery of capital extraction, industrialism, and consumption refuses to relinquish its grip, meteorological temperatures continue to rise and chemical hot zones spread. Tipping points threaten regime shifts in which the qualitative nature of the earth’s biosphere will alter. But until then, and even after then, hot zones occur in the aggregate only in abstraction. In reality they form like weather clouds over specific places—toxic smog over Beijing, lead poisoning in drinking water in Flint, Michigan, uranium exposure in Navajo and Hopi lands. Marx thought the social dialectic was leading to the purification of the fundamental opposition of human classes. No little evidence can be mustered to support the claim that we are nearing this moment—the world seems to be splitting into ever more extreme halves—the one percent and the ever-increasing precariate. But what many believe we are witnessing a new form of antagonism and which demands new modes of solidarity. The new swelter seems to them less fundamentally a war of class—although also a class war, although definitely not a clash of civilization—and more a clash of existents. And in this new war of the world everyone must decide with whom (or what) we are making ties of solidarity.

We come last to Foucault and affiliated theorists as successors both to French structuralism and to German social theory and its concerns with modernity, rationality, and power.

ANTH UN2004,INTRO TO SOC & CULTURAL THEORY,"This course presents students with crucial theories of society, paying particular attention at the outset to classic social theory of the early 20th century. It traces a trajectory of writings essential for an understanding of the social: from Saussure, Durkheim, Mauss, Weber, and Marx, on to the structuralist ethnographic elaboration of Claude Levi-Strauss and the historiographic reflections on modernity of Michel Foucault. We revisit periodically, reflections by Franz Boas, founder of anthropology in the United States (and of Anthropology at Columbia), for a sense of origins, an early anthropological critique of racism and cultural chauvinism, and a prescient denunciation of fascism.  We turn as well, also with ever-renewed interest in these times, to the expansive critical thought of W. E. B. Du Bois.  We conclude with Kathleen Stewart’s

ANTH UN2017,Mafias and Other Dangerous Affiliations,"Regimes of various shapes and sizes tend to criminalize associations, organizations, and social relations that these ruling powers see as anathema to the social order on which their power depends: witches, officers of toppled political orders, alleged conspirators (rebels, traitors, terrorists, and dissidents), gangsters and mafiosi, or corrupt officers and magnates. Our main goal will be to understand how and under what conditions do those with the power to do so define, investigate, criminalize and prosecute those kinds of social relations that are cast as enemies of public order. We will also pay close attention to questions of knowledge – legal, investigative, political, journalistic, and public – how doubt, certainty, suspicion and surprise shape the struggle over the relationship between the state and society.
  
The main part of the course is organized around six criminal investigations on mafia-related affairs that took place from the 1950s to the present (two are undergoing appeal these days) in western Sicily. After the introductory section, we will spend two weeks (four meetings) on every one of these cases. We will follow attempts to understand the Mafia and similarly criminalized organizations, and procure evidence about it. We will then expand our inquiry from Sicily to cases from all over the world, to examine questions about social relations, law, the uses of culture, and political imagination.

ANTH UN3091,Disability,"This course centers 
disability 
in its many manifestations and meanings – as an embodied, social, and cultural experience, as an organizing discourse in local and global contexts, as an analytic framework, and as a position from which to approach, think about, and engage in the world. Together, we will seek to understand disability in diverse settings and contexts through ethnographic texts, autobiography, documentary film, and essays, drawing primarily from works in anthropology but also more broadly from the interdisciplinary traditions known as (Critical) Disability Studies.
  
Throughout the semester, we will move between considering disability in more and less specific and categorical terms. We will ask what the stakes are – intellectually, socially, politically -  for different ways of doing, thinking, and representing disability. What becomes apparent when we consider, say, the experiences of deaf young adults in India working together to learn Indian Sign Language, or physically disabled adults in the United States whose disabilities must be situated within histories of racialized poverty and urban neglect? What happens – what are the resonances and the tensions – when we put these settings into conversation? Through our engagements with materials analyzing these and many other instances, we will think together about what it means to study and think with disability from different disciplinary perspectives, different methods, and different media.",Elizabeth M Green,2:10pm,4:00pm,00879,,W3091-20253-001,,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3091-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253ANTH3091W001,SEMINAR
ANTH UN3151,LIVING WITH ANIMALS: ANTHROPOLOGICAL PER,"This course examines how humans and animals shape each other’s lives, using the tools and perspectives of anthropology. We’ll explore the astounding diversity of human-animal relationships in time and space, tracing the ways animals have made their impact on human societies (and vice-versa). Using contemporary ethnographic, historical, and archaeological examples from a variety of geographical regions and chronological periods, this class will consider how humans and animals live and work together, and the ways in which humans have found animals “good to think with”.  In this course, we will also discuss how knowledge about human-animal relationships in the past might change contemporary and future approaches to living with animals. Through the reading and thinking that this course requires, you will explore what an anthropological perspective on living with animals looks like and how thinking about animals might change anthropology.",Hannah Chazin,10:10am,11:25am,10047,,W3151-20253-001,LIVING WITH ANIMALS: ANTHROPOL,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3151-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20253ANTH3151W001,LECTURE
ANTH UN3663,The Ancient Table: Archaeology of Cookin,"Prerequisites: None Humans don’t just eat to live. The ways we prepare, eat, and share our food is a complex reflection of our histories, environments, and ideologies. Whether we prefer coffee or tea, cornbread or challah, chicken breast or chicken feet, our tastes are expressive of social ties and social boundaries, and are linked to ideas of family and of foreignness. How did eating become such a profoundly cultural experience? This seminar takes an archaeological approach to two broad issues central to eating: First, what drives human food choices both today and in the past? Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies. Topics that will be covered include the nature of the first cooking, beer-brewing and feasting, writing of the early recipes, gender roles and ‘domestic’ life, and how a national cuisine takes shape. Through the course of the semester we will explore food practices from Pleistocene Spain to historic Monticello, with particular emphasis on the earliest cuisines of China, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean.",Camilla Sturm,10:10am,12:00pm,00784,,W3663-20253-001,ANCT TBL: ARCH COOKING &,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3663-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253ANTH3663W001,SEMINAR

ANTH UN3728,ETHNOGRAPHIES OF BLACK LIFE,"This course explores themes that have shaped Anthropology’s (often fraught) engagement with Black life. We will critically examine texts that reveal the ways that the discipline and its practitioners have sought to interface with people and populations of African descent—and have sought to define the constitution of Blackness itself—in the Americas. Plumbing the dynamic relationship between historical and ethnographic inquiry, we will ask pressing questions not only about conditions of Black life (and Black death), but also about the production of knowledge about the people who live under Blackness’ sign. Finally, we will turn our collective attention to key issues in the practice, ethics, and politics of ethnography, while also immersing ourselves in the archives produced through ethnographic and auto-ethnographic practice, including those found in various NYC collections.",Vanessa L Agard-Jones,12:10pm,2:00pm,10613,,V3728-20253-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3728-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ANTH UN3829,ABSENCE/PRESENCE,"Prerequisites: Open to undergrad majors; others with the instructors permission. Across a range of cultural and historic contexts, one encounters traces of bodies - and persons - rendered absent, invisible, or erased. Knowledge of the ghostly presence nevertheless prevails, revealing an inextricable relationship between presence and absence. This course addresses the theme of absent bodies in such contexts as war and other memorials, clinical practices, and industrialization, with interdisciplinary readings drawn from anthropology, war and labor histories, and dystopic science fiction.",Nicholas A Bartlett,10:10am,12:00pm,00785,,V3829-20253-001,ABSENT BODIES,Anthropology @Barnard,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3829-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253ANTH3829V001,SEMINAR
ANTH UN3851,Theatricality & the Political,"This course addresses the articulation between theatricality and the political from a cross-cultural and trans-historical perspective. From the Renaissance theater to the profuse baroque, to the modernizing logics and aesthetics, to so-called “neo-baroque”, the course addresses logics and grammars within past and present dramaturgies of the social. How do certain theatrical traditions articulate with various power formations? How do these connect and complicate the relation between power and resistance, colonialism and liberation, center and periphery, particular and universal, actors and audiences? What technical apparatuses, cultural structures, ethical dispositions and bodily repertoires are mobilized? And how do old and new media technologies reconfigure protocols of stage-form in ancient and contemporary political theater?",Maria Jose de Abreu,2:10pm,4:00pm,10148,,W3851-20253-001,Theatricality & the Polit,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/W3851-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ANTH UN3888,ECOCRITICISM FOR THE END TIMES,"Prerequisites: the instructors permission. This seminar aims to show what an anthropologically informed, ecocritical cultural studies can offer in this moment of intensifying ecological calamity. The course will not only engage significant works in anthropology, ecocriticism, philosophy, literature, politics, and aesthetics to think about the environment, it will also bring these works into engaged reflection on living in the end times (borrowing cultural critic Slavoj Zizeks phrase). The seminar will thus locate critical perspectives on the environment within the contemporary worldwide ecological crisis, emphasizing the ethnographic realities of global warming, debates on nuclear power and energy, and the place of nature. Drawing on the professors long experience in Japan and current research on the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster, the seminar will also take care to unpack the notion of end times, with its apocalyptic implications, through close considerations of works that take on the question of ecocatastrophe in our times. North American and European perspectives, as well as international ones (particularly ones drawn from East Asia), will give the course a global reach.",Marilyn Ivy,4:10pm,6:00pm,11406,,V3888-20253-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Ivy,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3888-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ANTH UN3921,ANTICOLONIALISM,"The age of colonialism, so it seems, is long over. Decolonization has resulted in the emergence of postcolonial polities and societies that are now, in many instances, two generations old. But is it clear that the problem of colonialism has disappeared? Almost everywhere in the postcolonial world the project of building independent polities, economies and societies have faltered, sometimes run aground. Indeed, one might say that the anti-colonial dream of emancipation has evaporated. Through a careful exploration of the conceptual argument and rhetorical style of five central anti-colonial texts—C.L.R. James’ The Black Jacobins, Mahatma Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj, Aimé Cesairé’s Discourse on Colonialism, Albert Memmi’s Colonizer and Colonized, and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth—this course aims to inquire into the image of colonialism as a structure of dominant power, and the image of its anticipated aftermaths: What were the perceived ill-effects of colonial power? What did colonialism do to the colonized that required rectification? In what ways did the critique of colonial power (the identification of what was wrong with it) shape the longing for its anti-colonial overcoming?",David Scott,10:10am,12:00pm,12477,,V3921-20253-001,,Anthropology,ANTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ANTH/V3921-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ANTH UN3999,SENIOR THESIS SEM IN ANTHROPOL,"Prerequisites: The instructors permission. Students must have declared a major in Anthropology prior to registration. Students must have a 3.6 GPA in the major and a preliminary project concept in order to be considered. Interested students must communicate/meet with thesis instructor in the previous spring about the possibility of taking the course during the upcoming academic year. Additionally, expect to discuss with the instructor at the end of the fall term whether your project has progressed far enough to be completed in the spring term. If it has not, you will exit the seminar after one semester, with a grade based on the work completed during the fall term. This two-term course is a combination of a seminar and a workshop that will help you conduct research, write, and present an original senior thesis in anthropology. Students who write theses are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The first term of this course introduces a variety of approaches used to produce anthropological knowledge and writing; encourages students to think critically about the approaches they take to researching and writing by studying model texts with an eye to the ethics, constraints, and potentials of anthropological research and writing; and gives students practice in the seminar and workshop formats that are key to collegial exchange and refinement of ideas. During the first term, students complete a few short exercises that will culminate in a substantial draft of one discrete section of their senior project (18-20 pages) plus a detailed outline of the expected work that remains to be done (5 pages). The spring sequence of the anthropology thesis seminar is a writing intensive continuation of the fall semester, in which students will have designed the research questions, prepared a full thesis proposal that will serve as a guide for the completion of the thesis and written a draft of one chapter. Only those students who expect to have completed the fall semester portion of the course are allowed to register for the spring; final enrollment is contingent upon successful completion of first semester requirements. In spring semester, weekly meetings will be devoted to the collaborative refinement of drafts, as well as working through issues of writing (evidence, voice, authority etc.). All enrolled students are required to present their project at a symposium in the late spring, and the final grade is based primarily on successful completion of the thesis/ capstone project.

ARCH GU4260,Colonial Cities in the French Empire,"French colonialism in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by a relentless and often oppressive pursuit of overseas territories. Colonial cities, the focal points of the French empire, were erected in the nation’s image and characterized by wide boulevards, impressive parks and squares, and monumental buildings echoing the elegance of Paris. These urban centers, scattered across Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean, often served as administrative, economic, and cultural hubs for the colonial administration.   This seminar will explore the profound impact of colonial cities as laboratories for experimenting with new ideas in city planning, infrastructure, architecture, and civic governance. Once tried and tested in the colonies, these innovative “norms and forms” were often imported back to metropolitan France, where they helped shape various aspects of its society, culture, and economy.   The seminar is chronologically structured around six French colonial cities: Cap-Français, Cairo, Algiers, Casablanca, Dakar, and Hanoi. Each city is examined through the lens of a distinct set of colonial policies and practices. Cap-Français is studied from the perspective of the universalist values of the French Enlightenment and the double standard evident in the terror of the Atlantic slave trade. Cairo, while colonized for only a brief period, ignited new passions for the East and is viewed as a repository of exotic fantasies and a site for infrastructural modernization. Algiers is studied through the policy of assimilation and the destruction of Algerian religious identity. Casablanca is considered in relation to new planning practices and colonial policies of association. Hanoi is examined through cultural and architectural forms of hybridity. Finally, Dakar is viewed through colonial theories of acclimatization and hygiene policies. As we traverse the diverse landscapes of these colonial cities, this seminar invites participants to critically reﬂect on the enduring echoes of French colonialism, exploring how the urban experiments of the past reverberate in the present and inﬂuence our perceptions of global cities and their histories.",Ralph Ghoche,4:10pm,6:00pm,00715,,W4260-20253-001,Colonial Cities in French,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W4260-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4-8,,M,20253ARCH4260W001,SEMINAR
ARCH GU4305,ABOLITION ARCHITECTURE,"This seminar introduces students to architectural and environmental histories of abolition through constructed environments, spatial practices, and texts from the eighteenth century to the present. The course locates abolition in social movements and historical discourses, examining the roles that both reform and radical refusal have played in struggles for spatial justice by considering debates around enslavement, prisons, and borders. The course situates abolition as a significant intersectional feminist problem, and conceptually core to the consideration of race in global architectural history. We examine individual and collective works of architecture, art, landscape, and material culture, which highlight incarceration and the production of enclosure within the institutions that have shaped them in various parts of the world, and as elements of the formation of space, power, and knowledge in colonial and postcolonial contexts.
  
The seminar is structured around multiple full-book engagements. We will closely read three texts that are foundational to the literature on abolition and architecture: 
Are Prisons Obsolete? 
by Angela Y. Davis; 
Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California 
by Ruth Wilson Gilmore; and 
Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration 
by Nicole Fleetwood. These readings are complemented by articles and other shorter texts, and works of art and architecture, which help to contextualize and draw out the themes of the course. Each student leads seminars on the readings and builds on this foundation by engaging in independent research, culminating in a long-format paper that intervenes in the discourse or frames a narrative, presenting an architectural history of abolition.",Anooradha I Siddiqi,10:10am,12:00pm,00714,,W4305-20253-001,,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W4305-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253ARCH4305W001,SEMINAR

ARCH UN1030,THE CITY: THINKING WITH THE URBAN BUILT,"This experiential learning course provides an introduction to the organization and design of the urban built environment. What kinds of spaces make up the city, how are they formed, and what impact do they have on people’s lives? We will consider these key questions of urban design and the distinct answers that have arisen in different historical and geographical contexts, with reference to a global array of case studies. And we will use the built environment of New York City as our classroom, with weekly field trips to iconic (and iconoclastic) examples of urban form, including sites from all five boroughs that reflect a diversity of cultural milieux. Through this comparative approach, the class will challenge the naïve view that the built environment is neutral or inert, emphasizing instead the inherent politics of urban design and the ongoing transformation and contestation of urban space. To arrive at this understanding, students will learn to think with the city, acquiring tools for understanding, representing, and analyzing the urban built environment.
  
The class is organized morphologically into six modules: image, park, plaza, street, block, and arcade. During each unit, students will also be introduced to a specific technique for analyzing urban form: figure-ground, collage, plan, diagram, map, projection, and section. The main assignments ask students to deploy these techniques to compare the urban spaces we encounter in the city.",Nick R Smith,9:00am,12:50pm,00698,,W1030-20253-001,THE CITY,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W1030-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,F,20253ARCH1030W001,LECTURE

ARCH UN2530,Life Beyond Emergency: Ecologies & Inhab,"Life Beyond Emergency
 examines constructed environments and spatial practices in contexts of displacement, within the connected histories of colonialism and humanitarianism. People migrating under duress, seeking refuge, practicing mutual aid, and sheltering in governmental or nongovernmental settings invest in the built environment as a holder of knowledge, critical heritage, and imaginaries of life beyond emergency. The course considers a politics and poetics of architectures and infrastructures of partitions, borders, and camps: territories and domesticities of concern to authorities and inhabited by ordinary people forging solidarities and futures. We will investigate the connected histories and theories of humanitarianism and colonialism, which have not only shaped lives as people inhabit spaces of emergency, but produced rationales for the construction of landscapes and domesticities of refuge, enacted spatial violence and territorial contestations, and structured architectural knowledge. The course examines iconic forms such as refugee camps in relation to colonial institutions such as archives. From Somalia to Palestine to Bangladesh and beyond, our inquiry into contested territories where people have been forced to migrate invites students to interrogate the normalized discourses and spaces, for example, of ‘borderlands,’ or ‘refugees,’ in order to imagine and analyze emergency environments as constructions that people have resisted, endured, transcended, theorized, and inhabited.",Anooradha I Siddiqi,1:10pm,2:25pm,00704,,W2530-20253-001,Life Beyond Emergency,Architecture @Barnard,ARCH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ARCH/W2530-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ARCH2530W001,LECTURE

We begin by exploring ethnolinguistic diversity of the Red River plain over the first millenium BCE, culminating in the material bronze culture known as the Dong Son. We then turn towards the introduction of high sinitic culture, and the region's long membership within successive Chinese empires. We pay special attention to the rise of an independent state out of the crumbling Tang Dynasty, and the specific nation-building effects of war with the Mongols and the Ming Dynasty, in the 14th and 15th centuries respectively. Our class ends with the French colonization of the region, and the dramatic cultural and intellectual transformations that were triggered as a result. Our course will interrogate Vietnamese culture as a protean object, one that is defined and redefined at virtually every level, throughout a history marked by foreign interest, influence, and invasion.",John D Phan,4:10pm,5:25pm,10922,,W1367-20253-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,ASCE,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ASCE/W1367-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,ASCE UN1377,MW,20253ASCE1367W001,LECTURE

BIET PS5320,INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHICAL BIOETHICS,"In contemporary bioethics, we find ourselves grappling with practically important, and at the same time, philosophically fundamental questions such as: When does someone’s life begin and how should it end? What is the proper role of physicians, nurses and other health care providers and what are the rights of their patients? What is a just and fair way to provide access to health-care services and resources? Which potential uses of new genetic and reproductive technologies would represent a legitimate advance in medicine and which would signify the beginning of a humanly degrading ""brave new world""? Indeed, in a society committed to protecting a diversity of lifestyles and opinions, how can citizens resolve significant policy controversies such as whether there should be public funding of human embryonic stem cell research, or a legally protected right to physician assistance in ending one’s life?
  
The aims of this course are to identify the fundamental ethical questions that underlie contemporary biomedical practice; develop skill in analyzing and clarifying key concepts such as autonomy, justice, health and disease; critically assess the healthcare implications of different ethical outlooks; explore how citizens can reasonably address controversial bioethical issues in a mutually respectful and constructive way.
  
The course meets once a week for an hour and a half. Live-session interaction and post-session discussion forums play a key role as students explore, in a give-and-take spirit, the pros and cons of each position.
  
This course is designed for medical students, nursing students, and other healthcare professionals, as well as for students at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level in biology, philosophy, political science, public health, law, and related fields.",Arthur Kuflik,12:00pm,2:30pm,12991,,K5320-20253-001,INTRO TO PHILOSOPHICAL BI,Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5320-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Nursing

Students will explore and contrast legal reasoning and bioethical analysis, often of the same issues. By the end of the course, students will understand the legal or regulatory status of selected issues and have begun to independently navigate major legal, regulatory, and policy texts. Individual sessions will be focused around particular issues or questions that have been addressed by (usually) American courts and/or in legislation, regulation or policy, and that have been the subject of scholarship and debate within bioethics.
  
The course begins with a theoretical look at the relationship between law and ethics, and includes a brief introduction to legal decision-making and policy development.

BIET PS5400,CLINICAL ETHICS,"While this course is designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of clinical ethics and the basic terminology and framework of ethical analysis in biomedical ethics, it offers a more sociological perspective, putting the contemporary clinical issues into a broader context. We will look briefly at the development of clinical ethics and its impact on hospital care and doctor-patient relationships, on the prevailing autonomy norm and its critique. The course then focuses on issues encountered in clinical practice such as informed consent, patient capacity, decision-making, end of life, advance directives, medical futility, pediatrics ethics, maternal-fetal conflicts, organ transplantation, cultural competence and diversity of beliefs and others. The course will examine the role of the clinical ethics consultant (CEC) and assignments will mimic the work that CECs may perform in the hospital setting.
  
Over the span of the semester, students become familiar with the ethical questions surrounding major topics in the clinic with a practical case-based approach toward ethics dilemmas and ethics consultation. During the semester, students in New York attend a meeting of the adult or pediatric ethics committees of New York Presbyterian and Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital or another area hospital, as well as ethics lectures given at the medical center.
  
Students are expected to complete five case write-ups using a template that will be given by the instructor. Students will be using these cases to refine and hone their ethical analysis skills and to show their knowledge of law, policy and ethical principles and how they might apply to each situation.",Barbra Rothschild,3:45pm,5:45pm,12995,,K5400-20253-D01,,Bioethics,BIET,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIET/K5400-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Nursing

BIET PS5430,ETHICS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY,"The development of a new drug is a long and expensive process, involving thousands of discrete processes and decisions. Most of these processes reflect some level of ethical diligence and may even be governed by local law. There are a range of formal mechanisms in place in the complex drug development industry (e.g., regulatory requirements, Institutional Review Boards, internal bioethics committees, legislative requirements) to ensure that ethical issues are considered and that best ethical practices are applied throughout the process. And yet, ethical challenges and considerations persist and evolve.   This online 3-credit course will examine some of the major components and drivers of the drug development process from an array of perspectives and analyze the ethical issues surrounding these constituent steps, stages, and components. The course is an elective in the Master of Science Bioethics program and is open, space permitting, to cross-registrants from other fields and/or Columbia University programs. The course is designed for anyone with an interest in the ethics of pharmaceutical product development and the research required to enable it.

We will evaluate internal and external sources of institutional direction and values. The exercise of authority by different stakeholders produces a cumulative impact on organizational ethics and compliance.

Course overview: 
  
Once a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.",Vincent D Fitzpatrick,1:10pm,4:00pm,00747,,X2500-20253-001,R for Scientists,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/X2500-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,F,20253BIOL2500X001,LECTURE
BIOL BC3007,Introduction to RNA-Seq Analysis,"Prerequisites: BIOL BC1500,1501, 1502, 1503 and BIOL BC2100, or equivalent.
  
Transcriptome analysis, or the analysis of all expressed RNA sequences in a cell, has long been a major part of molecular biology and genetics. The modern technique of RNA-Seq has now been established as the approach for transcriptome studies and RNA-Seq analyses are ubiquitous in all areas of Biology. In this course we will cover the major technical and analytical aspects of RNA-Seq with an emphasis on the application by students to real datasets. We will cover both the original ‘Bulk RNA-Seq’ approach, where the total transcriptome of many cells are combined, and the more recent ‘single-cell RNA-Seq’ (scRNA-Seq) technology where transcriptomes of individual cells are analyzed separately. Students will learn to read and interpret journal articles that utilize RNA-Seq datasets, both bulk and single-cell, and to perform and present RNA-Seq data using publicly available datasets.",Brian Morton,1:10pm,4:00pm,00748,,X3007-20253-001,Intro to RNA-Seq Analysis,Biological Sciences @Barnard,BIOL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/X3007-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,"BIOL BC1500

BIOL GU4036,Transformative Concepts in Systems Biolo,"Systems biology approaches are rapidly transforming the technological and conceptual foundations of research across diverse areas of biomedicine. In this course we will discuss the fundamental developments in systems biology with a focus on two important dimensions: (1) the unique conceptual frameworks that have emerged to study systems-level phenomena and (2) how these approaches are revealing fundamentally new principles that govern the organization and behavior of cellular systems. Although there will be much discussion of technologies and computational approaches, the course will emphasize the conceptual contributions of the field and the big questions that lie ahead. Lectures and discussions of primary literature will enable students to scrutinize research in the field and to internalize systems biology thinking in their own research. To make this a concrete endeavor, the students will develop mini-NIH-style grant proposals that aims to study a fundamental problem/question using systems biology approaches. The students will then convene an in-class NIH-style review panel that will assess the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals. In addition, the students will have the opportunity to defend their proposals in a live presentation to the class. The course is open to graduate students in Biological Sciences.

The course has two equally important goals. The first goal is to explain the fundamental approaches used by physical chemists to understand  the behavior of molecules and to develop related analytical tools. The second goal is to prepare students to apply these methods themselves to their own molecular biology research projects. The course will be divided into seven modules: (i) solution thermodynamics with an emphasis on application to analysis of protein structure, folding, and binding interactions; (ii) hydrodynamic methods; (iii) statistical analysis of experimental data; (iv) molecular dynamics calculations; (v) optical spectroscopy with an emphasis on fluorescence; (vi) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and (vii) light-scattering and diffraction methods including an overview of cryogenic electron microscopy reconstruction methods. In each module, the underlying physical theories and models will be presented and used to derive the mathematical equations applied to the analysis of experimental data.  Weekly recitations will emphasize the analysis of real experimental data and understanding the applications of biophysical experimentation in published research papers.  The problem sets emphasize use of PyMOL for analysis of macromolecular structures and use of standard curve-fitting software for analysis of protein binding data; detailed tutorials on the related methods are provided in the recitation sections.  The first three modules will be covered in Biophysical Chemistry I during the fall term, while the final three  will be covered in Biophysical Chemistry II during the spring term, and treatment of molecular dynamics calculations will be divided between the two terms.",,1:10pm,2:25pm,12960,,W4323-20253-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W4323-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20253BIOL4323W001,LECTURE

The course will be focused on teaching classic and contemporary concepts in genetics and neuroscience, rather than cataloguing mere facts. The course will emphasize the discovery processes, historical figures involved in these processes and methodologies of discovery. Primary research papers will be discussed in detail. A central organizational theme of the course is the presence of a common thread and narrative throughout the course. The common thread is an invertebrate model system, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which serves as a paradigm to show how simple genetic model systems have informed our view on the genetics of nervous system development and function. The ultimate goal of this course is to gain an understanding of the underlying principles of how the nervous system of one specific animal species forms, from beginning to end. The course is intended for neuroscience-inclined students (e.g. neuroscience majors) who want to learn about how genetic approaches have informed our understanding of brain development and function and, vice versa, for students with an interest in molecular biology and genetics, who want to learn about key problems in neuroscience and how genetic approaches can address them.",Oliver Hobert,8:40am,9:55am,10125,,W3025-20253-001,,Biological Sciences,BIOL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/BIOL/W3025-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,"BIOL UN2005

This course – though far from exhaustive in its coverage – will present a sample of genres (music, plastic arts, theater, dance, installation, photography) in a variety of locations and times to understand how art and artists have engaged in protest. Much of modern art is conceptual, using installations and performance, to communicate. Therefore, we will start the class by turning to T. J. Clark, the preeminent art historian, for his answer to the question, when did modern art begin? This question will lead us to explore the debate on the purpose of art. We will then move to how artists responded to moments of crisis in the early 20th century - world wars, economic depression, and the rise of fascism – because the art that emerged informs much of what we see today. Based on these foundational questions, the class will turn to case studies from around the globe.",Ramona H Bajema,4:10pm,6:00pm,11477,,G6312-20253-001,ART IN PROTEST-PROTEST IN,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/G6312-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,M,20253CGTH6312G001,SEMINAR
CGTH GU4400,Global New York,"“Wall Street is a disaster area”—so declared a real estate lawyer in a 1974 
New York Times
 story on the pitiful state of lower Manhattan. The World Trade Center had been inaugurated in 1973 as a beacon of global capitalism with a mandate to lease only to international firms. A year later, much of the Twin Towers went unoccupied. Some eight million square feet of financial district office space sat empty, brokerage houses were shuttering at a rate of more than one per day, and the surrounding city was hurtling towards a full-blown fiscal crisis. The New York of the mid-1970s did not appear destined to become the model global city we know today. Within a decade, however, the city had transformed into a central node—arguably 
the 
central node—in the ballooning global financial industry and its accompanying class and cultural formations. But this outcome was never guaranteed. How did New York go from “Fear City” to “Capital of the World”? What historical structures, contingencies, and policy decisions produced Global New York?
  
This course examines New York City’s long history as a site of globalization. Since European colonization, New York has served as a hub in world-spanning networks of capital, goods, and people.
 
At the same time, the city’s reinvention in the late-20th century as a “global city”—defined in large part by its deep embeddedness in world financial markets—represented a fundamental shift in the city’s economy, governance, demography, cultural life, and social relations.
 
We will interrogate how this came to be by exploring New York’s historical role in global business, culture, and immigration, with attention to how local and national conditions have shaped the city’s relationship to the world. While critically analyzing how elites both in and outside New York have wielded power over its politics and institutions, readings and discussions will also center the voices of New Yorkers drawn from the numerous and diverse communities that make up this complex city.",Sarah A Miller-Davenport,2:10pm,4:00pm,11271,,W4400-20253-001,,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/W4400-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253CGTH4400W001,SEMINAR
CGTH GU4600,Global Cities,"While globalization has in certain respects “flattened” the world, there is simultaneously a distinct geographic logic to what Manuel Castells refers to as the “space of flows” that defines our current age. Specifically, by serving as central nodes in the worldwide circulation of everything from capital, goods, people, and viruses to ideas, cultural products, and aesthetic preferences, urban areas—and especially those often labeled as “global cities”—are constitutive of modern life. Accordingly, city spaces provide an ideal vantage point from which to contemplate diverse global processes.
  
Accordingly, this course will focus on cities as globally
 
embedded units and agents. While this will naturally entail paying particular attention to “superstar cities”—such as New York, London, Shanghai, Dubai, and São Paulo—we will also explore how smaller urban areas, including in the Global South, simultaneously participate in globalizing processes and are subjected to globalizing forces. Additionally, we will drill deeper by analyzing how micro-level spaces 
within
 cities—including neighborhoods, and even particular streets and buildings—are implicated in, and generative of, these same global flows.
  
Throughout, we will highlight the dialectical nature of (global) cities and the imaginaries that exist about them, as places defined by both egalitarianism and stratification, freedom and danger, cosmopolitanism and localism, sustainability and ecocide, and utopian dreams and dystopian nightmares. Our broader aims, then, are to understand how the mutual imbrication of 
the local
 and 
the global
 within cities generates tendencies that simultaneously 
flatten
 space while also 
accentuating
 disparate socio-spatial dynamics and inequalities. And, second, to consider how cities are on the frontlines of many of the most pressing problems facing humanity, as well as efforts to address them.",Kevin Funk,10:10am,12:00pm,11340,,G4600-20253-001,,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/G4600-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253CGTH4600G001,SEMINAR
CGTH GU4725,Global Latin America,"Within the Global North social-science mainstream, Latin America (like other parts of the Global South) has often been conceptualized as a region of analytical interest due to its complex 
internal
 dynamics (relating, for example, to recurring authoritarian rule, democratization, transitional justice, “modernization” and economic development, and social mobilization). Yet until recently, these have infrequently been conceptualized as 
global 
processes in which Latin America plays a substantive role. To be sure, various 
external 
forces—namely, colonialism, imperialism, interventionism, and their legacies—are of course widely understood to have shaped Latin American in myriad ways. However, the notions that Latin America exercises agency (or at least matters) in world affairs, is more than a generally passive recipient of global flows, and is meaningfully connected to other regions (including through migratory, political, economic, and cultural linkages), have only recently begun to resonate within the Northern academy.   
  
In contrast to the “methodological nationalism” (or “regionalism”) that has long characterized outside analysis of Latin America, this course foregrounds the region’s global embeddedness and world-making potential—as a protagonist in the generation, adaptation, and diffusion of diverse border-crossing flows, frameworks, and imaginaries. These include: global discourses concerning modernity, postmodernity, liberalism, and postcolonialism; global understandings of race, class, gender, and the intersections between them; global policy frameworks related to human rights, democracy, and economic development; historical and contemporary globalizing relations with distant parts of the world, including the Middle East and Asia; and global alternatives to a world order based on exclusion, extractivism, and environmental degradation.     
  
Throughout, we will highlight the agency of state and non-state actors throughout “Latin America”—itself a homogenizing, Eurocentric label imposed from the outside—as constitutive forces in creating the world that we all inhabit, contributing to the problems that confront us, and helping to generate solutions. To do so, we will engage with a series of texts and materials produced by diversely situated interdisciplinary scholars, writers, artists, and political figures—many of them based in Latin America, an",Kevin Funk,10:10am,12:00pm,11279,,W4725-20253-001,,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/W4725-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253CGTH4725W001,SEMINAR
CGTH UN3402,YOUTH-INTERCONNECTED WRLD,"What does it mean to be 20 years old in our rapidly changing, interconnected world? There are more youth (aged 15-25) in the world today than at any other time in history, with the majority living in the developing world. They approach adulthood as the world confronts seismic shifts in the geopolitical order, in the nature and future of work, and in the ways we connect with each other, express identity, engage politically, and create communities of meaning. What unique challenges and opportunities confront young people after decades of neoliberal globalization? What issues are most pressing in developing nations experiencing a “youth bulge” and how do they compare to developed nations with rapidly aging populations? How do young people envision their futures and the future of the world they are inheriting? This course will examine recent scholarship while engaging the young people in the class to define the agenda and questions of the course, and to conduct their own research. This course is part of the Global Core curriculum. “Global 20” complements a new research project of the Committee on Global Thought, “Youth in a Changing World,” which investigates from the perspective of diverse participants and of young people themselves, the most pressing issues confronting young people in the changing world today. The course will serve as an undergraduate “lab” for the project, and among other involvements, students in the course will help conceive, plan, and take part in a NYC-wide “Youth Think-In” sponsored by the CGT during the Spring 2018 semester. Within the course, students will become “regional experts” and examine the primary themes of the class through the prism of specific areas or nations of their choosing. A final class project includes a “design session” that will consider how universities might better train and empower youth to confront the challenges and embrace the opportunities of our interconnected world of the 21stcentury.",Laura L Neitzel,12:10pm,2:00pm,11268,,W3402-20253-001,,Committee on Global Thought,CGTH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CGTH/W3402-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253CGTH3402W001,SEMINAR

 play that is put on by the Barnard and Columbia Ancient Drama Group each year, though
 it is open to any student interested in the aesthetics and politics of theater and drama.
 Course focus and some content will rotate year to year, calibrated to serve the play or
 plays chosen by the student director. We will read these and other relevant other plays or
 similarly adjacent texts, as well as scholarly literature on topics centered around the body
 in performance, including ancient theaters and stage space, costumes and masks,
 deportment and gestures, proxemics, and so on. We will also explore aspects of ancient
 drama and theatricality that relate to translation and reception, as well as inflections of
 gender and status. Other topics may include the mythic background (e.g., in epic and/or
 lyric), politics of aesthetics in ancient Athens, and gender-genre dynamics.
 Each component will extend over three or four classes and consider the ancient
 plays through readings of primary texts (in translation) and conceptual / contextual
 backgrounds. There will be an additional class hour for those who wish to read the play
 in the original language (signed up for as a 1-point directed reading).",Nancy Worman,2:40pm,3:55pm,00445,,X3212-20253-001,,Classics @Barnard,CLCV,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Worman,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/X3212-20253-001/,To be announced,,,0-3,,TR,20253CLCV3212X001,LECTURE

 Offering various approaches to world building and sometimes contradictory ethical and social reflections, fables
 and their traditions serve as the ideal ground for exploring a variety of literary, methodological, and sociological
 questions from the iron age to late antiquity.This course offers an exploration in translation of the fable as a

The first part of the course will establish context, before laying out a narrative framework; the second part of the course will explore a series of themes, especially the tension between military conquest, political negotiation, and social interactions.

The archaeology of Nubia is also little known but fascinating on many levels. This course will focus on what archaeology can reveal about life as it was experienced by individuals of all social classes. Through a combination of broad surveys and case studies of some of Egypt and Nubia’s most culturally indicative and intriguing sites, we will explore issues such as the origins of inequality, state formation and its effects, the uneasy mix of state-planned settlements and village life, urbanism, domestic and community worship, gendered spaces, ethnicity and colonialism, religious revolution and evolution, bureaucracy, private enterprise, and the effects of governmental collapse on life and death in ancient Egypt and Nubia.",Ellen Morris,1:10pm,2:25pm,00440,,V3101-20253-001,ARCHAEOL OF ANC EGYPT & N,Classics @Barnard,CLCV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLCV/V3101-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253CLCV3101V001,LECTURE

CLEN UN3455,Pacifism and the Apocalyptic Imagination,"This course examines the evolution of pacifist thought in literature from the interwar years to the dawn of the atomic age. It seeks to study the literature of twentieth-century pacifism as a response to expanding technologies of modern warfare. The course asks the following questions, among others: What shape does pacifist thought take in the atomic age, and how does it compare with interwar pacifism? What similarities or differences are discernible? What role do literary representations of modern warfare play in the evolution of pacifist thought? Does pacifism gain persuasive power through these representations, or do they lay bare its limits? How might one understand pacifism’s conceptual relation to nonviolence, anti-war resistance, and anti-militarism?
  
The course begins with works by pacifist writers in the interwar years: Bertrand Russell, 
Why Men Fight 
(1917); the correspondence between Einstein and Freud in 1932; Aldous Huxley, “What Are You Going to Do About It?” (1936) and 
Eyeless in Gaza
 (1936); Virginia Woolf, 
Three Guineas 
(1938) and “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid” (1940); Vera Brittain, “Women and Peace” (1940). The course then considers the evolution of pacifism in the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, focusing on novels, memoirs, essays, short stories, and films, including the following works: Aldous Huxley, 
Ape and Essence 
(1948); M. K. Gandhi, 
For Pacifists 
(1949); Pearl Buck, 
Command the Morning 
(1959); Alfred Coppel, 
Dark December 
(1960); Masuji Ibuse, 
Black Rain
 (1965); Kenzaburo Oe
, Hiroshima Notes
 (1965) and 
Fire from the Ashes
, ed. (1985); Anand Patwardhan, 
War and Peace
 (2002, documentary); Howard Zinn (ed.), 
The Power of Nonviolence
 (2002).
  
The course encourages students to view selected films probing pacifist and anti-war themes alongside literary and philosophical texts, with a view to grasping the themes’ adaptability across various genres. Students must apply to enrol in the seminar, providing information about year, school, relevant prior coursework, and reasons for wanting to take the course.

CLEN UN3742,The Thirties: Metropole and Colony,"This course focuses on the tumultuous 1930s, which witnessed the growth of anticolonial movements, the coming to power of totalitarian and fascist regimes, and calls for internationalism and a new world vision, among other major developments. Even as fascism laid down its roots in parts of Europe, the struggle for independence from European colonial rule accelerated in Asia and Africa, and former subjects engaged with ideas and images about the shape of their new nations, in essays, fiction, poetry, and theater. Supporters and critics of nationalism existed on both sides of the metropole-colony divide, as calls for internationalism sought to stem the rising tide of ethnocentric thinking and racial particularism in parts of Europe as well as the colonies. Ostensibly a gesture of resistance against imperial control, anti-colonialism also sparked debates about re-visioning gender relations, the place of minorities in the nation, religious difference and secularism, and models of world unity, among other issues. The course aims to consider the intersection of these debates with resistance to 1930s fascism: Did anti- fascist resistance in the metropole draw inspiration from anticolonial struggles? Conversely, did the spectre of fascism and authoritarianism present a cautionary tale to the project of nation-building in former colonies?
  
We will read works from both the metropole and the colonies to track the crisscrossing of ideas, beginning with writers whose works foreshadowed the convulsive events of the 1930s and beyond (H.G. Wells, E.M. Forster, Rabindranath Tagore), then moving on to writers who published some of their greatest work in the 1930s (Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Mulk Raj Anand, M.K. Gandhi, Raja Rao, C.L.R. James), and concluding with an author who reassessed the events of the 1930s from a later perspective (George Lamming).",Gauri Viswanathan,4:10pm,6:00pm,11753,,W3742-20253-001,The Thirties: Metropole/C,English and Comparative Literature,CLEN,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauri_Viswanathan,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLEN/W3742-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

Swann’s Way

CLFR GU4292,QUEER MEDIEVAL FRANCE,"What did it mean to be queer in the francophone Middle Ages? Was there such a thing? The term ‘sodomy’ was used in the period to describe a wide variety of acts (not all sexual), and the term would seem to foreclose the possibility of female same-sex eroticism. In an era in which all non-procreative sex was conceived as sinful, does the opposition between homosexual and heterosexual still hold? Was male and female homosexuality conceived symmetrically? Topics include the construction of gender (binary vs. spectral, natural vs. cultural), gender variance (transgender and nonbinary people), sodomy and the contours of “sex,” and sadomasochism. Our readings will take us through a broad range of genres—from penance manuals to lyric poetry to romance. Texts include selected

This seminar examines dictatorships and the ways in which they are remembered, discussed, examined, and give rise to conflicting narratives in post-dictatorial environments. It takes as its point of departure the Greek military regime of 1967-1974, which is considered in relation to other dictatorships in South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. We will be drawing on primary materials including Amnesty International reports, film, performance art, and architectural drawings as well as the works of Hannah Arendt and Günter Grass to engage in an interdisciplinary examination of the ways in which military dictatorships live on as ghosts, traumatic memories, urban warfare, litigation, and debates on the politics of comparison and the ethics of contemporary art.",Dimitris Antoniou,12:10pm,2:00pm,11282,,W3005-20253-001,DICTATORSHIPS&THEIR AFTER,Classics,CLGM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLGM/W3005-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253CLGM3005W001,SEMINAR

The objective is twofold: 1) to determine which elements in democratic culture remain fundamental, no matter what form they take in various historical instances; 2) to understand that the culture of democracy is indeed not abstract and transcendental but historical, with its central impetus being the interrogation and transformation of society. Special emphasis will be placed on the crisis of democratic institutions in the era of globalization and, as specific case-study in point, the democratic failure in the Mediterranean region in light of the challenges of the assembly movements (Spain, Greece, Arab Spring) and the current migrant/refugee crisis.",Stathis Gourgouris,12:10pm,2:00pm,11283,,W3937-20253-001,,Classics,CLGM,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stathis_Gourgouris,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLGM/W3937-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253CLGM3937W001,SEMINAR

 was published more than 200 years ago, their fairy tales continue to enchant readers.

We will work with fairy tale theory (narrative, psychoanalytic, historical) and discuss the function of the tales as folklore as well as their status as children’s literature. Alongside the “original” Grimms’ tales—a concept that we will discuss—a major portion of the course will engage the legacy of the fairy tales and the way they have been appropriated by others, particularly from a critical, feminist perspective.
  
Points of emphasis will include: how writers in the first half of the 20th century politicized the tales in the battle for social change during the time of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany; how the tales were reinterpreted in different national traditions and historical periods; how the fairy tale become a mass culture icon in Disney’s film versions; and how contemporary writers like Margaret Atwood continue to employ tales in questioning and challenging traditional constructions of gender.",Annie Pfeifer,1:10pm,2:25pm,11430,,W3000-20253-001,"Fairy Tales: Power, Gende",Germanic Languages,CLGR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLGR/W3000-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253CLGR3000W001,LECTURE

CLME GU4226,ARABIC AUTOBIOGRAPHY GLOBAL DIMENSIONS,"This course draws a map of Arab thought and culture in its multiple engagements with other cultures. It works globally along two lines: a theoretical one that accommodates conceptualizations of self-narrative in relation to shifting categories of center and margin; and a thematic one that selects a number of Arabic autobiographical texts with strong thematic concerns that cut across multiple cultures. Although Europe sounds at times more conspicuous in early 20th century autobiography, the Afro-Asian and Latin American topographical and historical itinerary and context are no less so, especially in writings we associate with societal and cultural transformations. More than historical accounts, these intellectual itineraries speak for the successes and failures of the secular ideology of the Arab nation-state. They convey the struggle of intellectuals-- as self-styled leaders, for an ideal state on the ruins of the past. The course studies a number of autobiographical works; memoirs and reminiscences that are meant to rationalize and reproduce a writer’s experience. Probably self-censored, these serve nevertheless as trajectories for a secular journey rather than one from denial to affirmation. Staunchly established in modernity and its nahdah paradigms, most of these writings are secular itineraries that rarely end in a search for faith. They are the journeys of a generation of Arab intellectuals who are facing many crises, but not the crisis of faith. They provide another look at the making of the Arab intelligentsia- and probably the Afro-Asian and Latin American one, since the early 20th century, and help us discern not only achievements on the level of education and public service , but also the mounting discontent with failures that have been wrapping the formation of the nation state.

CLPS GU4275,TRAUMA AND PLEASURE,"Can the words “trauma” and “pleasure” be put in the same sentence? If trauma epitomizes suffering and pleasure represents enjoyment, is there any relation between these experiences? And yet, how else to explain that people seem endlessly addicted to negative experiences, or that traumatized people often try to recreate the damage they endured?
  
We are living in an age of endless trauma, and everywhere we go, we hear that trauma is destructive, anathema to pleasure, that it destroys our sense of self, our security, our stability, and identity. We are taught to avoid trauma at all costs because it is harmful and inimical to flourishing. New statistics routinely confirm that we are living through a trauma epidemic in which ordinary people experience symptoms of extreme distress, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and difficulty sleeping. Every year, new memoirs are published in which protagonists detail their endless battles with traumatic adversity and most television shows, across a variety of genres, include trauma as a subplot to character development (
Ted Lasso
, 
Euphoria
, 
True Detective
, to name a few). Referring to its growing pervasiveness, the 
New Yorker
 critic Parul Sehgal wrote a controversial essay, “The Case Against the Trauma Plot” (2021) in which she criticizes our culture’s overreliance on trauma as a primary trope of character development, forcing us to ask: is trauma really as widespread as we think? how did trauma become such a popular ‘identity’? what work is trauma doing for us, as individuals and as a culture? Is it possible to recognize the ubiquity of trauma while also acknowledging that we often seek situations which are harmful, even traumatizing, that we might be attracted to suffering for reasons we don’t yet understand?
  
This course examines the complex relationship between trauma and pleasure by familiarizing students with the clinical and theoretical concepts at the core of contemporary trauma and critical theory. We will focus specifically on the topics of: sexuality, perversion, trauma, identity, relationality, narcissism, gender and attachment in order to explore how these concepts work today. Delving into theoretical writing by Foucault, Bersani, Edelman, Berlant, Butler, Dean and Preciado, as well as clinical writing by major psychoanalysts, Freud, Laplanche, Loewald, Lacan, Laplanche and Winnicott, we will redefine contemporary debates by exploring their clinica",Gila Ashtor,10:10am,12:00pm,10320,,W4275-20253-001,,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CLPS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CLPS/W4275-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20253CLPS4275W001,SEMINAR

COGS UN1001,Introduction to Cognitive Science,"The goal of cognitive science — and of this course — is to understand how the mind works. Trying to understand our own minds is perhaps the most ambitious and exciting (and difficult) project in all of science, and this project requires tools drawn from fields including experimental psychology, computer science and artificial intelligence, linguistics, vision science, philosophy, anthropology, behavioral economics, and several varieties of neuroscience (among others). This course will introduce you to the major tools and theories from these areas, as they relate to the study of the mind. We will employ these perspectives while exploring the nature of mental processes such as perception, reasoning, memory, attention, imagery, language, intelligence, decision-making, morality— and even attraction and love. In sum, this course will expose you to cognitive science, the assumptions on which it rests, and many of the most important and fascinating results obtained so far.",,2:40pm,3:55pm,00010,,W1001-20253-001,INTRO TO COGNITIVE SCIENC,Cognitive Science @Barnard,COGS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/COGS/W1001-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253COGS1001W001,LECTURE

The objectives of this foundations course include furthering close reading skills, and exploring theories of self-telling and relationality. At the center of this project is the medical encounter.  In examining the complexities of this exchange, to help clinicians to fulfill their ""receiving"" duties more effectively, we will turn to narrative theory, autobiographical theory, psychoanalytic theory, trauma scholarship and witnessing literature. Classwork integrates didactic and experiential methodologies to develop a heightened awareness of self and others and build a practical set of narrative competencies.

CPLS GU4325,Abolition Medicine: Medical Racisms and,"In 1935, WEB Dubois wrote about abolition democracy: an idea based not only on breaking down unjust systems, but on building up new, antiracist social structures. Scholar activists like Angela Davis, Ruth Gilmore and Mariame Kaba have long contended that the abolition of slavery was but one first step in ongoing abolitionist practices dismantling racialized systems of policing, surveillance and incarceration. The possibilities of prison and police abolition have recently come into the mainstream national consciousness during the 2020 resurgence of nationwide Black Lives Matters (BLM) protests. As we collectively imagine what nonpunitive and supportive community reinvestment in employment, education, childcare, mental health, and housing might look like, medicine must be a part of these conversations. Indeed, if racist violence is a public health emergency, and we are trying to bring forth a “public health approach to public safety” – what are medicine’s responsibilities to these social and institutional reinventions?
  
Medicine has a long and fraught history of racial violence. It was, after all, medicine and pseudoscientific inquiry that helped establish what we know as the racial categorizations of today: ways of separating human beings based on things like skin color and hair texture that were used (and often continue to be used) to justify the enslavement, exclusion, or genocide of one group of people by another. Additionally, the history of the professionalization of U.S. medicine, through the formation of medical schools and professional organizations as well as and the certification of trained physicians, is a history of exclusion, with a solidification of the identity of “physician” around upper middle class white masculinity. Indeed, the 1910 Flexner Report, whose aim was to make consistent training across the country’s medical schools, was explicit in its racism. From practices of eugenic sterilization, to histories of experimentation upon bodies of color, medicine is unfortunately built upon racist, sexist and able-ist practices.
  
This course is built on the premise that a socially just practice of medicine is a bioethical imperative. Such a practice cannot be achieved, however, without examining medicine’s histories of racism, as well as learning from and building upon histories of anti-racist health practice. The first half of the semester will be dedicated to learning about histories of medical racism: from eugenics and racist experiment",Sayantani T Dasgupta,12:10pm,2:00pm,10323,,W4325-20253-001,Abolition Medicine,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLS/W4325-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253CPLS4325W001,SEMINAR

Rather than presenting a reductionist, linear narrative that uncritically traces the triumphs of Western technological innovations and genius individuals, this course instead explores media as organizational and management devices that produce particular kinds of knowledge and power, including by influencing our understanding of social issues and social justice.
  
 We will explore how media, as vehicles of knowledge production, are intimately connected to meaning-making, policing, and exclusion practices. At the same time, media can be repurposed as instruments for liberation struggles and emancipatory imaginaries of all kinds. Throughout the course, we will learn about these themes both through the lens of a critical history of the present, emphasizing the long-standing value struggles that underpin media environments and inform practices of re-mediation and cultural production, and also through being in conversation with recent trends in media studies and contemporary social issues.",Irina Kalinka,2:10pm,4:00pm,13338,,W4399-20253-001,Intro Media Cultural Stud,"Comparative Literature and Society, Institute for",CPLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLS/W4399-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253CPLS4399W001,SEMINAR

CPLT BC2000,Introduction to Comparative Literature,"This course introduces students to the study of comparative literature.  For any student interested  in what it means to live in a multi-lingual world with rich and diverse forms and traditions of literary, artistic, and philosophical expression, this course serves to cultivate lifelong skills and habits of attentivenes that will prepare you to navigate the world as engaged, critical-thinking cosmopolitan citizens.  For students who would like to major in Comparative Literature and Translation Studies at Barnard, this course serves as the gateway course for the program.  For students who wish to minor in Translation Studies, this course serves as an elective. The course is designed to introduce you to methods and topics in the study of literature across national, linguistic, and cultural boundaries, across historical periods, and in relation to other arts and disciplines.  Readings are selected and juxtaposed in units designed to give you cumulative practice in doing comparative criticism and to foster thereby deepening reflection on underlying historical, philosophical, historiographical, and methodological issues.  We will study works of narrative and lyric poetry, novels, short stories, and film and also works of philosophy, political theory, linguistics, and psychoanalysis.  We will read texts of literary criticism, literary theory, and translation theory.  Topics include: the role of language and literature in different cultures and historical periods, the relationship between genres, the circulation of literary forms, literature and translation, postcoloniality, gender and sexual difference, and the relationship of literature to other arts.  By engaging with the particular combinations of texts in the course, students will learn how to read closely and deeply and make well-substantiated critical connections between textual and cultural phenomena that may yield new, original, and surprising insights. Students in this course typically bring with them a range of languages, but not everyone has proficiency in the same languages.  Common readings will be in English translation, but students capable of reading the texts in the original languages should feel free to do so.  You will be given the opportunity to work with the texts in the original languages in assignments of interpretive and translation criticism.",Emily Sun,11:40am,12:55pm,00257,,X2000-20253-001,INTRO TO COMP LIT,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X2000-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253CPLT2000X001,LECTURE
CPLT BC2110,Introduction to Translation Studies,"This course will introduce students to the principal ways in which translation has been practiced and theorized in the Western tradition. We will consider, cultural, literary and philosophical theories of translation, as well as the role of translation and translators in today's globalized world. Topics covered will include: translation in the context of postcolonialism, globalization and immigration; the translation of children’s literature; subbing and dubbing in film and television, including fansubbing; translation and ecology; translation and justice; machine translation; linguistic rights; debates about mono- versus plurilingualism. We will also consider, less extensively, the place of interpreting (i.e. oral translation primarily in legal and medical settings). Specialists from the New York area will come to speak about current needs and challenges in the field of community interpreting. On the literary level, we will examine the role played by foreign languages (and translation) in the creative process of contemporary writers. We will read a number of “language memoirs,” narratives that recount the authors’ complex and sometimes agonized relation to acquiring a second language (Eva Hoffman, Xiaolu Guo, Alice Kaplan et al). For one of the assignments you will write the beginning of your own language history. We will also read and study in depth Brian Friel’s play 
Translations
. This play is about the replacement of Irish (Gaelic) place names with English names as a result of an ordnance survey in the early 18th century. The course aims to help students improve their translation skills by translating (mostly literature) from your second language (your L2, as the linguists call it) into English, by critically assessing published translations, and by evaluating each other’s' translations-in-progress (including one of the professor's). There will be a number of guest lecturers (translators, editors, writers, interpreters, etc).

CPLT BC3025,"Documents of Urgency: Reading Walsh, Are","In this course, we will consider three mid-20th-Century thinkers who responded to grave injustices of their day through writing: Rodolfo Walsh, Hannah Arendt, and James Baldwin. Taking three texts by these authors as a point of comparison and departure—
Operation Massacre 
(1957), 
Eichmann in Jerusalem 
(1963), and 
The Fire Next Time 
(1963)—we will explore the urgency of each text and think together about how these works catch the consciences of their readers. In tandem, we will look at related documentary films—
Operación Masacre 
(1973), 
The Specialist 
(1999), and 
I Am Not Your Negro 
(2016), among others—to enrich our understanding of these writers’ interventions, with a specific eye to their capacity for holding hope and despair together in their work. We will study the narrative techniques each writer uses to depict the suffering they are confronting while also leaving room for the possibility of improved conditions. In each case, we will also read the work of each writer in different genres—poetry and philosophy for Arendt, fiction for Walsh and Baldwin—and think together about the forms and rhetorical functions of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, in these contexts, as well as the specific affordances of literature as a medium (compared, say, to film). As a final, capstone assignment, students will have the choice of either writing a research paper on one or at most two of the authors/central works, or crafting their own work of long-form cultural criticism in response to a social issue of their choice.",Faculty,12:10pm,2:00pm,00908,,X3025-20253-001,DOCUMENTS OF URGENCY,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3025-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20253CPLT3025X001,SEMINAR

Nazism did not harbor ideologies without benefits for the allied nations. Thus, the dynamic performance of transnationalism among the ""brothers in arms"" will be included as well, in order to elucidate how works of art crossing into the Third Reich were reimagined, sometimes in ways challenging to the presumed values of the state stage.

CPLT BC3144,Stories and Storytelling: Attending to N,"What is it to attend to narrative? Attending has its etymological roots in Latin, 
attendere
, to stretch (one’s mind) 
towards
, to get closer, which implies a gap between one’s mind and whatever it is one is attending to. 
Attendre
 in French means to wait, to expect, another gesture towards space between one’s mind and whatever one is waiting for or expecting. What happens in that space? What is it to attend? Is it to slow down and mind the gap? Or is it to 
pay 
or 
lend 
attention, as the phrase appears in multiple languages, as though the space is a debt that we or our minds owe? What does it look like to pay attention to narrative and stories?
  
This course offers an introduction to forms and functions of narrative with focus on three modes: perception, reflection, and memory. What distinguishes the texts we will study is how they themselves foreground and reflect on how stories are told and so perform the task of teaching us how to analyze them. Topics include the writing of the self; the nature of memory; the experience of time; the relationship between fact, fantasy, and fiction; and the search for truth. While we will cover a range of scripture, poetry, novels, essays, plays, comics, and hybrid literary forms, the demand of you as readers will be the same: lend your close attention to these works and give yourself time to reflect on them.",Faculty,1:10pm,2:25pm,00829,,X3144-20253-001,STORIES & STORYTELLING: N,Comparative Literature and Society @Barnard,CPLT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CPLT/X3144-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253CPLT3144X001,LECTURE

CSER GR5000,INTRO TO AMERICAN STUDIES,"This course explores the set of possibilities presented by American Studies as a comparative field of study. We begin with a brief overview of the history of the field, and then we’ll focus primarily on the range of modes in which its interdisciplinary work has been undertaken (literary, historical, legal, digital, etc.). The idea here is not to arrive a comprehensive picture of American Studies, but to think about the many ways people have produced knowledge under its aegis. We will also focus on work by Columbia faculty, and sessions of the course are built around visits by faculty in the field to Columbia’s University Seminar in American Studies. Our guiding questions include: How does one do research in a multimedia, “cultural” environment? How does one situate oneself as an “intellectual” or “critic” in relation to one’s object of study? How does one write about different media/genres? How does one incorporate different methodologies into one research project?",Matthew Sandler,4:10pm,6:00pm,10185,,G5000-20253-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/G5000-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20253CSER5000G001,SEMINAR
CSER GU4400,Histories and Representations of the Bro,"The history of the Bronx is a history of the struggles, political coalitions, and creative contributions of the dispossessed. To tell the story of the Bronx is to tell the story of how historically marginalized communities have survived and made a home in environments forsaken by the state. And yet, in the popular imagination, the Bronx often circulates simply as a symbol of urban abjection, as the necessary foil against which prosperous urban spaces define themselves. Many of these ""Bronx tales"" invariably relegate the borough both materially and imaginatively to the past—infused with either white ethnic nostalgia of a lost Bronx innocence or with battle-scar bravado won on its mean streets. This interdisciplinary course invites students to interrogate these long-standing narratives about the Bronx through a critical study of the borough’s rich history and enduring cultural, political, and artistic traditions during the past century. This course explores a variety of movements and artifacts that have been central to the making of the Bronx such as: efforts to establish affordable housing, public art-making, the literary tradition of Bronx coming-of-age stories, grassroots organizing for immigrant rights, struggles against gentrification and environmental racism, and the inter-ethnic collaborations that led to the emergence of hip hop. Students will have the opportunity to embark on field trips and will undertake a wide array of methods including oral histories, performance analysis, archival research, ethnography, mapping, as well as opportunities to engage in creative art-making. By the end of the semester, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the central role that Bronx communities have played in the making of modern New York City.",,10:10am,12:00pm,10184,,W4400-20253-001,Histories & Rep of the Br,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/W4400-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253CSER4400W001,SEMINAR

This course will analyze the domino effect of the Patriot Act, the Absconder Initiative, Special Registration, the Real I.D. Act, border security including the building of the 700-mile fence along the U.S./Mexico border, Secured Communities Act-that requires the cooperation of state and local authorities in immigration enforcement, the challenge to birthright citizenship, and now the congressional hearings on Islamic radicalization.

How do war and conflict impact and complicate belonging and influence the movement of people across borders and boundaries? With these questions in mind, this course examines the dynamics of war and its aftermath through a complex intersectional lens of gender, race, sexuality, class, religion, and nation. We will also consider how war and conflict lead to forced migration. Most regions of the world are currently or have been, immersed in war and conflict. In order to better understand how and why wars are fomented and conflicts occur, we will examine U.S. wars as well as transnational conflicts and perspectives, while considering how the construction of “the enemy” is gendered and racialized. We will utilize readings from various fields of study to examine historical processes of war, conflict, and displacement. We will combine diverse texts and theoretical engagements, lectures, documentary films, discussions, and class-based activities to interrogate war and notions of subjectivity, alterity, and belonging across time, place, and space.",Bahia Munem,12:10pm,2:00pm,10176,,W3522-20253-001,,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/W3522-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253CSER3522W001,SEMINAR
CSER UN3523,INTRODUCTION TO LATINX STUDIES,"In the US, Latinxs are often treated in quantitative terms—as checkmarks on census forms, or as
 data points in demographic surveys. However, Latinxs have always been more than mere numbers:
 while some have stayed rooted in traditional homelands, and while others have migrated through
 far-flung diasporas, all have drawn on and developed distinctive ways of imagining and inhabiting
 the Americas. In this course, we will explore a wide range of these Latinx lifeways. Through readings
 in the humanities and social sciences, we will learn how Latinxs have survived amidst and against
 settler colonialism and racial capitalism. Meanwhile, through the study of literature and art, we will
 see how Latinxs have resisted and/or reinforced these social systems. With our interdisciplinary and
 intersectional approach, we will determine why Latinidad has manifested differently in colonial
 territories (especially Puerto Rico), regional communities (especially the US–Mexico borderlands),
 and transnational diasporas (of Cubans, of Dominicans, and of a variety of Central Americans). At
 the same time, we will understand how Latinxs have struggled with shared issues, such as (anti-)
 Blackness and (anti-)Indigeneity, gender and sexuality, citizenship and (il)legality, and economic and
 environmental (in)justice. During the semester, we will practice Latinx studies both collectively and
  
individually: to enrich our in-class discussions, each student will complete a reading journal, a five-

It has several aims and goals. First, the course introduces students to a variety of ways of thinking about knowledge as well as to specific ways of knowing and making arguments key to humanistic and social science fields. Second, this seminar asks students to think critically about the approaches they employ in pursuing their research. The course will culminate in a semester project, not a fully executed research project, but rather an 8-10 page proposal for research that will articulate a question, provide basic background on the context that this question is situated in, sketch preliminary directions and plot out a detailed methodological plan for answering this question. Students will be strongly encouraged to think of this proposal as related to their thesis or senior project.

What if this were true because it is a space for hybrid construction of identity that directly reflects a mixture of traditions across racial lines in Latin America? This course will investigate Latin musics transgression of binary views of race in Anglo-American society, even as it directly affects the development of pop music in America. From New Orleans jazz to Texas corridos, salsa, rock, and reggaeton, Latin music acts as both as a soundtrack and a structural blueprint for the 21st centurys multicultural experiment. There will be a strong focus on studying Latin musics political economy, and investigating the story it tells about migration and globalization.",Edward Morales,2:10pm,4:00pm,10181,,W3926-20253-001,LATIN MUSIC AND IDENITY,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/W3926-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20253CSER3926W001,SEMINAR

CSER UN3935,HIST OF THE US-MEXIC0 BORDER,"Beginning in the 1980s, border crossing became an academic rage in the humanities and the social sciences. This was a consequence of globalization, an historical process that reconfigured the boundaries between economy, society, and culture; and it was also a primary theme of post-modernist aesthetics, which celebrated playful borrowing of multiple and diverse historical references. Within that frame, interest in the US-Mexican border shifted dramatically. Since that border is the longest and most intensively crossed boundary between a rich and a poor country, it became a paradigmatic point of reference. Places like Tijuana or El Paso, with their rather seedy reputation, had until then been of interest principally to local residents, but they now became exemplars of post-modern “hybridity,” and were meant to inspire the kind of transnational scholarship that is required in today’s world. Indeed, the border itself became a metaphor, a movable imaginary boundary that marks ethnic and racial distinction in American and Mexican cities. This course is an introduction to the historical formation of the US-Mexican border.",Claudio Lomnitz,2:10pm,4:00pm,10183,,W3935-20253-001,HIST OF THE US-MEXIC0 BOR,"Ethnicity and Race, Center for",CSER,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Lomnitz,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/CSER/W3935-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253CSER3935W001,SEMINAR

DNCE BC3331,NOW. Moving in the Moment: An Introducti,"There are as many reasons to improvise as there are cultures. People from all over the world have turned to improvised dance for personal, social, and political reasons. Improvisation is equally as useful in developing self-expression as it is in forming community and mutual understanding. It can be a vehicle for discovering more about our world by heightening our senses and awareness. It can be a mind-puzzle, as practitioners devise creative constraints for the purposes of producing structure and clarity. Whatever the reason for improvising, all practitioners share a sense of questioning and curiosity. This course will cover five units of study, each one aimed at exploring a different function of improvisation: self- expression; music and space; our bodies and environment; structure and cognition; and community-building. Learning in the classroom will rely on reading texts and viewing images and videos, written work, peer-to-peer learning and self-directed inquiry. In the studio, students will be given different exercises and prompts to explore and refine. By the end of the semester students will understand how improvisation occurs and how it differs from codified or prescriptive work, and why different people choose to improvise. They will also be able to develop and perform their own improvisatory work, drawing from the skills learned over the semester.",Caroline Fermin,1:10pm,2:25pm,00576,,X3331-20253-001,Intro to Dance Improvisat,Dance @Barnard,DNCE,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/DNCE/X3331-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253DNCE3331X001,LECTURE

We review how Indian classical dance aligns with the oldest of performance texts, and with lively discourses (rasa as a performance aesthetic, Orientalism, nationalism, global recirculations) through the ages, not only in India but also in Europe, Britain and America. Throughout the course, we ask:- How is culture embodied? How do historical texts configure dance today? How might they affect our thinking on mind-body, practice-theory, and traditional-contemporary divides? How does bodily patterning influence the ways that we experience our surroundings and vice versa? Can cultural imaginaries instigate action? How is gender is performed?

EAAS BC3840,Beyond the Great Wall: Nomadic Empires a,"Since Antiquity, the Great Wall has become both a geographical and socio-cultural fault line between steppe nomads and the Chinese. More than a physical and territorial boundary, the Great Wall also functions as a powerful conceptual metaphor, symbolizing the gap between insiders and outsiders. The intellectual discourses of “frontier” and “border” embodied by the Wall have kept alive well into modern China.
 The course follows a broadly chronological order from the Xiongnu Empire through the Mongols to modern times. Additionally, it incorporates thematic explorations such as nomadic culture, Sinitic concepts of unity, ethno-cultural diversity, multi-linguistic empires, and so on. We will make use of Chinese literature and art on the one hand, and primary sources from Central Asia on the other, to develop a comprehensive and comparative understanding of both sides of the Great Wall. As such, we ask how the nomads served as agents of change in Eurasian and even world history, and in turn, we problematize some enduring challenges faced by the Chinese state from the past to the present.
 Listed as a Global Core, this course assumes no background of Chinese or Central Asian language and literature. Students are expected to engage thoughtfully and critically with course materials, including primary sources translated into English and secondary scholarship. Readings will include classical texts from Sinitic culture as well as diverse literary sources on nomadic peoples, such as The Secret History of the Mongols and travelogues by Marco Polo. These primary texts will be examined alongside secondary scholarship, with visual and material objects integrated to complement the written texts.",Lili Xia,2:10pm,4:00pm,00977,,X3840-20253-003,Beyond the Great Wall: No,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,EAAS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/X3840-20253-003/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20253EAAS3840X003,SEMINAR

Building off of the discussion of the colonial medical complex, the seminar will conclude with a consideration of the relations between the colonial modern and postcolonial developmentalism.",Theodore Hughes,4:10pm,6:00pm,10925,,G8222-20253-001,Korean Cultural Studies,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/G8222-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253EAAS8222G001,SEMINAR
EAAS GR8992,CHINESE MEDIA CULTURES,"What is media and mediation? How do aesthetics, techniques and technologies of media shape perception, experience, and politics in our societies? And how have various forms of media and mediation been conceptualized and practiced in the Chinese-language environment? This graduate seminar examines critical issues in historical and contemporary Chinese media cultures, and guides students in a broad survey of primary texts, theoretical readings, and research methods that place Chinese media cultures in historical, comparative and interdisciplinary perspectives. We discuss a variety of media forms, including paintings and graphic arts, photography and cinema, soundscapes and the built environment, and television and digital media. The class covers a time span from mid-19 th  century to the present, and makes use of the rich holdings at the Starr East Asian Library for historical research and media archaeology.

EAAS GU4226,"GENDER,CLASS,REAL ESTATE-CHINA","This is a seminar for advanced undergraduates and master’s degree students, which explores the socioeconomic consequences of China’s development of a boom, urban residential real-estate market since the privatization of housing at the end of the 1990s. We will use the intersecting lenses of gender/sexuality, class and race/ethnicity to analyze the dramatic new inequalities created in arguably the largest and fastest accumulation of residential-real estate wealth in history. We will examine topics such as how skyrocketing home prices and state-led urbanization have created winners and losers based on gender, sexuality, class, race/ethnicity and location (hukou), as China strives to transform from a predominantly rural population to one that is 60 percent urban by 2020. We explore the vastly divergent effects of urban real-estate development on Chinese citizens, from the most marginaliz4d communities in remote regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to hyper-wealthy investors in Manhattan. Although this course has no formal prerequisites, it assumes some basic knowledge of Chinese history. If you have never taken a course on China before, please ask me for guidance on whether or not this class is suitable for you.

Through diverse texts, including official chronicles, didactic texts, memoirs, and (auto)biographies, students will analyze how individuals and institutions used writing to assert authority, express dissent, and document their lives.",Jungwon Kim,4:10pm,6:00pm,12920,,W4310-20253-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/W4310-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253EAAS4310W001,SEMINAR
EAAS GU4370,Literati Culture in Pre-Modern China,"Premodern Chinese literati have long been regarded as active historical agents who shaped “This Culture of Ours”—a metonym for civilization in the premodern Sinitic context—while they also fed from, partook in, and influenced popular and foreign cultures. Besides “literary writings” like poetry and prose, literati also engaged in calligraphy, painting, and antiquarianism under the umbrella term of “literary or cultural arts.” In turn, the creation and appreciation of artwork were intrinsic to the aesthetic life of literati community and further established their self-identity. At the same time, social exclusivity, (self-)doubt and identity crises, along with the looming threat of cultural decline, have continually haunted this literati community throughout the ages.
  
Covering the long trajectory of imperial China, this course reveals the birth and development of literati culture. In particular, we take an interdisciplinary approach, introducing intellectual and poetic discourses, socio-historical contexts, literary criticism, visual and material culture, to envision a “common ground” for their civil world. Textual, visual sources plus material objects are meant to have conversations with each other in this course. Important issues include historical transformations of the elite class, cultural geography in different eras, materiality and visuality of elite calligraphy and painting, literati self-expression through aesthetic practice, the roles of the court and literati in producing and preserving art, as well as other relevant issues such as gender studies, vernacular literature, and commodity society.
  
This course is cross-listed in AMEC and CPLT. For undergraduates, no background in Chinese language is required in this course, and all reading materials—either translation of primary sources or secondary scholarship—are accessible in English.",Lili Xia,2:10pm,4:00pm,00860,,W4370-20253-001,Literati Cult.

EAAS GU4840,CHINA AND POLITICS OF DESIRE,"A recent American newspaper headline announced that China has become “the most materialistic country the world.” Globally circulating narratives often interpret Chinese consumers’ demand for commodities as an attempt to fill a void left by the absence of the Maoist state, traditional religious life, and Western-style democracy. But things aren’t as simple as they appear. This course explores the intertwined questions of “Chinese” desire and the desire for China. Avoiding reductionist understandings of desire as either a universal natural human attribute or a particular Chinese cultural trait, we will track the production and management of desire within a complex global field. Drawing on ethnographies, films, short stories, and psychoanalytic and postcolonial theory, this course will explore the shifting figure of desire across the Maoist and post-Maoist eras by examining how academics, government officials, intellectuals, and artists have represented Chinese needs, wants and fantasies. From state leaders’ attempts to improve the “quality” of the country’s population to citizens’ dreams of home ownership, from sexualized desire to hunger for food, drugs and other commodities, we will attend to the continuities and disjunctures of recent Chinese history by tracking how desire in China has been conceptualized and refracted through local and global encounters.",Nicholas A Bartlett,10:10am,12:00pm,00390,,W4840-20253-001,,Asian and Middle East @Barnard,EAAS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/W4840-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253EAAS4840W001,SEMINAR
EAAS UN3215,KOREAN LITERATURE & FILM,"This course traces the history of Korean cinema and literature from the 1930s to the early 2000s. Particular attention is given to colonialism, national division, war, gender relations, authoritarianism, urbanization, consumer culture, and diaspora. What kinds of familial, social, economic, and political relations do these films and literary works envision? We will link films and literary texts to their historical context, noting how representations of people, places, and ideas have changed over time—from colonialism, through poverty and malaise in the aftermath of the Korean War, to North Korea’s continuing search for autonomy in the world system and South Korea’s current position as global economic power and maker of the “Korean Wave ”",Theodore Hughes,4:10pm,6:00pm,10924,,V3215-20253-001,,East Asian Languages and Cultures,EAAS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EAAS/V3215-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253EAAS3215V001,LECTURE
EAAS UN3322,EAST ASIAN CINEMA,"This course introduces students to major works, genres and waves of East Asian cinema from the Silent era to the present, including films from Japan, Korea, Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. How has cinema participated in East Asian societies’ distinct and shared experiences of industrial modernity, imperialism and (post)colonialism? How has cinema engaged with questions of class, gender, ethnic and language politics? In what ways has cinema facilitated transnational circulations and mobilizations of peoples and ideas, and how has it interacted with other art forms, such as theatre, painting, photography and music? In this class, we answer these questions by studying cinemas across the region sideby- side, understanding cinema as deeply embedded in the region’s intertwining political, social and cultural histories and circulations of people and ideas. We cover a variety of genres such as melodrama, comedy, historical epic, sci-fi, martial arts and action, and prominent film auteurs such as Yasujir? Ozu, Akira Kurosawa, Yu Hy?nmok, Chen Kaige, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Ann Hui. As cinema is, among other things, a creative practice, in this course, students will be given opportunities to respond to films analytically and creatively, through writing as well as creative visual projects.

ECON GU4720,Empirical Macroeconomics and Finance,"This course develops empirical methods to investigate key questions in macroeconomics and finance, and discusses the existing empirical evidence on those questions. While models developed in macroeconomics and finance provide theoretical frameworks for understanding economic fluctuations, long-run growth, and policy interventions, empirical work is crucial for testing these models and informing policy decisions. The course will examine key macroeconomics/finance questions—such as the sources of short-run fluctuations, the determinants of long-run growth, or the role of financial markets in business cycles—through the lens of modern empirical techniques. We will put a special emphasis on implications for the design of economic policy. For instance, we will consider what the empirical evidence tells us on questions such as: can stimulus checks boost consumer spending? does monetary policy affect investment? should governments invest in R&D?  Special attention will be given to recent advances in identification strategies, including high-frequency event studies, differences-in-differences approaches, and instrumental variables tailored to macroeconomic settings. By integrating empirical evidence with theoretical insights, the course aims to equip students with the tools to critically assess macroeconomic policy and contribute to ongoing debates in the field.",Noemie Pinardon-Touati,4:10pm,5:25pm,12913,,W4720-20253-001,Empirical Macroecon & Fin,Economics,ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/W4720-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253ECON4720W001,LECTURE
ECON GU4840,BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,"Prerequisites: ECON UN3211 and ECON UN3213 Within economics, the standard model of behavior is that of a perfectly rational, self interested utility maximizer with unlimited cognitive resources.

Understanding these behaviors, and their implications, is one of the most exciting areas of current economic inquiry. The aim of this course is to provide a grounding in the main areas of study within behavioral economics, including temptation and self control, fairness and reciprocity, reference dependence, bounded rationality and choice under risk and uncertainty. For each area we will study three things: 1. The evidence that indicates that the standard economic model is missing some important behavior 2. The models that have been developed to capture these behaviors 3. Applications of these models to (for example) finance, labor and development economics As well as the standard lectures, homework assignments, exams and so on, you will be asked to participate in economic experiments, the data from which will be used to illustrate some of the principals in the course. There will also be a certain small degree of classroom ‘flipping’, with a portion of many lectures given over to group problem solving. Finally, an integral part of the course will be a research proposal that you must complete by the end of the course, outlining a novel piece of research that you would be interested in doing.",Mark Dean,11:40am,12:55pm,12150,,W4840-20253-001,,Economics,ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/W4840-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,"ECON UN3211

Students must have a minimum GPA of 3.7 in all required major courses, including calculus and statistics, prior to enrollment. The honors thesis seminar is a year-long course, beginning in the fall semester and ending in the spring semester. Students who have been approved to enter the workshop will be registered for both semesters by the department during the first two weeks of classes; 3 points are earned per semester. This workshop may only be taken by students applying for departmental honors, and it also fulfills the economics seminar requirement for the economics major and all joint majors. Students must see the director during mid-semester registration in the spring to discuss their proposed thesis topic, at which time they will be matched with appropriate faculty who will act as their thesis adviser. Students will meet their adviser over the course of the year at mutually agreed upon times. A rough draft of the thesis will be due during the first week of February in the spring semester, and the final draft will be due three weeks before the last day of classes. Please note that for those joint majors that require two seminars, one in economics and one in the other discipline (i.e. Political Science), the economics senior honors thesis seminar only fulfills the economics seminar requirement.",Lena Edlund,4:10pm,6:00pm,12189,,W4999-20253-001,SENIOR HONORS THESIS WORK,Economics,ECON,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ECON/W4999-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

EDUC BC3033,"Ethnographies of Youth Confinement, Cons","Being young can often mean being (or feeling) powerless, particularly within the large
 institutions that structure youth’s lives. Couple this with experiences of marginalization due to
 race, class, gender, or other social identities, and young people may experience profound
 constraints in their choices or pathways. At the same time, youth – both individually and in
 groups – often develop strategies to resist these sources of literal and figurative confinement to
 seek out dignity, joy, and justice. Using sociological and ethnographic texts as our foundation,
 this course will explore the way experiences of confinement and constraint show up in the lives
 of young people, particularly as they move through educational institutions – and how youth
 work to resist those forms of subordination.
  
 In the first half of the semester, we will focus on policing and prisons and examine the ways
 schools play a role in funneling youth into different forms of confinement. In the second half of
 the semester, we will investigate college and college preparatory contexts in an effort to
 understand the ways they may constrain opportunities by creating or foreclosing particular
 pathways for students’ futures. Throughout the semester, we will emphasize the role of socially
 constructed identity categories – race, gender, class, in particular, as well as the category of
 youth itself – in these processes of confinement and constraint. We will also highlight youth and
 community practices of resistance against these social and institutional forces. Along the way,
 we will consider (and practice) the affordances and limitations of ethnography as a mode of
 social research for studying confinement, constraint, and practices of resistance in educational
 contexts.
  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
 Through this course, students will:
  
● Use a range of sociological, ethnographic, and multimodal texts to analyze youth’s
 experiences of confinement, constraint, and resistance (expansively defined) and the
 ways they play out in different institutional, educational, and social contexts.
 ● Explore the methodological approach of ethnography – its affordances, challenges, and
 some of the major dilemmas in the field – and practice it by conducting a series of
 scaffolded ethnographic projects.
 ● Write for multiple purposes, including exploratory and dialogic writing shared with peers",Nora M Gross,12:10pm,2:00pm,00444,,X3033-20253-001,Youth Constraint & Resist,Education @Barnard,EDUC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3033-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20253EDUC3033X001,SEMINAR

EDUC BC3040,"MIGRATION, GLOBALIZATION, AND EDUCATION","Globalization and mass migration are reconfiguring the modern world and reshaping the contours of nation-states. New technologies that facilitate the movement of information, goods and people across borders have made it easier for people to remain culturally, politically, economically and socially connected to the places from which they migrated. This seminar focuses on the experiences of the youngest members of these global migration patterns—children and youth—and asks: What do these global flows mean for educating young people to be members of the multiple communities to which they belong?
  
This seminar will explore the following questions: What is globalization and why is it leading to new patterns of migration? How do children and youth experience ruptures and continuities across contexts of migration? How do language policies affect young people’s capacity to be educated in a new land? What does it mean to forge a sense of belonging and citizenship in a “globalized” world, and how does this challenge our models of national citizenship? How are the processes by which young people are incorporated into their new country entwined with structures of race, class, and gender? Drawing on fiction, autobiography, and anthropological and sociological research this class will explore these questions from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.",Orubba Almansouri,10:10am,12:00pm,00419,,X3040-20253-001,"MIGRATION, GLOBALIZATION,",Education @Barnard,EDUC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3040-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20253EDUC3040X001,SEMINAR
EDUC BC3043,"Making Change: Activism, Social Movement","Summer and 
Semester version:
  
Making Change: Activism, Social Movements and Education will look at the ways people power has pushed for change in the United States educational landscape. We will study historical and current social political education movements to answer questions such as: What does education/teacher activism look like? Who engages in educational social activism, and why? What do different models for organizing look like, past to present? We will learn from the examples of the Freedom Schools, the Chicago Teachers Union, the Tucson Unified School District fight for ethnics studies, BLM at Schools, Teacher Activist Groups and more. We will engage in readings, watch documentaries and hear from education activist guest lecturers.
  
Learning Outcomes: 
  
  
You will explore the historical relationships between and across social movements in education and its social contexts. 
  
You will reflect on major educational justice movements from across the country and analyze its impact and importance. 
  
You will evaluate the changing role of education and schools in our society and propose actions that could be taken to improve education and schools in the future.",Fawziah Qadir,12:10pm,2:00pm,00420,,X3043-20253-001,Activism and Education,Education @Barnard,EDUC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3043-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253EDUC3043X001,SEMINAR

EDUC BC3051,SEMINAR URBAN EDUCATION,"This seminar serves as the capstone course for students pursuing the Education Studies minor/special concentration or the Urban Studies major/concentration with an Urban Education Specialization. The Seminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-cultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time, a range of social actors have intervened in the “problem” of urban education, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools. Others have disputed this “problem” focused approach, arguing that policy makers, teachers, and researchers should start from the strengths and capacities located in urban communities. Despite decades of wide ranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide their students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban Education investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course questions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity in urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of assets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this history and context, what would effective reform in a global city like NYC look like? Students will engage these questions not only through course readings and seminar discussions, but through a 40-hour field placement in a New York City public school classroom, extra-curricular program, or other education based site.",Rachel Throop,12:10pm,2:00pm,00425,,X3051-20253-001,SEMINAR IN URBAN EDUCATION,Education @Barnard,EDUC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EDUC/X3051-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20253EDUC3051X001,SEMINAR

This class examines the basic principles of environmental science using current local and global environmental news as case studies. Issues covered are climate change, invasive species, water resources, sustainability, etc. A major goal is for students to understand the science behind environmental issues. Readings from the scientific literature, various newspaper articles, magazines and an online textbook are carefully coordinated with the topics. Because of our location, the lab curriculum features studies of the Hudson River and its forested shorelines. The lab is closely paired with the lecture and features hands-on and inquiry-based lab and field studies of statistics, data presentation, writing in the format of a scientific paper, data collection (on land and on the Hudson River), water chemistry, microbiology, microscopic and macroscopic life in the river, birds and plants in Riverside Park, biodiversity on a green roof, local geology, topographical maps, compass use, and museum studies.

EHSC P8317,Frameworks for Environmental Health Poli,"How should society regulate environmental health risks? Some argue that the health of the citizenry is paramount, and that the role of government should be to protect against any possibility of harm. Others back an approach based on a full accounting of the benefits and costs of environmental protection. And in the current political environment, ideological positions sometimes eclipse analysis. These debates occur against a backdrop of uncertainty about the health risks posed by specific environmental insults. In spite of all this ambiguity and complexity, policy happens: congress makes laws, regulatory agencies enforce the law, and most polluters comply.
In this class we will study several frameworks for thinking about these questions. Environmental economics, in the form of benefit-cost analyses, is the primary framing used by the US Federal Government. We will explore its conceptual foundations and its applications in the US regulatory context. In our discussions of the sociology of science perspective, we will examine how environmental health scientists interact with the policy process, and think through how such interactions might be improved. The third perspective is decision theory, and in particular, choice under uncertainty. We will consider the basic analytics of expected value, and some permutations and applications that are germane to the environmental health policy domain. In addition to these conceptual frameworks, we will analyze and interpret cases drawn from recent experiences with environmental health regulation in the United States. 
This course is designed to introduce Mailman students to core frameworks for thinking about environmental health policy.

EHSC P8325,"Risk Assessment, Communication, and Mana","Risk Assessment is the process of correlating the amount of exposure (to a chemical, activity, or situation) with expected harm. This Department core course is primarily concerned with toxic substances to which humans are exposed through their environments, in the context of whether and how exposure to such toxicants should be controlled: risk assessment. Toxicological and epidemiological principles are used primarily to provide (uncertain) quantitative estimates of the harm associated with a given level of exposure: dose-response. Using a dose-response relationship necessitates quantifying exposure, an uncertain endeavor that relies on understanding human physiology and behavior. The quantitative estimates of harm from anthropogenic activity that risk assessment gives are just the starting point for the challenge of risk management: What do we do now?"" The resulting decisions are influenced by both economic factors (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) and psychological factors (e.g., risk perception).""",Michael P Musso,5:30pm,8:20pm,14369,,P8325-20253-001,"RISK, ASSESSMENT, COMM/MG",Environmental Health Sciences,EHSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/EHSC/P8325-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

ENGL BC1068,True Crime,"Over the centuries, readers have been drawn to accounts of “true” crime—violent narratives involving real people and real events. And yet, as with any literary object, the notion of “truth” is always unstable—stories and their tellings are always shaped by the motivations, values, and choices of those who tell them, often with an eye toward the audience that will consume them. Whether constructed in order to moralize, to enforce or critique social or political ideologies, or purely to sell copies, “true
 crime” is a literary genre that reveals attitudes about gender, race, and class; that illustrates—and sometimes calls into question—cultural norms and mores; that calls on readers to reflect on their own morbid curiosity and assumptions and fears. In this class we will engage with a diverse selection of literary texts—spanning from the Middle Ages to the present day and from a range of genres, including pamphlets, plays, novels, and more—as well as contemporary films, a tv series, and a
 podcast. Through close reading and critical analysis, we will examine the evolution of the “true crime” genre and the cultural and societal contexts that shape the portrayal of crime for popular consumption. We will explore the ways in which texts and authors sensationalize, moralize, and convey the complexities of crime. We will analyze point of view: who’s telling the story, whom we sympathize with, and what insights we get into the minds of those committing crimes as well as those who fall prey to them. We will consider justice and policing— the role played by the law and its enforcers in shaping narratives about crime and punishment, right and wrong. Finally, we will reflect on the ethical implications of representing real-life crimes in literature, and how “true crime” narratives shape social perceptions, fears, prejudices, and notions of justice and morality.",Penelope Usher,11:40am,12:55pm,00020,,X1068-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1068-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ENGL1068X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC1295,GRAPHIC AUTOBIOGRAPHIES AND BIOGRAPHIES,"Autobiographical and biographical graphic narratives are perhaps the best known and most widely read graphic literary texts. Their combination of word and hand-drawn images afford creators a wide variety of formal and stylistic devices for depicting emergent identity, historical experience, trauma, memory and post-memory, among other themes. At the same time, the inherent subjectivity of the hand-drawn images, as well as the limitations of memory and post-memory, raise important questions about the authority and authenticity of these narratives. By closing analyzing some of the most prominent examples of autobiographical and biographical graphic narratives, students in this class will consider how creators have used the medium and the strategies they used to address its limitations when depicting lived, historical experiences. Our discussion of these autobiographical and biographical narratives will be supplemented by readings in the related academic scholarship, as well as by materials that the creators drew upon in the production of their graphic narratives. The reading list of graphic narratives will consist of

ENGL BC1808,ROOTING FOR THE ANTIHERO     THE EVOLUTI,"How exhausting is it, really, always rooting for the antihero? Not very, our cultural and social landscape would suggest. From films to novels, popstars to political figures, contemporary culture marvels more and more at the misfits, the flawed, the scheming, the petty, the brats. Traditional heroic qualities are no longer necessary to appeal to audiences fascinated with the likes of Tony Soprano or Olivia Pope, the Punisher or Hannah Horvath. But is the antihero a product of the golden age of television? A result of our modern, revisionist impulse to reconsider the villains of our childhood? 
  
This course will explore the complex and evolving figure of the antihero from its origins in the literary canon—in, for instance, Greek tragedy and the picaresque novel—to its prominence in modern fiction, film, and television. In parallel, we will explore how the antihero functions within broader socio-political contexts—whether as a critique of institutional power, a commentary on individualism and alienation, or a reflection of our anxieties about a world in which morality is no longer absolute.
  
Key questions will include: What does it mean to be anti-heroic in the modern world? How does the antihero challenge the distinction between protagonist and antagonist? How do marginalized voices shape and redefine antiheroic figures? What is it about figures who live on the boundary between law and lawlessness—the cowboy, the vigilante, the rebel—that so appeals to us?",Victor Zarour Zarzar,5:40pm,6:55pm,00111,,X1808-20253-001,ROOTING FOR THE ANTIHERO,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X1808-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ENGL1808X001,LECTURE

This class is an introduction to writing fiction, with a focus on the short story. The initial weeks will focus on writing exercises and also deep reading of published short stories, in order to attempt to understand the space we enter when we enter a piece of fiction, what does it mean to move through it, how is it moving. Later, student work will become the main text as the focus shifts into workshop. Stories likely on the syllabus include Herman Melville’s “Bartleby, the Scrivener,” Octavia Butler’s “Speech Sounds,” Mieko Kanai’s “Rabbits,” Carmen Maria Machado’s “The Husband Stitch,” and the flash fiction of Lydia Davis.",Kate Zambreno,11:00am,12:50pm,00269,,X3107-20253-001,INTRO TO FICTION WRITING,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3107-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20253ENGL3107X001,WORKSHOP

  “In the beginner’s mind, possibilities are many, in the expert’s mind, there are few.” — Shunryu Suzuki, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind
  
In this introductory poetry writing workshop, we will cultivate an ardently playful approach to writing, one committed to honoring “beginner’s mind.” Embarrassment, error and amateurism will be embraced as values and fertile grounds (rather than obstructions) for writing.
  
Together we will explore poetry writing as the pursuit and  expression of a liberatory language–the language of our highest attention and freedom– shared  between reader and writer.
  
In addition to workshops, we will alternate between classes centered on formal and thematic  studies with others focussed on contemplative practices and the writing process. Formal and revisionary explorations will be guided by the experiments of Bernadette Mayer, Inger Christensen, Dadaists and the Oulipo; by generative varieties of translation as practiced by Mónica de la Torre and Sawako Nagasaku–homophonic and self-translation; the role of inside jokes and an innocent attention to our environment, inspired by Gertrude Stein and Wadih Saadeh.
  
Drawing on teachings by Corita Kent, art exercises by Kim Beom and Zen Buddhist rituals we will learn contemplative practices that help us create, combine and  consider our attention in order to see how receptive, open, beginner’s mind effort, rather than forced determination toward a particular outcome, underpins our deepest work in writing.",Brionne Janae,2:10pm,4:00pm,00270,,X3110-20253-001,INTRODUCTION TO POETRY WR,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3110-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20253ENGL3110X001,WORKSHOP

What is the difference between a play and a film? No two playwrights will have the same response, but all must address the question. This is a class that revels in that distinction, encouraging students to explore the idiosyncrasy, strangeness, and power of the form. For half the semester, students will be writing in response to prompts that are designed to teach fundamental principles of the form. In addition to writing their own work, every week students will choose two plays from a collection of 150 to read and comment briefly on. During the second half of the semester, students develop a longer work, to be submitted as either a completed one act or a partial draft with notes for a full-length work. Classes are spent reading and discussing students’ work.

Section 1 (taught by Weike Wang):
 
Flash Fiction Workshop. 
This course is an intensive writing workshop focused on the art of flash fiction—stories told in under 1,500 words. The workshop will emphasize experimentation, encouraging students to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling by playing with form, language, and perspective. Readings will include works originally written in English as well as those in translation, offering a broad view of global approaches to flash fiction. Discussions will cover the mechanics of storytelling on a compressed scale, including structure, character development, point of view, dialogue, and style. Authors will include Cheever, Couto, Hempel, Davis, and Wang, and through these readings, students will explore the structural possibilities of the short form, the role of voice, and the ways in which brevity can intensify narrative impact. The class will examine how compression, omission, and implication create resonance in fiction.Each student will write and workshop three original short pieces, receiving detailed feedback from peers and the instructor. The goal is to develop a keen sense of how the economy of language can create depth and complexity in fiction.

Old Wolves and New Grandmothers. 
Once upon a time there was a fiction workshop and each student in the workshop conjured a new role for the animal in their grandmother’s bed. In this workshop, we’ll experiment with how the tone and iconic figures of fairy tales may provide a way into a new work of fiction, though not necessarily a way out. We’ll talk about myriad ways to subvert the expected meaning of the wolf and the wicked in our own time, and what new subtexts may be lurking in the shared stories we reconsider at different points in our lives. “You shift time and location to see what holds true, and why or why not,” novelist Helen Oyeyemi says of the allure of fairy tales as a place of departure for a new work of fiction. We’ll discuss work from writers drawn to subvert and repurpose fairy tales, including Helen Oyeyemi, Barbara Comyns, and Cristina Rivera Garza.",Weike Wang,2:10pm,4:00pm,00277,,X3117-20253-001,FLASH FICTION,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3117-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,W,20253ENGL3117X001,WORKSHOP

Muriel Rukeyser remarked that “American poetry​ has been part of a culture in conflict.” Indeed, culture worldwide is in​ conflict. This course will explore “the necessity of poetry” from a phrase by​ Adrienne Rich. It is organized to ensure the development of new work and​ further study of poetic practice for committed student writers. We will​ examine mostly contemporary poetry using specific poetry collections from​ poets as varied as John Keene, Rosa Alcalá, Megan Fernandes, Harryette​ Mullen, Ilya Kaminsky and Emily Lee Luan as well as ancestors: Rich, June​ Jordan, Gertrude Stein. In the classroom, student poems and ideas about​ poetics are shared, questioned, and critiqued. These selected readings​ explore different strands of poetics that will inform the in-class and​ assigned prompts allowing student writers to expand their interrogation of​ the genre and its many forms.

You will craft and deliver speeches, engage in debates and panel discussions, analyze historical and contemporary speakers, and reflect on your own speeches and those of your classmates. You will explore and practice different rhetorical strategies with an emphasis on information, persuasion and argumentation. For each speaking assignment, you will go through the speech-making process, from audience analysis, purpose and organization, to considerations of style and delivery.

In this section of creative nonfiction, we will explore the essay. We will consider the essay in the original and most open-ended sense of the term—coming from French, essai, meaning “attempt."" This type of essay is also known as a personal essay.  
  
The personal essay is a paradoxical form. It makes rules and then breaks them. It announces itself and then slips out the backdoor. It is a mischief-maker and the successful essayist remembers that, remembers to stay playful.  And that's what our workshop will be about. As we attempt to write and share our stories, let’s ask one another: “what’s the fun of this story?” Let’s urge each other to see how can that fun remain, adhere, and grow through the drafting process.
  
 Most of all, let's use the essay to explore our relationship to writing overall. Phillip Lopate writes that the essay “sets up a relationship with the reader, a dialogue—a friendship.” Seeing the sentence as a set of relationships, one tied to our human relations, we will write and revise with the hope of fostering an enduring relationship with the page.
  
Writers should expect to workshop at least twice, working toward a final portfolio of 15-20 double-spaced pages. We will read as we write including essays by James Baldwin, Jo Ann Beard, Margo Jefferson, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Phillip Lopate.",Nina Sharma,11:00am,12:50pm,00275,,X3134-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3134-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,T,20253ENGL3134X001,WORKSHOP
ENGL BC3157,DANTE AND CHAUCER,"Geoffrey Chaucer, “the father of English literature,” was also the first known English reader of Dante – generally regarded as the greatest poet in a modern European language – and the question of how to respond to the legacy of his powerful predecessor left its mark on many of Chaucer’s works. Was “Chaucer,” the self-identified hero of The Canterbury Tales, based on “Dante,” the poet pilgrim who, in the Commedia, claims to have personally visited Hell, Purgatory and Paradise? And if so, as seems likely, what do we make of Chaucer’s rejection of Dante’s “beautiful style,” and his comparative emphasis on irony, incompleteness, and bodily humor? Reading these foundational authors side-by-side sheds unexpected light on each. Could it be that Chaucer was Dante’s canniest reader? In this
 seminar we will read generous extracts from Chaucer in the original Middle English, as well as the Commedia of Dante, and additional short texts, in modern English translation.",Eugene A Petracca,11:00am,12:50pm,00838,,X3157-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3157-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20253ENGL3157X001,SEMINAR
ENGL BC3159,THE ENGLISH COLLOQUIUM,"Prerequisites: Enrollment limited to Barnard English majors.

Defined by humanism, the Protestant Reformation, and revolution, this was a period of ideological struggle on many levels. Long-held ways of ordering the world came under increasing strain-and sometimes ruptured irreparably. Writers discussed and debated the aims of human knowledge, retooled old literary forms for new purposes, scrambled to take account of an expanded awareness of the globe, and probed the tension between belief and doubt. Throughout this process, they experimented with new literary styles to express their rapidly changing worldviews. This is an intensive course in which we will take multiple approaches to a variety of authors that may include Petrarch, Erasmus, Machiavelli, Castiglione, More, Rabelais, Luther, Calvin, Montaigne, Spenser, Bacon, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Behn, among others.",Ross T Hamilton,12:10pm,2:00pm,00506,,X3159-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3159-20253-001/,To be announced,,Barnard College,4,,T,20253ENGL3159X001,COLLOQUIA

He wrote about these matters as he was involved in the English Civil war, an advocate of liberty (we will consider what kind, for whom?) and revolution, which Americans would embrace as inspiration and to justify the American Revolution. We will critically read Milton’s literary and political texts within the contexts of religious, political, and cultural history of early modern England and Europe but also colonial and revolutionary America—asking difficult questions, and with a sense of how Milton’s writing connects to present issues of our time.",Achsah Guibbory,2:40pm,3:55pm,00507,,X3167-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3167-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ENGL3167X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3173,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL,"In the seventeenth century, a new genre appears across Europe: the novel. Why does it appear? What accounts for its increasing popularity across the eighteenth century? What role does it play, in personal psychology as well as society? To puzzle these questions, we will place the development of the novel within the history of art, philosophy and science, as well as psychology and literary theory. Readings may include novels by Mme. de La Fayette, Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, John Cleland, the Marquis de Sade, William Godwin, and Jane Austen, as well as essays by Benjamin, Adorno, Foucault, Elias, Moretti, and others.",Monica F Cohen,2:40pm,3:55pm,00847,,X3173-20253-001,THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY NO,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3173-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253ENGL3173X001,LECTURE
ENGL BC3177,VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATURE,"“We have become a novel-reading people,” wrote Anthony Trollope in 1870. “Novels are in the hands of us all; from the Prime Minister down to the last-appointed scullery maid.” This course will consider why the novel was so important to Victorian culture and society. What made the Victorian novel such a fertile form for grappling with the unprecedented cultural changes of the nineteenth century? To address this question, we will explore how Victorian novels both responded to, and participated in, major social and cultural shifts of the period, including industrialism and urbanization; colonialism and empire; the changing status of women, sexuality, and marriage; the emergence of Darwinism; class conflict and social reform; and the expansion of education and literacy. This course will also consider more broadly what novels are for, and what the Victorians thought they were for. Do novels represent the world as it really is, or do they imagine it as it ought to be? What kinds of solutions to social and political problems can novels offer? Can novels ethically improve (or corrupt) their readers? We will consider these issues in the context of realism, Victorian literature’s trademark genre, but we’ll also explore an array of other genres, such as the industrial novel, the Bildungsroman, the sensation novel, detective fiction, and gothic fiction. Authors include Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, Wilkie Collins, and others.",Jayne Hildebrand,8:40am,9:55am,00508,,X3177-20253-001,VICTORIAN AGE IN LITERATU,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3177-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253ENGL3177X001,LECTURE

While we will devote some attention to the literary traditions that preceded British colonization, most of our readings will be of texts written in English between 1620 and 1800. These texts--histories, autobiographies, poems, plays, and novels--illuminate the complexity of this period of American culture. They tell stories of pilgrimage, colonization, and genocide; private piety and public life; manuscript and print publication; the growth of national identity (political, cultural, and literary); Puritanism, Quakerism, and Deism; race and gender; slavery and the beginnings of a movement towards its abolition. We will consider, as we read, the ways that these stories overlap and interconnect, and the ways that they shape texts of different periods and genres.",Lisa Gordis,11:40am,12:55pm,00510,,X3179-20253-001,AMERICAN LITERATURE TO 18,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3179-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ENGL3179X001,LECTURE

ENGL BC3195,MODERNISM,"A deeply ambivalent, transatlantic movement, Modernism grapples with revolutionary forces that defy traditional structures: the 19th-century Darwinian inversion to the old idea of order, the advent of psychoanalysis, the crisis of world war, and the anxiety and exuberance of shifting gender paradigms. The ensuing cultural upheaval dis-orders not only the content but also the literary forms of Modernism, giving rise to abstraction, fragmented narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness prose and the extreme erudition T.S. Eliot “shored against the ruins” of so-called civilization in “The Waste Land.”  Special attention will be devoted to how seminal manifestos, most notably ""Tradition and the Individual Talent"" and

ENGL BC3242,LITERATURE OF LIBERATION BEFORE 1900,"“We are all bound up together in one great bundle of humanity,” wrote the abolitionist writer Frances Ellen Watkins Harper a few years after the Civil War. This course explores the creative productions, critiques, and political projects of colonized people themselves, specifically focusing on writers in the indigenous, African American, and global anti-imperialist traditions. How did these heterogeneous communities differently diagnose the context of colonialism? What positive horizons of freedom, equality, and democracy did they aspire towards? What do their works tell us about gender, land, and labor? We explore themes of sovereignty against settler colonialism in the work of indigenous writers like Kandiaronk, William Apess, E. Pauline Johnson, Sarah Winnemucca, Zitkala Sa, and Liliuokalani, Queen of Hawaii. Next, we read the African American abolitionist tradition, beginning with Phillis Wheatley and slave narratives (Frederick Douglass, Mary Prince, Harriet Jacobs) followed by works by Harriet Wilson, Ida B. Wells, and Machado de Assis. The final third of the class will focus on works by those encountering imperialism in Egypt, South Asia, Latin America, the Philippines, and China: Al-Jabarti, Dinabandhu Mitra, José Martí, Jose Rizal, Huang Zunxian, and Qiu Jin.",Ken Chen,11:40am,12:55pm,00024,,X3242-20253-001,LIT OF LIBERATION BEFORE,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3242-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253ENGL3242X001,LECTURE

In this course, we’ll untangle the complicated web of relationships between mothers, daughters, and stepmothers in folk and fairy tales, from ancient Rome to current cinema. We’ll read analytic psychology, feminist literary theory, cultural history, and other critical perspectives to help us analyze the absent mother, virginal daughter, hapless father, and evil stepmother tropes across time and space, so we can defamiliarize these familiar figures and develop a deeper understanding of how and why they dominate the popular imagination.

Adultery in the Novel 
characterizes marriage as “the structure which supports all structure.” Contemporary critics have seen marriage as essential to maintaining the “family values” of the bourgeoisie; feminists and Marxists have challenged the economic assumptions of patriarchally-defined marriage. Folklorists have treated marriage as the endpoint of the search for a safe domestic space.
  
Starting in ancient times with classic fairy tales and the Hebrew Bible, moving on to a famous medieval poem, a medieval memoir, and three nineteenth-century novels, we will encounter cultural expressions which address intimate partnerships with an emphasis on marriage as a defining condition.",Margaret R Ellsberg,12:10pm,2:00pm,00637,,X3249-20253-001,,English @Barnard,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3249-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,M,20253ENGL3249X001,SEMINAR

ENGL BC3645,A Literary History of Marriage,"From its origins, and to the present, marriage has been transactional, arranged, and rarely concerned with the desires or interests of the wife. In the eighteenth-century, and especially through the genre of the novel, women began to insist on right to choose their spouse, and the possibility of marrying for love. Perversely, it is at this point that the descriptions of some of the most disastrous and repressive marriages enter literature, and in the twentieth century film. If “the course of true love never did run smooth” this seminar follows its path, investigating the shifts and transformations of marriage. While the focus of the seminar will be on women, we will also consider men, same-sex marriage, questions of marriage and race in the United States, and marriage in China.",Daphne Miriam Merkin,4:10pm,6:00pm,00843,,X3645-20253-001,A Literary History of Mar,English @Barnard,ENGL,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Merkin,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/X3645-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253ENGL3645X001,SEMINAR

We become cartographers of this conversation and interlocutors within it, as we explore how habits of conceiving truth, power, and the relationship of human beings to the natural world have controlled what counts as exceptional and what ordinary. Where should we direct our awe?

 phenomenal global success. This course will center the female voice and
 subjectivity in the Italian literary tradition, with a focus on celebrated prose writers
 active from the early twentieth century to the present. Some, recently republished
 and reconsidered for the Italian market, have also been re-translated and re-
 introduced to a wider English readership. We will trace the reception of female
 authors within the Italian critical establishment and abroad, and the role
 translation might play in broadening and amplifying their reputation and reach.

ENGL BC3992,SENIOR PROJECT IN CREATIVE WRITING,"Enrollment limited to Barnard senior English majors with a concentration in creative writing.
  
This creative writing workshop represents an opportunity for creative writing concentrators to focus on one large project that will serve as a capstone senior project. As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project—such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement.

In this seminar, our aim will to be read some of the central works of this German thinker carefully and collaboratively in order to become conversant in some of his chief concerns, methodological interventions, and theoretical contributions. We will pay special attention to his concepts of history, politics, negativity, dialectics, literature, and aesthetic form, while also developing the habits required to engage with complex theoretical work. Given Adorno’s wide span interests and immense influence, any sustained inquiry into his work will necessarily open vistas onto contemporary critical debates. To that end, we will also be examining interventions and dialogues with Adorno by later thinkers such as Edward Said, Gillian Rose, Fred Moten, and Fumi Okiji.",Joseph Albernaz,2:10pm,4:00pm,11766,,G6149-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/G6149-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Engineering:Graduate

It will offer grounding in the nineteenth-century emergence of the Renaissance as a cultural and conceptual category, as well as the prevailing scholarly understanding of how sixteenth-century writers, poets, and playwrights negotiated their estrangement from the classical past. But the course will also aim, more urgently, to forge new pathways in classical reception studies. To what uses, we will ask, did English writers put their classical sources, and what imagined ideas about antiquity did they generate as a result? How did that engagement with classical sources shape emergent ideas about gender, race, and class? And though the course will center on the literary production of late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century England, it will also cast a wide geographical net, seeking out the Renaissances and classical pasts that have been neglected in the focus on the European revival of ancient Greece and Rome.

This class will focus on the histories and present of the “Blues epistemology,” which geographer Clyde Woods theorized as a method of reading and analysis that brings race, culture, geography, and political economy together. We will track the epistemology’s origins, performance, and impact throughout various literatures and pay particular attention to its relation to the Blues sounds and Blues people who conceived of it and to whom it continues to call.",Shana Redmond,4:10pm,6:00pm,11768,,W6394-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shana_L._Redmond,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W6394-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Engineering:Graduate

ENGL GR6793,TREES,"Trees shadow the human in faceless fashion. They mark of a form of deep-time (like Darwin’s tree of Life), record and respond to ecological devastation and abundance. Symbolic of the strange proximity of the divine, trees figure as alter-egos or doubles for human lives and their after lives (in figures like the trees of life and salvation, trees of wisdom and knowledge, genealogical trees, et al). As prostheses of thought and knowledge they become synonymous with structure and form, supports for linguistic and other genres of mapping, and markers of organization and reading (Moretti).  As key sources of energy, that is, as food-procurers, wood, and coal (from the Carboniferous period), trees –as we know them today -- are direct correlates with the rise of the Anthropocene.  This course turns to trees as shadows and shade: that is to trees as coerced doubles of the human and as entry ways to an other-world that figures at the limits of thought and language. Part eco-criticism, part philosophy, this course will begin by coupling medieval literary texts with theoretical works, but will expand (and contract) to other time periods and geographic locales.  An undercurrent of the course is the relation of trees to language, knowledge, democracy, aesthetics, indigeneity, colonization, and religion.",Patricia Dailey,4:10pm,6:00pm,11769,,G6793-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/G6793-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Engineering:Graduate

ENGL GU4017,The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic,"This course offers an overview of twentieth-century literary modernism through the lens of the Harlem Renaissance, a movement of Black artistic and intellectual flourishing loosely concentrated in New York City. Formal innovation, explorations of interiority, the autonomy of the artist, and political radicalism were all hallmarks of the works of Black Americans in the 1920s and 1930s, as they similarly came to define those of artists across the U.K. and Europe. We will begin by foregrounding the emergence of the Harlem Renaissance, reading manifestos, retrospective overviews, and signal texts of the period. In what ways—either complementary or competing—did Black artists conceptualize cultural modernity and political legibility? How did Black women understand themselves within these fraught, often masculine frameworks? We will then turn our attention abroad to consider surprising resonances between such authors as Nella Larsen and Virginia Woolf; Langston Hughes and T.S. Eliot; Wallace Thurman and James Joyce. In the final third of the semester, we will discuss continuities and departures between the Harlem Renaissance and the 
Négritude 
movement in Paris, a city sometimes referred to as the capital of the Black Atlantic. The course ultimately invites students to think about modernist literatures from a transatlantic, multiracial, and diasporic perspective, appreciating similarities without glossing over important points of tension and conflict.",Zoe L Henry,10:10am,12:00pm,12962,,W4017-20253-001,The Harlem Renaissance,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4017-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

In this advanced undergraduate seminar, we will survey the diverse poetic forms and traditions from the British North American colonies to Dickinson’s and Whitman’s Civil War-era writings. Most class sessions will be devoted to the poetry of a single author, including the Puritan epics of Anne Bradstreet, the colonial satires of Ebenezer Cooke, the antislavery ballads of George Moses Horton, the Ojibwe verse of Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, and the historical lyrics of Herman Melville. Our course will consider historically-specific theories of poetry and ask how these theories lead to varying conceptions of the aesthetic merit and spiritual and/or social purpose of poetry.

The centerpieces of this course will be what Wilson termed his “century cycle” of plays: each work focusing on the circumstances of Black Americans during a decade of the twentieth century. As we consider these historical framings, we also will explore closely on what Wilson identified as the “four B’s” that influenced his art most emphatically: Bessie Smith (sometimes he called this first B the Blues), Amiri Baraka, Romare Bearden, and Jorge Luis Borges. Accordingly, as we consider theoretical questions of cross-disciplinary conversations in art, we will study songs by Bessie Smith (and broad questions of the music and literary form), plays, prose, and poetry of Baraka (particularly in the context of Wilson’s early Black Arts Movement works), the paintings of Bearden, and the poetry and prose (along with a few lectures and transcribed interviews) of Borges. We will use archival resources (online as well as “hard copy” material, some of it at Columbia) to explore Wilson’s pathways as a writer, particularly as they crisscrossed the tracks of his “four B’s.” Along the way we will examine several drawings and paintings (from his University of Pittsburgh archives) as we delve into the rhythmical shapes, textures, and colors he used on paper and canvas as well as in his plays.

The course will also provide an introduction to the scholarship and methods of jazz studies. We will begin with Ralph Ellisons suggestive proposition that many aspects of American life are jazz-shaped. How then might we define this music called jazz? What are its aesthetic ingredients and forms? What have been its characteristic sounds? How can we move toward a definition that sufficiently complicates the usual formulas of call-response, improvisation, and swing to encompass musical styles that are very different but which nonetheless are typically classified as jazz? With this ongoing problem of musical definition in mind, we will examine works in literature, painting, photography, and film, which may be defined as jazz works or ones that are jazz-shaped.” What is jazz-like about these works? Whats jazz-like about the ways they were produced? And how, to get to the other problem in the courses title, is jazz American? What is the relationship of art to nation? What is the logic of American exceptionalism? What do we make of the many international dimensions of jazz music such as its many non-American practitioners? And what do representations of jazz artists in literature and film tell us about what people have thought about the music?",,11:40am,12:55pm,13621,,W4612-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4612-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ENGL GU4835,The Industrial Novel,"This seminar offers intensive study of “the industrial novel,” a body of mid-Victorian fiction responding to the economic volatility and class conflict that accompanied the rise of industrial production.  In little more than a decade, treatments of this broad concern by a number of major novelists converged in a set of distinctive formal strategies, yet the relatively brief prominence of the form underscores an unusually direct connection with contemporary political anxieties.  The industrial novel presses against the increasingly domestic preoccupations of mid-Victorian fiction, so familiar in “the marriage plot,” but it thereby throws those preoccupations into sharp relief, and more broadly illuminates the construction of Victorian domesticity.   We’ll be especially interested in the intersections of gender and class, the interplay of socio-economic history and narrative form, and the political dimensions of the mid-Victorian novel.  Finally, the topic poses large questions about genre and literary history: does “the industrial novel” denote a genre, and why apply that tag to works that rarely depict industrial labor?   Why not the “social problem” novel, the “domestic novel in Northern dress,” or even “the novel of insurrection”?  Major authors include Disraeli, Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, Kingsley, Dickens, and George Eliot; we’ll also gather in some of the political economy of John Stuart Mill and Marx, as well as the social commentary of Carlyle and Engels.",James E Adams,2:10pm,4:00pm,12963,,W4835-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4835-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

This is particularly true in American cinema, where horror tends to cost less and earn more for film producers than almost any other subgenre. The rise of horror has also, of course, been affected by the rise of perceived and real threats to public and individual safety—pandemics, government malfeasance, ecological catastrophe, etc. But the recent surge of popularity in horror doesn’t mean it’s a “new” genre; far from it, the horror genre extends as far back in American film history as film itself as a medium. This course will look at the entire history of horror cinema, focusing on American film. We will start before the era of the “talkie” movie, and will move forward, taking exemplary films from each decade, until we reach about 2020. The course will think about genre, subgenre, and formal elements of filmic analysis, and will also consider elements of American history and culture that inform and inflect the more concrete, material elements of film.",,8:40am,9:55am,14307,,W4938-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4938-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ENGL GU4956,THE ASIAN AMERICAN NOVEL,"What does it mean to write an Asian American novel? In this seminar, we will explore this question by examining a range of novels written by Asian American authors. I use the term “Asian American” to underscore its political importance as an identity and community formation that consolidated in the late 1960s. These novels we will read were published from the early twentieth century to as recently as earlier this calendar year. Some are bestsellers, prize winners, or have been deemed as pivotal to the development of Asian American literature and its history. Others are not. Some are well known authors; others are newer or emergent writers. Some feature characters who are Asian or Asian American. Others explicitly questions our assumptions and expectations regarding literary and cultural representations of Asians and Asian Americans. Across their work, these authors are nevertheless held together in part by their engagement with transnational relations in Asia and North America, including U.S. expansion across to the Pacific, migration and immigration legislation, labor exclusions and political resistance, and the changing dynamics of the United States in the wake of a so-called global Asian century.
  
A guiding principle will inform our work: Asian American writers have long been interested in theorizing the novel as an artistic, literary, and political form. While the content of these novels will of course be important, we will also examine how Asian American writers have explicitly experimented with the 
form 
of the novel as a genre, including romance, 
bildungsroman
, hybrid creative nonfiction, speculative fiction, postmodern palimpsest, YA novel, apocalyptic dystopia. To guide us in this goal, we will read scholars who have theorized the novel as a genre, we’ll also situate this work alongside the substantial history of Asian American literary scholarship on the novel.",Denise Cruz,10:10am,12:00pm,11764,,W4956-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W4956-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

Priority will be given to CS students closer to graduation. Your number on the waitlist is not a factor in admission. But this class is large, and we hope to accommodate everyone who needs to take the class. Last year's class is a good model for what this year's syllabus will be: 
http://coms4170.cs.columbia.edu/2024-spring/
  
**Attendance required**
 This class is highly interactive, and attendance for many of the lectures is mandatory. Especially in the second half of the class, students must attend in-class project mentoring sessions to get feedback from their TA and fellow students.
  
 
**Technical Preparation**
 The first half of the class is quite technical, we introduce principles of usable design and integrate them in to technical assignments. There is a lot of programming in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python (server-side). Whereas we do teach these technologies, we constantly find that students who have seen them before have a better time in class. Former students have advised future students to do an online web programming series like CodeAcademy (which is sadly no longer free). Advanced Programming is an advised pre- requisite, but the true pre-requisite is simply coding experience. You will be expected to figure out some of the programming aspects by yourself, and you need the maturity to do that. Hint: ask GPT. If you are going to email me about this class, please use a subject line
 that says I read the SSOL message for COMS 4170 and I still have a question. I hope to see many of you in the spring :)

Ultimately, we will aim to situate the production of Shakespeare’s early career within the highly collaborative, competitive, and experimental theatrical and literary cultures of late sixteenth-century England.",James Stephen Shapiro,10:10am,11:25am,11755,,W1335-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W1335-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ENGL UN2702,Early Modern Theater,"This course investigates the boldly experimental world of the early modern English theater. The opening of London’s commercial playhouses in the last quarter of the sixteenth century fundamentally changed the nature of popular entertainment, offering eager spectators an array of secular drama for the first time in English history. The playwrights who wrote for these theaters collaborated and competed with each other to produce the bombastic heroes of tragedy, the upstart social climbers of city comedy, and the adventurers of romance, reimagining the possibilities of stage performance in the process. We will read a range of playwrights and dramatic genres in this course, asking how these plays not only spoke to each other, but intervened in the issues of class, race, gender, sexuality, and politics that defined early modernity. We will also spend time discussing the plays in performance, attending to the ways that the conditions of early modern stagecraft influence literary meaning. Finally, we will give attention to the performance styles and techniques of those actors who, in inspiring playgoers’ admiration and adoration, became London’s very first celebrities.",Lauren E Robertson,4:10pm,5:25pm,13566,,W2702-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W2702-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

ENGL UN3255,Victorian Relations,"Victorian literature, as one of its leading critics writes, is concerned above all with “
relationships
 and their representation.”  Relationships between individuals, groups, or nations are of course central to literature from all periods, but they figure with particular prominence in Victorian British writing, for two reasons.  First, the Victorian period follows an era that often fetishized the solitary individual: if Romantic writers frequently focused on figures in isolation, Victorian writers responded by panning out to consider human beings primarily in their social relations.  Second, the later nineteenth century witnessed revolutions in the conceptualization of relations between different classes, races, sexes, and species.  The new ideas were not limited to philosophers or scientists but permeated public discourse to an unprecedented extent.
  
In this course we will study a representative sampling of Victorian writing about relationships, possibly including such topics as relations between men and women, Britons and others nationalities, humans and animals, or past and present.  In addition we will consider the relation between different literary genres as we compare the way each topic is represented in fiction, poetry, drama, and non-fictional prose.",Erik Gray,12:10pm,2:00pm,11756,,W3255-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3255-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

In the first half of the course, we’ll read authors who wrote in the period before the legal abolition of slavery in the U.S., and whose works made direct contributions to the abolitionist cause. In the second half of the course, we’ll read authors who wrote in the years after the Civil Rights Movement, and whose works treated slavery as a historical phenomenon. But regardless of whether we’re discussing literature from the nineteenth century or the twentieth in our meetings, we’ll always be studying novels that condemn slavery as a legal, moral, and social institution; and that explore the wounds that slavery left upon individual and collective psyches; and that ask whether and how slavery’s tremendous wrongs could ever be redressed.",Austin Graham,12:10pm,2:00pm,11757,,W3494-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3494-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

We will divide our time more or less equally among three figures: John Donne, the libertine-turned-priest whose poetry spans erotic and devotional extremes; George Herbert, the humble parson whose daring experiments in poetic form can seem uncannily postmodern; and finally Andrew Marvell, whose nickname—“the Chameleon”—gestures both toward the shiftiness of his political affiliations and the radical ambiguity of his poetry.

ENGL UN3795,SENIOR ESSAY RESEARCH METHODS,"The senior essay research methods seminar, offered in several sections in the fall semester, lays out the basic building blocks of literary and cultural studies. What kinds of questions do literary and cultural critics ask, and what kinds of evidence do they invoke to support their arguments? What formal properties characterize pieces of criticism that we find especially interesting and/or successful? How do critics balance the desire to say something fresh vis-a-vis the desire to say something sensible and true? What mix of traditional and innovative tools will best serve you as a critical writer? Voice, narrative, form, language, history, theory and the practice known as “close reading” will be considered in a selection of exemplary critical readings. Readings will also include “how-to” selections from recent guides including Amitava Kumar’s Every Day I Write the Book, Eric Hayot’s The Elements of Academic Style and Aaron Ritzenberg and Sue Mendelsohn’s How Scholars Write.
  
The methods seminar is designed to prepare those students who choose to write a senior essay to complete a substantial independent project in the subsequent semester. Individual assignments will help you discover, define and refine a topic; design and pursue a realistic yet thrilling research program or set of protocols; practice “close reading” an object (not necessarily verbal or textual) of interest; work with critical sources to develop your skills of description and argument; outline your project; build out several sections of the project in more detail; and come up with a timeline for your spring semester work. In keeping with the iterative nature of scholarly research and writing, the emphasis is more on process than on product, but you will end the semester with a clear plan for your essay itself as well as for the tasks you will execute to achieve that vision the following semester.

ENGL UN3805,The Political Novel,"Is the political novel a genre? It depends on your understanding both of politics and of the novel. If politics means parties, elections, and governing, then few novels of high quality would qualify. If on the other hand “the personal is the political,” as the slogan of the women’s movement has it, then almost everything the novel deals with is politics, and few novels would not qualify. This seminar will try to navigate between these extremes, focusing on novels that center on the question of how society is and ought to be constituted. Since this question is often posed ambitiously in so-called “genre fiction” like thrillers and sci-fi, which is not always honored as “literature,” it will include some examples of those genres as well as uncontroversial works of the highest literary value like Melville’s “Benito Cereno,” Ellison’s “Invisible Man,” and Camus’s “The Plague.”",Bruce Robbins,4:10pm,6:00pm,11760,,W3805-20253-001,,English and Comparative Literature,ENGL,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Robbins_%28academic%29,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ENGL/W3805-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

EPID P8479,Epidemiologic Methods in Global Mental H,"Mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders are substantial drivers of the global burden of disease. The burden is particularly high in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) where over 80% of persons in need of MNS services go untreated. Yet for decades, attention to MNS epidemiologic research in LMIC was scarce relative to both psychiatric epidemiology studies conducted in high-income countries as well as infectious disease epidemiology studies in LMIC. Recently, however, the emerging field of global mental health has been recognized by international agencies, including the United Nations (via the Sustainable Development Goals) and the World Health Organization (via the Mental Health Action Plan) as major funding agencies, including NIH, CDC, and the UK MRC have followed suit in prioritizing global mental health research. 
  
 
  
As the field has emerged, challenges in how to appropriately conduct public mental health research in LMIC contexts have surfaced. Such challenges require the appropriate application of epidemiologic methods in order to accurately measure and describe MNS problems in LMIC and evaluate and implement intervention approaches. Epidemiologic methods to be discussed in this course include: complex survey designs to measure MNS prevalence in humanitarian and emergency settings; validation of mental health screening tools in the absence of a gold standard criterion among culturally diverse populations; evaluation of MNS intervention effectiveness using experimental and non-experimental designs; novel methods for assessing clinical competency and intervention fidelity of lay mental health providers in LMIC; and implementation science tools, designs, and analysis approaches for translating evidence-based interventions into practice in LMIC. 
  
 
  
The course is designed to complement Priorities in Global Mental Health (P6813), which provides a broad overview of priority issues in global mental health, and epidemiologic methods series courses (e.g., Quant Core Module / P6400, and Epidemiology II). The course is also designed to be practical in the sense that the intent is for students to learn the ‘how to’ of conducting global mental health epidemiologic studies in the field.

EPID P8491,Generative AI for Epidemiologists,"Generative AI tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), represent a subset of artificial intelligence technologies capable of generating new content, including text, images, audio, and video, that mimics human-generated content. Unlike earlier AI approaches, such as machine learning, which are designed to recognize or classify data, generative AI can create novel data outputs by leveraging the patterns, styles, or information it has learned during its training process. This ability to recognize and generate patterns shares many similarities with the goals of Epidemiology, which focuses on identifying patterns of health and disease in populations.
  
Although these generative AI models are relatively new, their adoption in the research environment, including in Epidemiology, is rapidly increasing. The introduction of LLMs has the potential to revolutionize scientific research by providing unprecedented speed, innovation, and efficiency. This is achieved by enabling novel and compelling ways to explore data. However, the complexity of the neural networks behind these models' decision-making processes and lack of transparency in data training sources, can make it challenging to understand how they arrive at specific outcomes and biases. The opacity of these models, coupled with the necessity of training them on potentially biased data sets, underscores the need for responsible use. Epidemiologists, therefore, face the challenge of ensuring that research findings generated by AI are real, ethical, and reliable.
  
This course is designed to introduce LLMs, highlighting their potential to enhance epidemiological research. It aims to explore innovative ways LLMs can be utilized, understand the myriad ethical considerations involved, investigate the potential public health concerns raised by AI, learn how to conduct basic analyses, and examine firsthand applications of LLMs within the field of epidemiology.

ERMC PS5430,LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT,"Indicators of companies running into hard times typically include revenue volatility, loss of key personnel, reputational damage, and increased litigation. However, company failures are frequently marked by insufficient liquidity, or the lack of cash to meet obligations. Liquidity risk is the unexpected change in a company’s cash resources or demands on such resources that results in the untimely sale of assets, and/or an inability to meet contractual demands and/or default. In extreme cases, the lack of sufficient cash creates severe losses and results in company bankruptcy.
  
An institution’s cash resources and obligations can and must be managed. Indeed, the field of liquidity risk management is an established part of treasury departments at sizable institutions. The regularity of cash flows and the turbulence of business and markets must be assessed and quantified. This course provides students the tools and techniques to manage all types of liquidity challenges including the need to sell assets unexpectedly in the market, or work through ‘‘run‐on-the‐bank’’ situations for financial services companies.",Joseph Dziwura,6:10pm,8:00pm,12005,,K5430-20253-001,,Enterprise Risk Management,ERMC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ERMC/K5430-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20253ERMC5430K001,LECTURE

FILM AF5132,American Film: Cult & Exploitation,"Once associated with images of fishnet-costumed fans of 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
, the concept of the “cult film” has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years. This course seeks to assess the popularization of the phenomenon, asking: what exactly 
is 
a cult film? And what does the mainstreaming of the concept suggest about our changing relation to today’s media environment?
  
Whereas most types of film can be defined through widely recognized elements of story and setting (tumbleweed, deserts, gunfights: it’s a western), this is far from being the case with cult. Some have defined the cult film as “created” by audiences (again, 
Rocky Horror
); others in terms of nonclassical or aberrant modes of textuality (e.g., various forms of “bad taste” cinema). This course, however, seeks to go beyond audience- and text-based definitions, instead placing cult within a series of historical contexts:
  
  
as an outgrowth of film industry practices that sustained the 
low cultural status
 of certain movie types during the classical Hollywood cinema (e.g., B movies, exploitation, etc.);
  
as the product of 
audience reception
 practices, shaped by the politics of cultural taste and “camp” viewing practices that first coalesced during the “midnight movie” phenomenon of the late 1960s/1970s;
  
as sustained by the 
transnational flow
 of media content, offering new frameworks for understanding “national” cinemas.
 
  
In offering such an approach, this course seeks to isolate the different uses to which “cult” has been put, in order to indicate how pervasive and adaptable the idea has recently become. As we will see, the cult phenomenon implies both a perspective on the past, hence inseparable from the experience of nostalgia, as well as an engagement with our media-driven present.",Robert King,10:10am,12:55pm,14139,,R5132-20253-001,Amer Film: Cult & Exploit,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/R5132-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Schools of the Arts,3,,R,20253FILM5132R001,LECTURE

The course will culminate in the writing of a short pitch document.

We will distill the craft of screenwriting by looking through the prism of adaption in order to understand which elements of the novel translate into film, and why. We will consider novels with the mercenary detachment of a screenwriter, scouring for scraps with value for a screenplay. As we compare the original text with the finished film, we will distill the essence of the screenplay form. What is plot, action, dialog, metaphor? How do we converge these goals? We will decipher, with the clinical eye of a detective, what the screenwriter took from the novel and what they left behind.

FILM AF6810,Coding for Media Studies,"The term “digital humanities” (DH) has long been used to describe scholarship at the intersection of digital technologies and humanities disciplines. Although initially characterized by quantitative analysis and number-crunching, DH today enjoys a far broader mandate encompassing new fields like software studies, data visualization, critical code studies, and more. This course proposes to ride the wave of these developments.
  
Specifically, it explores how coding can be harnessed to the disciplines of film and media studies. Over the past few years, developments in generative AI have placed basic coding expertise within the reach of all. But what possibilities open up from these changes? Over the course of over a dozen weeks, students in this class will learn ways in which coding can help refine and reimagine traditional scholarly agendas (e.g., film analysis, media industry studies, archival restoration, etc.). But the class also shows how coding opens up entirely new ways of working with media as objects of study.",,6:00pm,9:00pm,13604,,R6810-20253-001,,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/R6810-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Schools of the Arts,3,,W,20253FILM6810R001,SEMINAR

FILM BC3119,SCREENWRITING FUNDAMENTALS,"Prerequisites: FILM BC3201 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to 12 students. Priority is given to Film Studies majors/concentrations in order of class seniority. Corequisites: (Since this is a Film course, it does not count as a writing course for English majors with a Writing Concentration.)
  
This course is ideal for writers of their FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD screenplays. The first several weeks will focus on STORY: What it is, what it isn’t, how to recognize the difference. How to find your own individual stories that nobody else in the universe can tell.
  
From there we will make the transition to the highly individualized techniques, the strengths and limitations, the dynamics of telling a SCREEN STORY; what to leave in, what to leave out. As Michelangelo puts it—starting with a block of marble and chipping away everything that isn’t David.  Through studies of existing screenplays and films in coordination with and hands-on writing exercises which we will share in class, we will develop our skills in all aspects of screenwriting; building fascinating characters, dialogue, story construction (The BIG PICTURE) and scene construction (The Small Picture)

FILM BC3201,INTRO FILM & MEDIA STUDIES,"Prerequisites: Open to first-year students.
  
We derive much of our information about the world from visual media. Social networks, television, cinema: all shape our aesthetic sensibilities and our political visions. Yet we often lack a basic understanding of what could be called “visual literacy.” This introductory course gives students the critical tools to analyze how film and other visual media 
really
 work – in order to appreciate their artistic and social achievements, as well as to guard against their insidious manipulative devices.
  
In the first part of the semester, we focus on 
film analysis
 through a detailed study of the different production phases of filmmaking – from screenwriting and mise-en-scène to editing and film scoring. We pay special attention to the way in which certain stylistic and narrative choices have particular ideological effects. The second part of the course looks at 
film history
 
through a comprehensive, chronological overview of its main movements and periods, including the coming of sound in Hollywood cinema, post-war Italian Neorealism, the emergence of world 
auteurs
, New Waves of the 1960s and 1970s, etc. Students will use the hermeneutical tools learnt in film analysis to intellectually engage with some masterworks of film history. In the third and final part of the semester, we study the major debates of 
film theory
 from perspectives such as auteurism, formalism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, postcolonial and queer studies, etc.

FILM GR6815,Hitchcock,"Unique among Hollywood directors, Hitchcock played on two boards.  As a master of entertainment who had nothing to say, he produced work as thoroughly trivial as it was utterly compelling.  But thanks to the French reception of his work in 1950s, Hitchcock also came to be considered a master of art, the Auteur par excellence.  If his films had nothing to say, they hardly needed to; in their unparalleled formal originality, they distilled the pure essence of cinema itself.  The course will focus on this dialectic between entertainment and art, between saying nothing and being everything. We shall pay particular attention to a Style that is, on the one hand, commodified as a “touch” that all can recognize, and, on the other, recessed in strange, inconsequential, gibberish-making

FILM GR6985,The Deaths of Cinema,"Looked at one way, the history of cinema is a series of death knells. While the rhetoric of crisis is especially acute today, with the very existence of movie theaters imperiled by the dominance of streaming services, predictions of cinema’s demise are as old as the medium itself — one of its inventors is said to have called it “an invention without a future” and its evolution is marked by moments of technological and cultural change that were perceived or experienced as existential threats.
  
This course traces the arc of cinema through its many supposed deaths: the industrialization of movies, the arrival of sound, the threat of television and the home theater, the compensatory innovations of color and widescreen and CGI, the rise of media conglomeration, the invention of digital technology, the migration of the moving image into ever more settings and contexts (galleries, portable devices, the virtual realm), and so on. We will explore the circumstances that led to these inflection points and the ways in which each threshold period of change reshaped the landscape and language of cinema. We will also consider the periodic death throes (and various afterlives) of film criticism, film theory, and cinephilia.",Dennis Lim,2:10pm,4:40pm,13867,,G6985-20253-001,,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/G6985-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Engineering:Graduate

FILM GU4109,Auteur Study: Lubitsch and Wilder,"This seminar analyzes the tension in Hollywood between industry self-censorship of film (roughly 1929-1965) and the European émigrés who brought a more cosmopolitan, sexually modern perspective to the genre of comedy.  Students will be introduced to the history of Hollywood’s Production Code (popularly known as the Hays Code), which institutionalized self-administered censorship.  In addition, students will study the genre of comedy, where we often discover implicit subversion of the censorship code. 
  
The course will teach students about the change in the industry brought about by new talent from Europe during the classical Hollywood period.  In particular, students will study the biographies and work of two directors, the Austrian/German émigrés Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder, whose separate careers bracket the beginning and end of the censorship code.  In the 1920s, as Hollywood moved towards a codified censorship code, Ernst Lubitsch developed his infamous “Lubitsch touch,” which subverted the Hays Code by hinting at possible sexual indiscretions through verbal and visual double entendres and other aesthetic strategies. Many producers and directors learned how to subvert the code from Lubitsch’s films; like Lubitsch, while emphatically publicizing their belief in and rigid practice of self-censorship, these producers and directors used Lubitsch-like techniques to hint at salacious attitudes and behaviors, which they had claimed to have censored.
  
Billy Wilder was one of these directors.  Wilder learned from Lubitsch directly, working as screenwriter on Lubitsch’s films 
Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife
 (1938) and 
Ninotchka
 (1939).  With a handful of other Hollywood personnel, Billy Wilder is credited with directly challenging and bringing the Hays Code to an end, particularly with his film 
Some Like It Hot
 (1959).  Wilder moved sexual indiscretions and illicit desire into the open in this film and others such as 
The Apartment
 (1960).",Ronald Gregg,9:10am,1:00pm,12686,,W4109-20253-001,Auteur Stu: Lubitsch & Wi,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/W4109-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

FILM GU4920,Seeing Narrative,"An advanced film theory ""workshop"" in which we shall avoid reading film theory in favor of a selection of other texts, taken mainly from the domains of art history, philosophy, and literature. Our central question will be: What can we, who have grown up in the age of cinema and digital media, learn from discourses about vision and its relation to narrative that pre-date the cinema, or that consider the cinema only marginally? In this course, we shall begin to approach some of the major topics of contemporary film theory -- narrativity, subject-construction, the relation of words to images -- through the lens of texts that have remained largely outside the network of citations and references we normally associate with the work of professional media theory. We might begin the groundwork for an ""opening up"" or critique of some of the blind spots of current theory; at the very least, we shall be reading works that challenge our usual ways of theorizing.",James A Schamus,6:10pm,8:40pm,13012,,W4920-20253-001,,Film,FILM,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Schamus,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/W4920-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

New opportunities and limitations offered by emergent technologies are augmenting the grammar of storytelling, as creators wrestle with an ever-shifting digital landscape. New Media Art pulls back the curtain on transmedial works of fiction, non-fiction, and emergent forms that defy definition. Throughout the semester well explore projects that utilize Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things, alongside a heavy-hitting selection of new media thinkers, theorists, and critics. The course will be co-taught as a dialogue between artistic practice and new media theory. Lance Weiler, a new media artist and founder of Columbia’s Digital Storytelling Lab, selected the media artworks; Rob King, a film and media historian, selected the scholarly readings.

FILM GU4955,History of American Television,"From its relative appearance in American homes (ca. 1950 - 1955) through the first decade of the 21st century television has remained (arguably) the most culturally, socially and politically determinative technology in American life.  The exchanges that occur between the content of American television and its ever-broadening audience really shaped perspective on the American character and American values across fifty years.  Indeed, it’s difficult to imagine that the cultures of consensus and conformity that shaped the 1950s were in fact attainable in the absence of television.  But, and at the same time, we must admire the creativity of shows like 
Donna Reed
 or 
Wagon Train
 that made certain that subtilty insured the advocacy for a more democratic America.  
  
We begin with brief attention to the most immediate creative influences on early television: vaudeville, and radio.  Across the semester we will then consider the evolution of the various technologies that shaped and reshaped the American experience of television.  While our focus remains on creative content, we must also note the moments where television afforded new experiences of collective sympathy (JFK and MLK assassinations, the Vietnam War etc.) as well as collective failure (The Pentagon Papers, Iran Contra, Rodney King) and triumph (Civil Rights Movement across the American South, the moon landing etc.). We will also, of course, consider the full implications of television “events” that afforded news kinds national debate concerning the very soul of America: Roots, the final episode of  M*A*S*H*,  and The Day After)
  
Finally, we will conclude with discussion of HBO and the formative impress of unprecedented creative achievement: The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Mad Men; and, we must consider that during the early years of the 21st century these serial dramas represent a particular (and unprecedented) manifestation of American art and artistry.",Ben Alexander,6:10pm,8:40pm,14268,,W4955-20253-001,History of American Telev,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/W4955-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

FILM UN2020,CINEMA HIST II: 1930-1960,"This course examines major developments and debates in the history of cinema between 1930 and 1960, from the consolidation of the classic Hollywood studio system in the early sound era to the articulation of emergent ;new waves; and new critical discourses in the late 1950s.

FILM UN2132,American Film: Cult & Exploitation,"Once associated with images of fishnet-costumed fans of 
The Rocky Horror Picture Show
, the concept of the “cult film” has gone increasingly mainstream in recent years. This course seeks to assess the popularization of the phenomenon, asking: what exactly 
is 
a cult film? And what does the mainstreaming of the concept suggest about our changing relation to today’s media environment?
  
Whereas most types of film can be defined through widely recognized elements of story and setting (tumbleweed, deserts, gunfights: it’s a western), this is far from being the case with cult. Some have defined the cult film as “created” by audiences (again, 
Rocky Horror
); others in terms of nonclassical or aberrant modes of textuality (e.g., various forms of “bad taste” cinema). This course, however, seeks to go beyond audience- and text-based definitions, instead placing cult within a series of historical contexts:
  
  
as an outgrowth of film industry practices that sustained the 
low cultural status
 of certain movie types during the classical Hollywood cinema (e.g., B movies, exploitation, etc.);
  
as the product of 
audience reception
 practices, shaped by the politics of cultural taste and “camp” viewing practices that first coalesced during the “midnight movie” phenomenon of the late 1960s/1970s;
  
as sustained by the 
transnational flow
 of media content, offering new frameworks for understanding “national” cinemas.
 
  
In offering such an approach, this course seeks to isolate the different uses to which “cult” has been put, in order to indicate how pervasive and adaptable the idea has recently become. As we will see, the cult phenomenon implies both a perspective on the past, hence inseparable from the experience of nostalgia, as well as an engagement with our media-driven present.",Robert King,10:10am,12:55pm,11487,,R2132-20253-001,Amer Film: Cult & Exploit,Film,FILM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FILM/R2132-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

FILM UN2410,LAB IN WRITING FILM CRITICISM,"Lab in Writing Film Criticism 
  
This course will focus on writing fresh, original criticism, on developing an individual voice, and on creating strong arguments supporting your ideas (qualities that translate to many areas, from reviewing to pitching a film project). Screenings in and outside class will be followed by discussion and in-class writing exercises, as well as regular writing assignments. How do you choose an effective critical approach? How do you make your opinions vivid and convincing on the page? We will also analyze recent criticism and consider the changing landscape of film criticism today.

FILM UN3055,Film Adaptation,"This course will explore the transformation of literary texts onto the big screen of motion pictures.  Adaptation is an act of re-visioning, a way of expanding the reach of a given story while still upholding its unique, immutable grace and power.
  
That’s easier said than done. The screenwriter who is tasked with an adaptation reads that source text with an eagle eye for all that is embedded therein. They don’t need to be utterly faithful to the source. In fact, they can’t be. But the source is a holistic entity, a product of another literary mind (and soul). It’s a gestalt that demands respect and thoughtful creative interpretation. And like all strong works of art, it contains beautiful secrets, some of which good screenwriters will find and preserve.
  
And they must. Half of the feature films made in America are adaptations. Many of their sources are already beloved. Those that aren’t, deserve the wider audience that film can bring. All story forms have adapted each other since 
Pyramus and Thisbe
 sprung from Ovid’s
 Metamorphoses
, later to inspire 
Romeo and Julie 
and
 West Side Story.
 Adaptation is how stories continue to inspire humans across time. It is therefore a core skill of the screenwriter’s art and livelihood.
  
Adaptation is a reflex of mind.  We “see” what we read, and we “read” what we see.
  
I have a dream.  I tell you about it.  Already, I’m adapting my own inner life into a spoken version of a dream I have salvaged from the chaos of dreaming.  And yet I’m compelled to relate that dream to you because it had some gravitational pull that made the story of that story well worth the telling.
  
To adapt any story for film is to make its original content visible and audible, through dialogue, behavior, theme and visual metaphor. It is to take the reflective and make it active, show more and talk less, imbed theme in plot, turn ideas and symbols into images, expand or condense it as needed, shape its new timeframe, and emphasize story at least as much as character.
  
Every source must be approached using different rules of engagement.  Literature, plays, and true-life stories all resist the morphology of adaptation in unique ways. But the great equalizer is film’s deliberately kinesthetic structure. Character and structure are one in the same. And movies must 
move. 
This is a process of translating the

FREN BC3077,JALOUSIE-LITTERATURE FRANCAIS,"This course takes jealousy-in its psychosexual, socio-political, ontological dimensions, and in its formal implications-as a lens through which to view a series of seminal works of French literature from the Middle Ages to the 21st century. These works include: 12th-century Arthurian legend (Béroul); a late-medieval, proto-feminist short story (Navarre); 17th-century neo-classical tragedy (Corneille); 12th and 17th-century folkloric forms (Marie de Frances lai and Perraults fairy tale, respectively); the Enlightenment philosophical novel (Montesquieu); the 19th-century realist novel (Balzac); the early 20th-century modernist novel (Proust); and the nouveau roman (Robbe-Grillet). Two contemporary adaptations (Singers 2008 novel based on the Navarre story, and Chabrols 1996 film based on Prousts novel) will also be studied. In addition, a selection of highly condensed, relevant secondary readings (excerpts of 10 pages of less) will provide students with an introduction to an array of theoretical approaches to literary study: most notably, psychoanalysis, political philosophy, and literary theory.

FREN BC3104,Women Writers of Contemporary Middle Eas,"Since the last decades of the twentieth century there has been a dramatic increase in the number of women writers from the Middle East and North Africa. This advanced course, which will be taught mainly in French, provides a window into this rich and largely neglected branch of world literature. Students will encounter the breadth and creativity of contemporary Middle Eastern and North African women’s literature by reading a range of twentieth- and twenty-first-century novels, short stories, memoirs and poetry available in French or in translation, and by viewing films that are from or about Iran, Lebanon, Algeria, and Egypt. How do Middle Eastern women authors address women’s oppression – both social and physical – and enunciate issues such as the tension between tradition and modernity, sexuality, identity and class from a female perspective? What literary traditions and models do they draw on? How different are those texts written in French for a global audience, as opposed to those written in Persian or Arabic? What are the effects of reading them in translation? Authors will include Marjane Satrapi, Shahrnush Parsipur, Assia Djebar, Maïssa Bey and Nawal El Saadawi.",Melanie Heydari,11:40am,12:55pm,00264,,X3104-20253-001,WOMEN WRITERS MIDEAST AFR,French @Barnard,FREN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FREN/X3104-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253FREN3104X001,LECTURE
FREN BC3105,EXISTENTIALISM,"Prerequisites: Successful completion of Intermediate II French or the equivalent. In-depth survey of the writers who exemplified French existentialism: Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir. The texts have been chosen for the richness with which they address fundamental philosophical questions about the meaning of life, especially questions of death and suffering, freedom and responsibility, legitimate and illegitimate violence. The first objective of this class is to show how existentialist thought combines literature and philosophy; the second objective is to gain a broad, but also deep familiarity with 20th-century French literature and thought.

FREN BC3111,Language and Pop Culture in Contemporary,"What are French people 
actually
 saying to each other? You’ve taken French for 3+ years, have been reading literature, watching films and writing about them in sophisticated analyses. Yet, conversations among native speakers may still elude you. This course is designed to help you bridge that gap, and gain a better understanding of the slang (
argot
) and the pop culture references that contribute to French’s vibrancy. Together we will review a variety of contemporary French popular art forms, from music, film and graphic novels to street art, film, and food culture. We will explore the history of these genres, and the ways in which French identity is continuously (re)-established in its popular culture with and against the influences of decolonization, Americanization and globalization.

FREN GU4156,What's Left of Enlightenment?,"The Enlightenment was a transformative intellectual movement that shaped our modern world. But many of its key tenets—the ideal of a Republic of Letters, the faith in science as a tool to transform society, the fight against prejudice and obscurantism, the principle of religious tolerance, and the cultivation of critical reason through dialogue—are under attack today. In this seminar, we will ask both what the Enlightenment was and what’s left of it today. Special attention will be paid to voices of dissent within the Enlightenment and notably those of women. How might these critical voices help us to understand the fate of Enlightenment values in our current moment?
  
Authors studied will include Voltaire, Châtelet, Montesquieu, Graffigny, Deffand, Rousseau, Diderot and Gouges.
  
The seminar will be offered in English, but advanced reading knowledge of French is required.

We will consider complex resonances between literary narratives and histories of music culture and aesthetics, asking how writers use music to world-build, to characterize, and to situate a text culturally and politically. Throughout the semester, we will pay particular attention to narratives that showcase the musical lives of characters belonging to historically marginalized groups. In doing so, we will question how race, gender, and sexuality intersect with musical histories of aesthetic power. Literary readings may include works by Jane Austen, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, and James Joyce. Secondary readings in performance studies and musical aesthetics may include selections by Jennifer Lynn Stoever, Judith Butler, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, Maria Edgeworth, and others.",Elizabeth Weybright,11:40am,12:55pm,00180,,X1128-20253-001,,First-Year Writing @Barnard,FYWB,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/FYWB/X1128-20253-001/,To be announced,,Barnard College,3,,TR,20253FYWB1128X001,LECTURE

How are constructions of gender used to police what kinds of stories are told, who can tell them, and who is believed? What forms and strategies of narration are available and to whom? Our focus on tongues—both linguistic and anatomical—allows us to ask questions about the forms that language takes and the relationship of narrations and language to the body. How have women engaged and re-deployed existing myths and narratives? How is the self both constructed and policed through narratives of gender, race, class, sexuality, family? In our analyses, we’ll work to challenge fixed or binary understandings of gender and power by asking how these writers engage and challenge the various ways in which the category of ""women"" is constructed within culture.

GERM BC3105,Comical Expression in Multicult Lit/Film,"This course is designed for participants who are interested in learning more about the role of humor in 20th/21st-c. literature and film. The survey begins with an introduction to key elements of the comical in literature and film, including slapstick, clowning, mime, or stunts. Discussions revolve around the issue of how or whether humor is universally recognizable or whether it is regionally, historically, and culturally defined. To shed light on this difficult question we will consider both historical and geographical settings. In close studies of popular films and literary texts we will examine the characters’ proclivities and discuss their gender-based perspectives as well as the influence of racial, religious or age-related identities. Our weekly readings—which include excerpts from major novels, selected scenes from films as well as short stories--provide us with rich and instructive examples of how eating habits, choice of food, calendrical events (holiday vs. weekday) may be related to the formation and expression of cultural identity. Romantic comedies reveal not only personal preferences and the joy of eating—they also signal collective taste patterns and indicate what kind of fantasies or constraints have governed the daily or festive dietary practices from the early 20th c. on. While the comical is first and foremost represented in time-honored genres such as comedies  or jokes, we will concentrate on the modern tradition in this course. This approach allows us to address the social, political, and cultural issue of multiculturalism and to build bridges between individual text/film and their historical contexts in the German-speaking countries. The emphasis of the course lies on a critical investigation of how cultural identity is related to self-expression and to physical interaction on the page, the stage or the screen.

GERM GU4938,History of Horror Cinema,"As has become very obvious in American culture in the past twenty years or so, horror is having a moment. This is particularly true in American cinema, where horror tends to cost less and earn more for film producers than almost any other subgenre. The rise of horror has also, of course, been affected by the rise of perceived and real threats to public and individual safety—pandemics, government malfeasance, ecological catastrophe, etc. But the recent surge of popularity in horror doesn’t mean it’s a “new” genre; far from it, the horror genre extends as far back in American film history as film itself as a medium. This course will look at the entire history of horror cinema, focusing on American film. We will start before the era of the “talkie” movie, and will move forward, taking exemplary films from each decade, until we reach about 2020. The course will think about genre, subgenre, and formal elements of filmic analysis, and will also consider elements of American history and culture that inform and inflect the more concrete, material elements of film.",,8:40am,9:55am,14303,,W4938-20253-001,,Germanic Languages,GERM,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/GERM/W4938-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20253GERM4938W001,LECTURE

The report indicates that communities and community-based organizations are one of six potential partners in the public health system and that building community-based partnerships is a priority area for improving public health. CBPR is not a method but an approach to research and practice that involves the active collaboration of the potential beneficiaries and recognizes and values the contributions that communities and their leaders can make to new knowledge and to the translation of research findings into public health practice and policy. CBPR is a collaborative approach to research that recognizes the value of equitably involving the intended beneficiaries throughout all phases of research and/or intervention design, implementation, and evaluation.

Ichneutai
, and Thucydides). In addition to close readings of both texts, students will become acquainted with the relevant epic and lyric accounts on which the dramatists draw and will also consider the rich iconography surrounding the central protagonists. Beyond highlighting important commonalities and differences between these two plays, one considered ‘early’, the other ‘late’, the class will also discuss issues of staging, dramaturgy, dance and song, and we will pay particular attention to the different modalities of voice and of chorality (informed by its lyric background) within each text. While the focus will always be on the primary texts, through the assigned secondary reading students will also be introduced to a variety of different critical approaches and methodologies: among them we will be using ideas drawn from the ‘new materialism’, anthropology, the current fields of ‘sound studies’ and animal vocalism, genre-mixing, and dance theory.

HCM_ PS5230,CHANGE MANAGEMENT,"Change is a necessary and constant part of any organization. The change may be expected, or it may be in reaction to unanticipated external and/or internal factors. In fact, organizations that do not change do not last.
  
Change initiatives can be exceedingly complex and disorienting, however. The success of a given changeinitiative often rests on the clarity of vision of an organization’s leaders; an accurate and sensitiveunderstanding of the organization’s culture; the involvement, input and buy-in of multiple internal andexternal stakeholders to the change objectives and process; leaders’ ability to leverage technology tocommunicate and drive change; and an organization’s analytical capabilities to document and measureprogress, and continue to iterate and improve.
  
In light of these requirements, this course seeks to ask: What is the role of the HCM leader in facilitatingchange within an organization? The aims of this course are not abstract. This course will help studentsdevelop skills to support actual organizations (their own and/or others) through change. Lectures, readings,videos, in-class and asynchronous discussions, and assignments will all focus on the practical application ofchange theory and empirical research to real-world organizational contexts.

We will examine the values and attitudes that have influenced beliefs about witchcraft and the supernatural, both historically and in the present day, using both primary and secondary sources. This course will pay specific attention to the role of gender and sexuality in the history of witchcraft, as the vast majority of individuals charged in the witch hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were indeed women. We will also study accusations of witchcraft, breaking down the power dynamics and assumptions at play behind the witch trials, and the impacts of these trials on gender relations in European society. This class will track the intersections of magic and science throughout the early-modern period, and the reconciliation of belief systems during the Enlightenment. We will carry our analysis into the modern period, touching on Victorian spiritualism and mysticism, McCarthyism in the United States, and contemporary goddess worship. We will conclude the semester with an investigation into the role of witchcraft in discussions of gender, race, and sexuality in popular culture.",Dale Booth,11:40am,12:55pm,00038,,X2199-20253-001,History of Witchcraft,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2199-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

How are power relations of class, race and gender embedded in the environment we live in? The class welcomes students from the natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities.

It understands the Cold War as a multi-national and multi-layered conflict, which not only pitted two superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—against one another, but also a plethora of state and non-state actors that framed their actions as part of a larger struggle for the fate of humanity. In Latin America in particular, the idea of socialist revolution posed a significant challenge to both capitalism and United States hegemony. We will pay special attention to revolutionary and counterrevolutionary events in Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua, probing the motives, actions, and influence of local and foreign actors in such events.",Alfonso Salgado,4:10pm,5:25pm,00658,,X2697-20253-001,The Cold War in Latin Ame,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2697-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

HIST BC2920,Urban Healthscapes: A Spatial History of,"This course examines the landscapes of urban public health from the medieval era to the 19th century using spatial analysis. It has two objectives. Thematically, it introduces students to the concept and study of “urban healthscapes” in Europe and the Americas before the age of modern bacteriology. Weekly lectures advance through a sequence of four related themes: (1) medieval and early modern communal, infrastructural, and regulatory spatial practices of public health; (2) urban mortality regimes, epidemics, and societal responses; (3) the relationships between urban form, spatial governance, planning, and public health; and (4) problems of environmental justice, including unequal exposure to health risks and access to health amenities. Methodologically, the course approaches these topics via the lens of historical Geographic Information Systems. In weekly labs, students acquire technical skills of GIS mapping. They learn how to work with spatial data, create GIS maps, conduct spatial analysis, and develop spatial historical arguments and narratives. Labs integrate recently released public hGIS datasets on a variety of cities—such as medieval Bologna and 19th-century New York—directly relevant to the themes covered in lectures. For course assignments, students use these datasets to conduct spatial analyses of urban healthscapes. The course is open to all undergraduates. Previous GIS knowledge is not needed.",Gergely Baics,10:10am,11:25am,00341,,X2920-20253-001,Urban Healthscapes,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X2920-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

Its history, however, is much older, and it encompasses major historical developments such as the formation and global spread of empires, of trade and capitalism, slavery, and migratory movements, as well as environmental and ecological issues. Processes of globalization and deglobalization affect central categories with which to interpret social, political and economic dynamics such as sovereignty, hegemony, and inequality.
  
This course will offer students the critical instruments to discuss globalizing dynamics and how they have affected human societies historically.

The course will begin with an introduction to Galen’s humoral theories of the body that informed the diagnosis and treatment of illness in Europe for centuries. We will look at the role of the body in religious practices in the medieval period, and its role as evidence in the witch trials of the early modern period. We will also look to the framing of sexual difference and consider how these parameters have shaped contemporary gender politics and medical practice. We will trace outbreaks of infectious disease – from the bubonic plague, to syphilis, to cholera– and the implications on the social, cultural, political, and economic structures of everyday life. Students will learn about the professionalization of the medical field, the rise of public health institutions, and the ways in which authorities policed social behavior on the grounds of public health. Together, we will examine the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, and class in the understanding and treatment of the body within society. Students will also be challenged to ground their understanding of social and cultural history in a broader history of the body and embodiment. In doing so, students will examine how ideas surrounding the body change over the course of time, and how we, as historians, can account for and assess such changes.",Dale Booth,2:10pm,4:00pm,00343,,X3108-20253-001,The Body and Society in E,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3108-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

HIST BC3379,"Water Histories: Society, Environment, a","This class explores the relationship between water and society in history. How did water shape human and environmental histories around the globe? On one hand, oceans and rivers affected the characteristics and resources of different civilizations. Throughout history, every community depended on access to water resources, developed local practices of water management, and produced cultural and scientific understandings of “water.” On the other hand, human attempts at regulating water flows aimed at controlling life itself, as water is essential for life. Hydro-power, before being a renewable source energy, required exerting political power over humans and nature alike.
  
Grounded in the interdisciplinary approach of the environmental humanities, this class will explore the politics of water management thanks to a wide range of case studies. Starting with the first environmental history of the Mediterranean in the early modern period, we will focus on the last two centuries to examine the roots of the current environmental crisis. By following the politics of water flows, the class will introduce students to key themes in global environmental history, such as the role of geography, climate, race, energy, labor, technology, cities, animals, diseases, and empires in the transformation of human societies. Finally, the class provides foundational historical knowledge to understand the importance of water in contemporary debates about environmental justice and climate change.",Angelo Caglioti,10:10am,12:00pm,00348,,X3379-20253-001,WATER HISTORIES,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3379-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

HIST BC3770,"African Communities in New York, 1900 to","This class explores the history of voluntary migrations from Africa to the United States over the course of the 20th century. This course is designed as a historical research seminar that is open to students with prior coursework in African Studies, Africana Studies, Race and Ethnic Studies, or History. Thematically the course dwells at a point of intersection between African history, Black History, and Immigration History. 
  
As part of the Barnard Engages curriculum, this class is collaboratively designed with the Harlem-based non-profit organization, African Communities Together.  The aim of this course is to support the mission of ACT by producing a historically grounded digital advocacy project. The mission of ACT is to empower immigrants from Africa and their families to integrate socially, advance economically, and engage civically.  To advance this mission, ACT must confront the reality that in the current political moment new legal, political, and social barriers are being erected to the integration, advancement, and engagement of African immigrants on a daily basis. As immigrants, as Black people, as Africans, and often as women, low-income people, LGBT+ people, and Muslims, African immigrants experience multiple intersecting forms of marginalization. Now more than ever, it is critical that African immigrants be empowered to tell their own stories—not just of persecution and suffering, but of resilience and resistance.",Abosede A George,2:10pm,4:00pm,00882,,X3770-20253-001,AFRICAN COMMUNITIES IN NY,History @Barnard,HIST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abosede_George,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3770-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

HIST BC3978,"Development Economics, Democracy & Revol","After World War II, the question of the development of so-called underdeveloped countries became an international priority. The timing was not casual: the demise of the colonial empires and the birth of new countries propagated the ideals of modernization worldwide. Moreover, in a world divided between two superpowers, the fate of less developed countries became a matter of foreign policy concern in the developed ones. Since then, development has become a major challenge for the contemporary world. The new relevance of the issue has also prompted, in the years after World War II, the birth of a new disciplinary field, namely, development economics, which is increasingly at the core of the economics profession, as demonstrated by the Nobel prizes in Economics to W. Arthur Lewis in 1979, to Amartya Sen in 1998, and to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer in 2019, as well as the work on development of other prominent economists such as Dani Rodrik, William Easterly, Jeffrey Sachs, and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.
  
This seminar will explore the trajectory of the idea of development from World War II to the present, with a particular focus on how it has been discussed within the disciplinary field of development economics. We will discuss how different analyses of development processes—how they can be put in motion, how they evolve, and what are their potential outcomes—have intersected debates about dynamics of social and economic change, how the whole development field has been interpreted alternatively as a progressive endeavour or an ideological construct fostering a neocolonial agenda, and how development policies have been judged to strengthen democratic institutions or, on the contrary, as a mechanism reinforcing domestic and international inequality, to be opposed with revolution.
  
Although the focus of this seminar will be on understanding the history of development rather than shaping its future, graduate students from outside of history (including business, anthropology, political science, economics, human rights, law, sociology, and area studies) are welcomed to register, as this is a topic that would benefit greatly from an interdisciplinary perspective.",Michele Alacevich,9:00am,10:50am,00509,,X3978-20253-001,Dev Econ/Dem/Revolution 2,History @Barnard,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/X3978-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

HIST GR8821,South Asia Partitioned: Art & History,"Does the long history of South Asia reflect only a teleologic march towards the partition of the subcontinent in 1947? What modes and practices, histories and concepts, which emerged in, say, the second millennium alone allow us a glimpse past the divisions, ruptures and conflicts which pre-dominate contemporary political and historical understanding? This graduate seminar takes the longue durée approach to the study of “Partition” by examining illustrated and illuminated epics and histories from the 14th century to the 19th century. This visual and textual production is put in conversation with modern contemporary artists who interrogated, imagined and wrestled with the Partition. Illustrated texts include: the Awadhi Chandayan (14th c.), Pancatantra via Anvar-i Suhayli (15th c.), and Mahabharata via Razmnama (16th c.). Artists include: Zarina Hashmi (1937-2020), Lala Rukh (1948–2017), Shahzia Sikander (b. 1969) and Varunika Saraf (b. 1981).

HIST GU4388,The Holocaust in the USSR,"Following the trials of the immediate postwar, and the 
Historikerstreit 
of the 1980s, the study of the Holocaust has another significant turn with the opening of the Soviet archives beginning in the 1990s. The Holocaust in the USSR expands our knowledge of the catastrophe, situating the latter phases of emblematic extermination camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau against a longer continuum of personalized, individual violence. The “Holocaust by Bullets” as coined by Father Desbois has parallels to other colonial violence and further explains the genocidal process from dehumanization to militarily crafted murder to institutions of extermination. This course specifically addresses the Holocaust in the USSR with a focus on historical research methods, expanded victim groups, testimony, archival research, denial, and rigorous historiographical grounding. Materials include testimonies from the USC Shoah Foundation and Fortunoff Archives, historiographical surveys like Wachsmann’s 
KL 
and
 
Friedländer’s 
Years of Extermination
, and important books with new turns in Holocaust scholarship specifically on the USSR like Lower’s 
Hitler’s Furies
 and Snyder’s

How is law lived on the ground, and how did its subjects think about it and use it for their own purposes?  In this class, we will read recent and significant scholarship in the history of the early American republic (c. 1776-1840) that explores these questions, drawing on the history of the law and legal sources.
  
Although this class will touch on some of the better-known arguments among scholars of legal history, its approach will be more practical than theoretical. Its primary focus will not be on the evolution of American law as a conceptual matter, or on philosophical arguments about the nature of the law. Rather, students in this class will read in order to become better researchers: to learn more about how law 
worked 
in the early American republic, about the institutions through which it operated, about how it changed over time, and how it formed (and was formed by) American society.

HIST GU4708,"Topics in Ottoman History, 1300   1800","The Ottomans ruled Southeast Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Anatolia for nearly half a millennium. The objective of this seminar is to explore the rich and growing literature on the social, cultural, political, and economic history of this bygone empire, whose legacy still persists, in one way or another, in some twenty-five contemporary successor states from the Balkans to the Arabian Peninsula. The seminar is designed to contextualize the Ottoman experiences within the broader structures of global and regional histories during the late-medieval and early modern eras. Each week, we will focus on a particular theme, assess the current state of scholarship on the topic, and reflect upon a specific set of primary sources useful for the study of the issue. The themes we will explore include, but are not limited to, identities and mentalities, governance of the empire and its bureaucracy, the status of minorities and confessional politics, literacy and the use of the public sphere, legal culture and pluralism, the environment, and science and technology. Please be advised that this seminar will avoid the mere chronological narrative of Ottoman political and institutional history, which often recounts the transformation from the 'terror of Europe' to its 'Sick Man.'

It investigates the kinds of knowledge production required to erase these ties and connections, and to produce a vaguely “brown” racial sphere that both homogenizes the Middle East and removes any references to Blackness from its history and societies. Throughout the course, we will probe the memories and legacies of enslavement across the Middle East and Indian Ocean world. How has enslavement and the lives of those enslaved
 
been remembered, defined, written about, and narrated in both academic and non-academic texts? What were the factors that enabled remembering or forgetting these pasts and the people’s lives they controlled? And how do these narratives relate to the questions of race?

Attempting to achieve climate stabilization requires an unprecedented collective effort. If we do not make the effort, the science tells us that we face radical new types of uncertainty and risk.

Themes include the emergence of homosexuality and heterosexuality as categories of experience and identity; the changing relationship between homosexuality and transgenderism; the development of diverse lesbian and gay subcultures and their representation in popular culture; the sources of antigay hostility; religion and sexual science; generational change and everyday life; AIDS; and gay, antigay, feminist, and queer movements.",George Chauncey,11:40am,12:55pm,10349,,W2533-20253-001,,History,HIST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Chauncey,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2533-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,MW,20253HIST2533W001,LECTURE

HIST UN2978,Science and Pseudoscience: Alchemy to AI,"During the 2020 US presidential election and the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, science and “scientific truths” were fiercely contested. This course provides a historical perspective on the issues at stake. The course begins with an historical account of how areas of natural knowledge, such as astrology, alchemy, and “natural magic,” which were central components of an educated person’s view of the world in early modern Europe, became marginalized, while a new philosophy of nature (what we would now call empirical science) came to dominate the discourse of rationality. Historical developments examined in this course out of which this new understanding of nature emerged include the rise of the centralized state, religious reform, and European expansion. The course uses this historical account to show how science and pseudoscience developed in tandem in the period from 1400 to 1800. This historical account equips students to examine contemporary issues of expertise, the social construction of science, pluralism in science, certainty and uncertainty in science, as well as critical engagement with contemporary technologies.",,2:40pm,3:55pm,10168,,W2978-20253-001,Science and Pseudoscience,History,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W2978-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20253HIST2978W001,LECTURE

HIST UN3274,Collapse: The Fall and Afterlife of the,"On Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev ended two things: his tenure as President of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union itself. The following day, Boris Yeltsin entered office as the first president of the Russian Federation, and without delay, began to institute radical economic and social reforms. Under his watch, the country privatized national industry, cut the state budget, and courted foreign multinational businesses. The world most commonly used to describe Russia in the early 1990s is “disappear”: money, jobs, food, and people. The very things that Soviet-style socialism had committed itself to providing for started to vanish as a result of invisible and market forces. At the same time as they were being told to welcome the approaching era of capitalist abundance, ordinary Russians were scrambling to cope with and recover from all that appeared to be suddenly and permanently missing from their pay stubs, kitchen tables, and family photographs.
  
This course will explore what emerged in the spaces left empty after Soviet-style socialism’s demise. The course will be divided into three parts. The first part of the semester will examine the origins of the Soviet Union’s collapse and its breakup into fifteen successor states. Who was Mikhail Gorbachev, and why did the reforms instituted as part of 
glasnost
 and 
perestroika 
fail to revitalize the Soviet system? How did citizens - elites and average people alike - from Russia, the Soviet republics, and satellite states witness the collapse, and how did they manage the immediate transition to capitalism? The second part of the semester will survey the political, economic, and social processes that followed the collapse. How did former Soviet citizens reintegrate themselves in the new economies, political movements, and social structures that emerged in the Russian Federation under Yeltsin? In what ways did privatization and the arrival of foreign capital shape labor practices, consumer habits, the natural and built environment, and forms of cultural expression? What forms did nationalist movements in the former republics and and Warsaw Pact countries take? Finally, the third part of the course will focus on Putin’s ascendancy to the presidency and its consequences for Russian citizens at home and Russia’s image abroad. We will consider the role that memory and myth play in the formation of a “United Russian” consciousness, the costs and benefits of life in Putin’s Russia, and the",Yana Skorobogatov,2:10pm,4:00pm,11500,,W3274-20253-001,Collapse of Soviet Union,History,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W3274-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253HIST3274W001,SEMINAR

The course will trace critical aspects of these two major, interconnected historical phenomena with an eye to how specific cases either manifested or troubled broader trends across various slaveholding societies. The first half of the course addresses the history of slavery and the second half pertains to experiences in emancipation. However, since the abolition of slavery occurs at different moments in various areas of the Atlantic World, the course will adhere to a more thematic and less chronological structure, in its examination of the multiple avenues to freedom available in various regions. Weekly units will approach major themes relevant to both slavery and emancipation, such as racial epistemologies among slaveowners/employers, labor regimes in slave and free societies, cultural innovations among slave and freed communities, gendered discourses and sexual relations within slave and free communities, and slaves’ and free people’s resistance to domination. The goal of this course is to broaden students’ comprehension of the history of slavery and freedom, and to promote an understanding of the transition from slavery to freedom in the Americas as creating both continuities and ruptures in the structure and practices of the various societies concerned.",Natasha J Lightfoot,2:10pm,4:00pm,10358,,W3928-20253-001,SLAVERY/ABOLITION-ATLANTC,History,HIST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HIST/W3928-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,T,20253HIST3928W001,SEMINAR

HPMN P8214,Law & Policy: Mass Incarceration in the,"From 1970 until today, America’s prison and jail population has increased sevenfold, from some 300,000 to around 2.2 million adults and children behind bars.  Accounting for less than 5 percent of the world’s inhabitants, but about 25 percent of the world’s incarcerated inhabitants, the United States is the most incarcerating society in human history.  The U.S. federal and state governments imprison more people and at higher rates than do any other governments on the planet, and they do so today more than they did at any other period in American history.  
This astounding amount of human confinement (commonly called “mass incarceration”) disproportionately impacts the polity’s poorest communities of color—especially young Black males—which suffer from chronic conditions and infectious disease; face higher mortality rates; and experience, because of criminal records, less opportunity to secure gainful employment, stable housing, access to safety net programs, and education.  Female incarceration over the past few decades has grown at twice the rate of male incarceration, and black women, specifically, are twice as likely as white women to serve time.  Imprisonment exposes people to a wide range of circumstances proving detrimental to long-term physical and mental health, like inadequate sanitation, poor ventilation, and solitary confinement.  And most formerly incarcerated people return to their communities with deep wounds and new traumas resulting from incarcerated life and from isolation through long separations from families and social supports.
This course sits at the intersection of public health, policy, and law.  The course will explore the full spectrum of causes and costs of mass incarceration as a public health crisis.  This course will examine how exposures to different structures of the American criminal punishment apparatus (e.g., law enforcement, jail, prison, or detention centers, community supervision) shape the health of people, families, and society.  Observing mass incarceration as an epidemic, this course will adopt a useful public-health model of prevention to contemplate a concerted approach consisting of primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies for unwinding mass human imprisonment while advancing enhanced public health for the nation’s most disempowered members.  This course will pay special attention to acutely at-risk populations, including detained youth and youth of incarcerated adults, pregnant incarcerated people, and the elderly.

HROH GR5555,"Oral History & Justice: Memory, Power, a","This course will explore the ethics and politics of using oral history methods for documenting injustice, oppression, and human rights issues. The course is open to graduate students of oral history, human rights, journalism, and related fields; no prior experience with oral history interviewing is required. Oral history can be a powerful means of documenting oppression, human rights abuses, and crisis “from the bottom up” and facilitating the understanding and possible transformation of conditions of injustice. It can open the space for people and narratives that have been marginalized to challenge official narratives and complicate narrow accounts of injustice and crisis. The course will first explore what is distinct about oral history as a response to harm or injustice, comparing it to more familiar forms of testimony and narrative used within the realm of human rights, social justice organizations and courts of law. With its commitment to life narrative interviews and archival preservation, oral history situates injustice within the broader context of a life, a historical trajectory, and a political and cultural setting. Weaving together conceptual and practical approaches, we will examine different potential goals of oral history, such as documenting the experiences of people who have been marginalized; seeking justice; fostering dialogue and healing; and/or supporting activism and advocacy. The course covers interviewing skills and project planning specifically for oral history projects about injustice and human rights, and explores various dimensions of how power, politics, and ethics come into play — how politics and power shape the way a narrative is heard; the challenges of realizing ideals of collaboration and shared authority amid uneven power dynamics; contending with the effects of trauma on both narrators and interviewers; and critical considerations for projects produced with activist and advocacy aims.

HRTS GU4011,Indigenous Rights and Settler Colonialis,"Course Description
  
This interdisciplinary course explores both the rights of Indigenous people in settler colonies as well as the complex historical and theoretical relationship between human rights and settler colonialism. We will pursue three lines of inquiry. The first critically explores how central political concepts of the international state system—sovereignty, property, territory, self-determination—entwine the histories of settler colonialism and human rights. The second charts the rise and mechanisms of the international Indigenous rights movement, in particular its activity at the United Nations leading to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, and its contributions to ongoing debates on environmental and climate justice, group rights, natural resources and territorial autonomy, and cultural rights. The third unit interrogates settler state responses to the movement for Indigenous human rights, such as cooptation, recognition, and apology.
  
Through readings drawn from history, ethnography, political and critical theory, international relations, Native studies, law, and documents produced by intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, we will explore and deepen the tensions between human rights as a theory and practice and the political lives and aspirations of Indigenous peoples and activists. What technologies of rule—such as residential school systems and property law—do settler colonial states deploy to dispossess Indigenous peoples? How have Indigenous peoples used the international human rights regime to mobilize against such dispossession? How have these states resisted the global Indigenous rights movement? And can the human rights regime, rooted in the international state system, meaningfully contribute to anticolonial movements in liberal settler colonies? While we will touch on settler colonialism as it manifests around the globe, the course’s geographical focus will be on North America.
  
Course objectives
  
Throughout this course, you will:
  
  
Develop a historically-informed understanding of both international indigenous rights and settler colonialism as idea, practice, institution, and discourse;
  
Place the literature on human rights and settler colonialism into critical conversation in order to deepen existing conceptual problems and generate new ones;
  
Identify the main arguments in theoretical texts, legal and policy documents, and public debates",Timothy Wyman-McCarthy,12:10pm,2:00pm,10306,,W4011-20253-001,Indig Rts Settler Colonia,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/W4011-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253HRTS4011W001,SEMINAR

Through a multidisciplinary approach, the course evaluates the sociological, economic, and cultural factors driving populist surges, as well as their consequences for civic culture, governance, and international relations. Students will analyze the implications of populism for human rights in the context of migration, authoritarianism, freedom of speech, minorities, and challenges to international and regional courts and institutions. The course will investigate both left-wing and right-wing populist movements, considering the threat they pose to human rights, their pursuit of socio-economic rights through the redistribution of wealth, and how the human rights project could and is being rethought in light of these challenges and opportunities.",Timothy Wyman-McCarthy,4:10pm,6:40pm,10307,,W4260-20253-001,Human Rights & Populism,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/W4260-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253HRTS4260W001,SEMINAR
HRTS GU4500,SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS,"The course addresses selected issues in the protection of socio-economic rights in an international and comparative perspective. Socio-economic rights have emerged from the margins into the mainstream of human rights. The course will take this status as its starting point and examine the human rights to housing, food, water, health and sanitation in depth. We will explore conceptual issues through the lens of specific rights which will help us ground these principles and ideas in concrete cases. We will discuss developments on socioeconomic rights and examine their relevance in the United States as well as selected other countries, particularly those with progressive legislation, policies and jurisprudence. What is the meaning and scope of the rights to housing, food, water, health and sanitation? What is the impact of discrimination and inequalities on the enjoyment of socio-economic rights? How can governments be held accountable for the realization of human rights? What machinery is there at the international level to ensure that the rights are protected, respected and fulfilled? How can this machinery be enhanced? How can judicial, quasijudicial, administrative and political mechanisms be used at the domestic level? What is the role of different actors in the context of human rights, the role of States and individuals, but also (powerful) non-State actors and civil society? How have activists and policymakers responded to challenges?

HRTS GU4600,HUMAN RIGHTS IN ANTHROPOCENE,"In August 2016, a working group of the International Geological Congress voted to acknowledge a new geological epoch, following 11,700 years of the Holocene, and that it would be called The Anthropocene. The announcement indicated a new era in the earth’s chronology marked by the consequences of human activity on the planet’s ecosystems. Closely related to discussions of sustainability, investigations into the Anthropocene tend to focus on environmental and ecological issues while ignoring its social justice dimensions. This course will investigate how Human Rights has and will be impacted by the Anthropocene, with special attention paid to the human dimensions and consequences of anthropogenic change. Do new and troubling revelations about anthropogenic mistreatment of the earth and its resources modify or amplify the kinds of responsibilities that govern activity between individuals and communities? How do we scale the human response from the urban, to the periurban, to the rural? How must the study of Human Rights evolve to address violence and mistreatment associated not just among humans but also amid human habitats? What sorts of juridical changes must occur to recognize and respond to new manifestations of social injustice that relate directly to consequences of anthropogenic changes to the Earth system? Topics will include discussions of the Environmental Justice movement, agribusiness, access to (and allocation of) natural resources, population growth; its global impact, advocacy for stronger and more accountability through environmental legal change, biodiversity in urban environments, and the growing category of environmental refugees.",Noah B Chasin,10:10am,12:00pm,10316,,W4600-20253-001,HUMAN RIGHTS IN ANTHROPOC,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/W4600-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253HRTS4600W001,SEMINAR

HRTS GU4950,HUMAN RIGHTS & HUMAN WRONGS,"Prerequisites: the instructors permission. Please e-mail the instructor at bc14@columbia.edu. This course will examine the tension between two contradictory trends in world politics. On the one hand, we have emerged from a century that has seen some of the most brutal practices ever perpetrated by states against their populations in the form of genocide, systematic torture, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Many of these abuses occurred after the Holocaust, even though the mantra never again was viewed by many as a pledge never to allow a repeat of these practices. Events in the new century suggest that these trends will not end anytime soon. At the same time, since the middle of the twentieth century, for the first time in human history there has been a growing global consensus that all individuals are entitled to at least some level of protection from abuse by their governments. This concept of human rights has been institutionalized through international law, diplomacy, international discourse, transnational activism, and the foreign policies of many states. Over the past two decades, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international tribunals have gone further than any institutions in human history to try to stem state abuses. This seminar will try to make sense of these contradictions.",Bruce L Cronin,2:10pm,4:00pm,10314,,G4950-20253-001,HUMAN RIGHTS & HUMAN WRON,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/G4950-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253HRTS4950G001,SEMINAR

In this course, we will examine research discerning, movements challenging, and the adjudication, and/or lack thereof, of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in several major categories traversing spatial, temporal, and ideological contexts, including: reproductive rights and health; trafficking and migration; and disaster and pandemics. It is critical to: interrogate the ideologies that drive and sustain GBV; examine in detail the harm it presents to human beings; explore what can be done to protect the security of those experiencing GBV; and to think about measures of prevention to guard additional human beings from experiencing it. The heart of the course will involve an intersectional analysis of specific case studies; highlighting the GBV associated with each case; examining the impact of GBV on human rights; and how GBV has been addressed in society.

HRTS GU4970,"Refugees, Citizenship, Migration","This interdisciplinary course grapples with nation-states and cities at its margins, exploring the exclusions, oppositions, silences and, in particular, the 'Others' or 'in-betweens' of the nation-state as an organizing tool. ‘Illegal migrants’, ‘refugees’, ‘asylum seekers’, ‘exiles’, ‘nomads’, ‘aliens’, and other ‘Others’: these are all in-between figures, exceptions to a political order defined by membership in the city, borders, sovereignty and nation-states. In their very existence, they represent a challenge to this political order, as social and political theorists have long recognized. This seminar explores the dynamics, contradictions and politics surrounding nation-states and their Others with particular attention to the responses to them on the part of ostensibly liberal-democratic states. We examine the relationship between citizenship, statelessness, refugee-hood and migration as exceptions to a political order defined by membership in the city, borders, sovereignty and nation-states. Students will engage with film, fiction, visual animations and displacement maps to examine key theoretical and critical interventions by scholars who examine nation-states and cities at their margins. To this end, participants will examine key theoretical interventions by Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Giorgio Agamben alongside scholars who have grappled with, contested, and developed their ideas, such as Étienne Balibar, Didier Bigo, Jacques Rancière, and Seyla Benhabib. With these texts, the participants will attempt to explore non-national or post-national alternatives to the nation-state and citizenship as a tool for planning and organization of people and space.
  
Taken together, this course provides an alternative to conventional scholarship on this subject. It engages with and provides an alternative to the mainstream literature to take for granted the inclusive and integrative character of nation-states and its respective memberships in the form of refugees, citizens and migrants. 
At first glance, the course may appear highly theoretical, but not to worry—we will move slowly through the texts and concepts together. The instructor will also ensure that we apply the ideas discussed in class to concrete and tangible case studies with examples given to enable easier access and collective learning.",Shourideh Molavi,10:10am,12:00pm,10241,,W4970-20253-001,Refugees Citizenship Migr,Institute for Study of Human Rights,HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/W4970-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20253HRTS4970W001,SEMINAR

Mass incarceration remains one of the most pressing human rights issues in the United States. This course explores what has been done, is being done, and can be done to rethink incarceration in the U.S. and to provoke change.
 We will actively engage with prominent activists at Columbia who will visit some classes during the second half of the semester.
  
Incarcerated people in the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn (a maximum-security federal prison) and in Rikers Island (a mixed security New York State detention center) regularly claim to be tortured (and show apparent evidence of torture), and yet their claims are rarely thoroughly examined. There has never been real accountability. Compare the New York cases to those in Chicago. From 1972 to 1991, former Chicago police commander Jon Burge and white detectives under his command systematically tortured at least 117 Black people in police custody. In May 2015, 43 years after clear evidence of torture, Chicago became the first municipality in the U.S. to provide reparations to those harmed by racially-motivated law enforcement violence, passing legislation for survivors of the Burge police torture regime.

HRTS UN3934,Seeking Sanctuary in New York City,"In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum – the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that of a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city’s long history of refuge? 
  
This course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection.
  
This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.",Jennifer Trowbridge,10:10am,12:00pm,00429,,V3934-20253-001,Seeking Sanctuary in New,Human Rights (HRTB),HRTS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HRTS/V3934-20253-001/,To be announced,,,5,,WF,20253HRTS3934V001,SEMINAR

The course will be tailored to students’ interests, disciplinary backgrounds and research areas. The specific topics students will research and the methods they will employ will determine the substantive focus of readings. During the course we will ask the following questions: ‘what is human rights research?, how do you carry out research in an interdisciplinary field?, what distinguishes academic research from applied research and advocacy? While answering these questions, you will become familiar with the literature on human rights methodologies, and you will engage in analysis and critical assessment of important human rights research literature. In addition, the course gives a practical approach to research methodology. You will learn about a diverse set of methodologies, such as interviewing and focus groups, archival research, ethnographic and participant observation, interviewing focus groups, conducting online research; interpretive and non-empirical methods and basic quantitative methodologies to be employed in the study of human rights. As you learn about different methodological approaches, you will develop your own research project. Scholars and practitioners in the field of human rights research will present their work and engage in discussions with students about their own research, challenges, successes and publication venues.

Scholarly and popular histories have underscored the ways 1968 was a watershed moment in the history of the 20th century. Although the protest is one of the touchstone events from the year and the decade, reliable historical treatment is still lacking. This class encourages students to examine and craft histories of the university and the surrounding community in this period. Designed to work in tandem with the “Columbia and Slavery” course, this course is a public-facing seminar designed to empower students to open up a discussion of all the issues connected with the protests, its global, national, and local context, and its aftermath. The course aims to raise questions, elicit curiosity, and encourage students and those interested in Columbia and Morningside Heights history to investigate one of the most important events to take place in the university’s history. The recent 50th anniversary of those events, and the availability of new sources & publications on the protests, have presented opportunities to prompt fresh answers to old questions: What were the factors that led to the protests? How did student and community mobilization shape, and were shaped by, national and international forces? What are the local, national, and international legacies of Columbia 1968? The recent graduate student strike is a very tangible legacy of the protests. This seminar is part of an on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with such questions and to share our findings with the Columbia community and beyond.  Working independently, students will define and pursue individual research projects.  Working together, the class will create digital visualizationsof these projects.
  
 
  
Course Objectives:
  
1.     To explore, document, and contextualize the Columbia/Morningside Heights protests of 1968.
  
2.     To practice the “historian’s craft” by conducting research, analyzing primary material, and making coherent arguments based on an interrogation of evidence.

HUMA BC1111,A BARNARD EDUCATION AT WORK,"Per its mission statement, “Barnard College aims to provide the highest-quality liberal arts
 education to promising and high-achieving young women… They graduate prepared to lead
 lives that are professionally satisfying and successful, personally fulfilling, and enriched by a love
 of learning.” This course finds its roots in the connection posited here, between undergraduate
 study and professional life. Students will be asked to revisit a foundational text they have
 encountered in their major, and use it as a mode of exploration and reflection on an internship.
 They will consider how the text’s themes and ideas can be reinterpreted and recontextualized in
 the working world, and think about what practical, moral, political, aesthetic and personal
 insights it affords. More broadly, students will be prompted to consider the relationship of the
 liberal arts degree (which purports to prepare students for no particular career) to their chosen
 career path. This course will further hone the critical thinking and writing skills that are
 translatable to any profession, and enables a Barnard student to put into practice the
 complexities they have learned in the classroom, by encouraging them to analyze the
 professional world from different perspectives, and in the context of other ideas and traditions.
 The text will be selected from a list provided by the student’s major department, and will be
 subject to approval from the course instructor.
 On a weekly basis, in this discussion-based class, the student shares their ideas about their text
 and how it relates to their internship. They respond to and engage with their classmates. They
 are required to spend about two hours with their text per week. They are also required to
 create a three to five minute presentation, to be shared with the full group. The group is also
 responsible for providing feedback on the presentation. The presentation ultimately evolves
 into a final paper of 8-10 pages that explores the line of inquiry from their text as it is
 instantiated in their work experience. Students are graded on their discussion (40%),
 presentation (25%), and final paper (35%).",Erica A Siegel,8:40am,9:55am,00992,,X1111-20253-001,A BARNARD EDUCATION AT WO,Barnard College,HUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/HUMA/X1111-20253-001/,To be announced,,,1,,W,20253HUMA1111X001,SEMINAR

What is unusual about foreign exchange is that although it can rightfully claim to be the largest of all financial markets, it remains an area where very few have any meaningful experience. Virtually everyone has traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Comparatively few individuals have ever traded foreign exchange. In part that is because foreign exchange is an interbank market. Ironically the foreign exchange markets may be the best place to trade derivatives and to invent new derivatives—given the massive two-way flow of trading that goes through bank dealing rooms virtually 24 hours a day. And most of that is transacted at razor-thin margins, at least comparatively speaking, a fact that makes the foreign exchange market an ideal platform for derivatives.

IKNS PS5300,FOUNDATIONS FOR THE KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN ORG,"Note: This course starts with a multi-day, on-campus Residency in late Aug./early Sept. and continues online thereafter. 
  
Knowledge-driven organizations increasingly dominate the economy. What are their attributes? What vision and strategy guides their development? How are they designed? What are the jobs necessary for this new workplace? This course has been designed to give students a grounding that will be important for their future working career. It will focus on how the global economy and all its subsequent ramifications has evolved from a predominantly industrial base to one based on knowledge.
  
The Foundations course will begin by giving students a historical perspective as to how the ""knowledge"" economy specifically came about. We will be using historical and economic data and models which offer a clear understanding as to how the global economy and organizations evolved into their current state-where value is produced by knowledge and ideas significantly more than the earlier industrial processes and operations. 
  
The course will then present detailed and comprehensive treatments of how societies, organizations and individual lives have been changed due to this great shift in the factors of production. The course will also focus on how networks, communities and practices work and have evolved to focus more on knowledge production and transfer than on the more industrial factors of production such as land, labor and capital. In addition, the course will examine the critical role of intangibles such as culture, trust and missions in the workings of organizations in this new era. Insights from anthropology, psychology and sociology as well as economics will be incorporated into the course curriculum.
  
A complex and comprehensive case study on NASA and their knowledge operations will be one of the key learning tools for this course as it proceeds.",Edward J Hoffman,,,12973,,K5300-20253-H01,FOUND.

IKNS PS5336,LEADING COLLABORATION,"This course is about leading boundary-spanning coalitions. An old African proverb tells us that, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" While this advice is especially relevant in our interconnected 21st-century world, we have learned that working together is not always easy to do well.
  
“Collaboration at Scale: Leading Boundary-Spanning Coalitions” takes the study of collaboration into an even wider realm by examining the potential and complexity of large-scale, cross-organizational collaboration, and how to lead it.
  
The concept of scalability is common in the business world and this course demonstrates what it takes to make collaboration scalable and suitable for a variety of challenging contexts larger than a single organization. Inherent in the concept of scalability are the notions of ""appropriate scale"" and also ""at scale."" Both of these notions raise valid questions that we will address in this course. (Though our interpretations of scale have evolved with the advent of social media, specific technology selection is not the focus of the course.)
  
Students will learn the characteristics, conditions and dynamics of various large-scale collaborations, as well as how to design and lead them effectively. Course materials will be drawn from the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. Using a balance of practice and theory of networks and large system facilitation, students will demonstrate their mastery of course materials through an assignment in which they diagnose and (re)design a “collaboration at scale.” This could be in the business, scientific, religious, political, or humanitarian domains.",Blake Dicosola,6:10pm,8:00pm,12974,,K5336-20253-001,,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5336-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

IKNS PS5991,LEADING LARGE COMPLEX PROJECTS,"Project management has been important to many types of missions, projects, and activities for many years; however, it has been especially critical to the success of large complex projects across decades and centuries.  Large complex projects span the globe across all industries and sectors. They also span concepts, product design, development, manufacturing, operations, and logistics, etc. Products may include hardware, software, services, product support, systems, and systems of systems, etc.
  
The primary focus of this course will be around project leadership as projects are planned and executed (project management).  The course will start by recognizing the need and benefits of project management for large complex global projects, explore characteristics of project managers, and study the commonality and differences in types of projects.  The course will continue with understanding the essential capabilities of project management, and analyze the variations in project lifecycles. The course will address managing risk throughout the project lifecycle, controls, and performance measurement, and maximizing the use of knowledge.  Lastly, the course will visualize the future of projects and project management structure and core capabilities.
  
Our fundamental goal is to better prepare leaders for large complex global projects.  This will be gained via readings; real-world case studies; and study, research, analysis, and exploration by the students.  Therefore, the course will require students to engage in reflection, discussion, activities, and assignments aimed at personal unlearning and learning.  The assignment and class discussions will be quite provocative to drive maximum learning.",Gregory Robinson,6:10pm,8:00pm,12979,,K5991-20253-D01,LEADING LARGE COMPLEX PRO,Information & Knowledge Strat,IKNS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IKNS/K5991-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Architecture

An independent study course allows a student to work one-on-one with a faculty member to gain & contribute new insight into the discipline of Knowledge Management.
  
Topic/objective
: The topic is chosen by the student as long as it falls within the general realm of Knowledge Management or its specific content areas in the IKNS curriculum, such as IT systems, knowledge organizing systems, data repositories, business data analytics including machine learning & AI, learning processes, collaboration, dialogue, team & project management, transformational leadership, change management, digital transformation, or digital product innovation. The course will therefore serve the dual purpose of allowing a student to pursue their own intellectual curiosity & to make a contribution to the wider discipline of Knowledge Management. In addition, students will deepen their understanding of the content they acquired in other courses, by applying this content to the specific topic chosen for the Independent Study.

IMGT PS5100,"PRODUCT, PRICING & DISTRIBUTION","The insurance business is an outward facing business built around selling products to individual and business consumers. Therefore, insurance service providers, like all sophisticated consumer-driven businesses, must carefully and constantly assess their markets and strategies to remain relevant in a highly competitive environment.  From consumer data analytics, to proper risk pricing, to efficient distribution channels, to navigating social media, to managing the highly regulated nature of insurance sales and distribution, insurance providers operate in a highly competitive environment that rewards discipline as well as innovation.  Successful companies identify and make tough decisions to correct underperforming parts of their portfolios and they temper their approaches to new products where loss costs and pricing requirements are uncertain.  They innovate by thinking first about new and evolving loss exposures their customers face and develop insurance products and services that respond.  They focus on the client experience through the entire insurance process and create specialized/differentiated products and services to either avoid commoditization or leverage it, depending on the needs of that market and the strengths of that insurer.
  
The focus of this core course, in MSIM’s Insurance Rotation area of study, will include the history and the evolution of the insurance industry across the three main insurance sectors, i.e. property/casualty, life and health.  The course will address factors that drive company investment in and/or withdrawal from specific products and markets and the complexities around developing, pricing and selling a product for which costs are determined only after claims have been paid – something that often occurs many years after the policy was sold.   The course will consider how providers are expanding beyond traditional products into related services and how technology is increasing innovation around product design and marketing.",Louis Weltmann,,,11672,,K5100-20253-D01,"PRODUCT, PRICING & DISTRB",Insurance Management,IMGT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/IMGT/K5100-20253-D01/,,On-Line Only,Professional Studies,3,,,20253IMGT5100KD01,LECTURE

This class tries to answer this question by focusing on three great historians and political philosophers of the fifteenth and sixteenth century: Leonardo Bruni, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Francesco Guicciardini. Analyzing their local and peninsular histories, we will learn how Renaissance scholars read, learned from, and rewrote Greek and especially Roman History. We will dive into Bruni’s reading of Florence’s distant and recent past, including historical events discussed in Dante’s 
Divine Comedy
. Also, we will learn how Machiavelli transformed his reading of Livy in a laboratory to understand the tragic events of Renaissance Italy, and how Guicciardini narrates and analyzes contemporary Italian history. Dialoguing with Renaissance Historians, we will learn how creative and problematic is the reading of the past for the understanding of the present. We will discuss the many functions of History and reflect upon big ideas such as fortune, virtue, tyranny, freedom, and truth.

UN3333: This course, entirely taught in Italian, introduces you to Medieval and early modern Italian literature. It will give you the opportunity to test your ability as a close-reader and discover unusual and fascinating texts that tell us about the polycentric richness of the Italian peninsula. We will read poems, tales, letters, fiction and non-fiction, travel writings and political pamphlets. The great “Three Crowns” - Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio - as well as renowned Renaissance authors such as Ludovico Ariosto and Niccolò Machiavelli, will show us the main path to discover Italian masterpieces and understand the European Renaissance. But we will also explore China with Marco Polo and the secrets of the Medieval soul diving into the mystical poems by Jacopone da Todi. We will study parody and laughter through the “poesia giocosa” (parodic poetry) by Cecco Angiolieri and the legacy of Humanism through the letters of Poggio Bracciolini. This first overview will allow you to explore Italian literature from its complex and multicultural beginnings to its diffusion across Europe during the Renaissance.",Steven J Baker,11:40am,12:55pm,11467,,V3333-20253-001,INTRO TO ITALIAN LITERATU,Italian,ITAL,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/ITAL/V3333-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,"ITAL UN2102

Beginning with artistic influences from abroad and culminating with native self-examinations, this course will provide a survey of Israeli film history, recurring foci of Israeli cinema, and introductions to influential filmmakers from early director and impresario Menahem Golan to Orthodox writer/director Rama Burshtein.
  
Each class meeting will include a complete screening of an Israeli feature film, as well as clips of related works. Readings will include critical essays and histories which elaborate on in-class screenings and cover additional topics and films. Written assignments will be three analytical essays which will encourage critical thinking, close analysis of films, and independent research beyond the materials presented in class.
  
All readings are in English. All feature films and film clips are in Hebrew (some include Arabic), and will be presented with English subtitles.

JWST GU4158,Zionist Thought: Center and Periphery,"In this course, students will learn about some of the many manifestations of Zionist thought and organizing from the nineteenth century to the present day. The term “Zionism” is much-debated, but usually with little direct reference to its myriad meanings over time and space. The priorities, concerns, and ideas of Zionists in 1940s Algeria might differ greatly from contemporaneous Egyptian Zionist circles. On the other hand, twenty-first century American Zionists might have more in common with 1910s Ottomanists than one would expect.
  
Each week, we will explore a different region of the world, examining Zionism in the Ottoman Empire, ‘Iraq, Iran, India, Yemen, ‘Aden, Europe, North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, and Egypt), Sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Nigeria), South America, the United States, and Israel.

The course will start with discussions regarding the origins of the modern social sciences and the disputes about the nature of social science knowledge. In the next section it will focus on definitions and debates about the concept of modernity. It will go on to analyses of some fundamental concepts used in modern social and historical analyses: concepts of social action, political concepts like state, power, hegemony, democracy, nationalism; economic concepts like the economy, labor, market, capitalism, and related concepts of secularity/secularism, representation, and identity. The teaching will be primarily through close reading of set texts, followed by a discussion.

MDES GR6625,Camera in the Tropics,"COURSE DESCRIPTION
  
This graduate seminar situates the history of photography within the history of colonial productions of tropicality, and the concomitant occupation of tropical places. Specific regimes of vision accompanied the European conquest of peoples and lands, undergirded the racialization of bodies, and colluded in epistemic binaries of centers and peripheries. At the same time, modern visual media did not possess an intrinsically “colonial gaze.” Rather, many of the same apparatuses of seeing and representation proved to be powerful tools in the assertion of minoritized selves, be it in fugitive , playful, or explicitly confrontational forms. Our focus will be on 19th -20th century lens-based image production, particularly photography. Each week we will acquaint ourselves with concepts and methods that will help us read images, situate current decolonial debates in visual studies within older foundational debates on vision and visuality, and read key texts in historiography. Weekly readings are curated as per a spatial logic, retracing the itineraries of colonial adventurism and control: from the ship to the island, the plantation, the prison, and the laboratory. This seminar is designed mainly for doctoral students; Masters students can join with instructor permission.
  
LEARNING OUTCOMES
  
• Familiarity with foundational debates in photography studies.
  
• Ability to articulate the relationship between a history of vision, the production of space, and the epistemic techniques of colonialism.
  
• A comparative history of colonized islands and archipelagoes construed as “tropical.”
  
• Methods in postcolonial, anti-colonial, and decolonial reading of texts and images.",Debashree Mukherjee,2:10pm,4:00pm,13613,,G6625-20253-001,,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/G6625-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

MDES GR8008,DISSERTATION COLLOQUIUM,"The dissertation colloquium is a non-credit course open to MESAAS doctoral students who have completed the M.Phil. degree. It provides a forum in which the entire community of dissertation writers meets, bridging the departments different fields and regions of research. It complements workshops outside the department focused on one area or theme. Through an encounter with the diversity of research underway in MESAAS, participants learn to engage with work anchored in different regions and disciplines and discover or develop what is common in the departments post-disciplinary methods of inquiry. Since the community is relatively small, it is expected that all post-M.Phil. students in residence will join the colloquium. Post M.Phil. students from other departments may request permission to join the colloquium, but places for non-MESAAS students will be limited. The colloquium convenes every semester, meeting once every two weeks. Each meeting is devoted to the discussion of one or two pre-circulated pieces of work (a draft prospectus or dissertation chapter). Every participant contributes at least one piece of work each year.",Gil Hochberg,,,10142,,G8008-20253-001,,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Z._Hochberg,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/G8008-20253-001/,,In-Person,,0,,,20253MDES8008G001,COLLOQUIA
MDES GR8280,STDY GEN/SEXUALITY-ARAB WORLD,"This course aims to familiarize graduate students with the different methods and approaches that US and European scholars have used to study gender and sexuality in other societies generally, and the way they study them in the context of the Arab World specifically. The course will also explore how Arab scholars have also studied their own societies. We will survey these different approaches, both theoretical and empirical, outlining their methodological difficulties and limitations. Readings will consist of theoretical elaborations of these difficulties and the methodological and empirical critiques that the field itself has generated in order to elaborate how gender and sexuality in the Arab World have been studied, or more accurately, not studied, and how many of these methodological pitfalls can be avoided.",Joseph A Massad,4:10pm,6:00pm,10156,,G8280-20253-001,STDY GEN/SEXUALITY-ARAB W,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Massad,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/G8280-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

MDES UN1003,Premodern Islamic Worlds,"This course introduces the Islamic world from the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad (d. 632) to 1500 CE. The Islamic world stretches across a remarkable geographical expanse from modern Spain and Senegal in the west to the north of modern India in the east. Telling one cohesive story out of many histories is therefore challenging, even if we had a full lifetime to devote to it. We cannot include everything and, as with every complicated story worth knowing, what we choose to exclude is important. This semester, we bypass some of the traditional narratives of political and military history, which privilege the rise and fall of dynasties, the rule of great men, and the clashes of armies. We will still organize along political lines, but the focus of our conversations will be the incredible diversity of the various communities in the Islamic world. We approach these histories through primary sources— poems, coins, buildings, etc.—that we will read together in every class meeting. Our goal will be to situate each source in the political, cultural, and religious contexts of its production. This approach will allow us to appreciate premodern Islamic worlds through the centuries.
  
Through the assignments and conversations in class and section, students will
  
  
Explore the diversity of premodern Islam;
  
Analyze primary sources produced in the Islamic world before 1500, both individually and as a class;
  
Engage with modern scholarship about Islam in India and Central Asia; the Middle East; North, West, and East Africa; and Southern Europe;

MDES UN3254,Colonial Fascism & Revolutionary Violenc,"In this course, we will approach Fanon’s question through our understanding of violence as it was
 invented and deployed from the heart of empire into the colonies. What is fascism and how was it
 linked to colonialism, if at all? In what ways were they dependent on each other to conceive a
 certain world order, particularly between World War I and II? In other words, how did fascist
 visions and colonial practices from the imperial core import repressive structures of violence into
 the colonies, and then export those methods of control back into the metropole as a perpetual
 renewable source of power?
 This course examines the Mediterranean as a site of violence and a theater of “fire and blood,” in
 which the inextricable and dialogical bond between colonialism and fascism are tied through
 mythologies, discourses, institutions, and of course, revolution. In so doing, we interrogate
 Tunisian writer Albert Memmi’s critical intervention of “colonial fascism” that shapes the
 confrontations between metropole and colony as an intricate network shaping the contours of the
 Mediterranean and renewing itself through violence. It also focuses on the rhetoric undergirding
 colonial and fascist discourses, and the counterinsurgent and resistance strategies that, in turn,
 challenge these hegemonies. By situating this particular Mediterranean narrative within the
 broader colonial discourse, the course encourages critical reflection on the enduring legacies of
 imperial power that informs the region’s historical trajectories",Maryam Siddiqui,2:10pm,4:00pm,13912,,W3254-20253-001,Colonial Fascism & Revolu,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W3254-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253MDES3254W001,SEMINAR

MDES UN3960,HONORS THESIS SEMINAR PART 1,"Prerequisites: minimum GPA of 3.5 in MESAAS courses. The MESAAS honors seminar offers students the opportunity to undertake a sustained research project under close faculty supervision. The DUS advises on general issues of project design, format, approach, general research methodologies, and timetable. In addition, students work with an individual advisor who has expertise in the area of the thesis and can advise on the specifics of method and content. The thesis will be jointly evaluated by the adviser, the DUS, and the honors thesis TA. The DUS will lead students through a variety of exercises that are directly geared to facilitating the thesis. Students build their research, interpretive, and writing skills; discuss methodological approaches; write an annotated bibliography; learn to give constructive feedback to peers and respond to feedback effectively. The final product is a polished research paper in the range of 40-60 pages. Please note: This is a one-year course that begins in the fall semester (1 point) and continues through the spring semester (3 points). Only students who have completed both semesters will receive the full 4 points of credit.",Alison Vacca,12:10pm,2:00pm,10140,,W3960-20253-001,HONORS THESIS SEMINAR PAR,"Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies",MDES,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MDES/W3960-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,1,,R,20253MDES3960W001,SEMINAR

MECE E4461,Materials Selection for Mechanical Desig,"Understanding the properties and behavior of materials is critical to the mechanical design and subsequent function of any product or part – including wide-ranging applications from aircraft fuselage to robotic manipulators to flexures to telescope mirrors to flywheels to sports equipment to thermal insulators. This course provides a fundamental understanding of the microstructure of a range of materials (metals, polymers, ceramics, composites, hybrid) and the connection to design-determining or limiting properties including stiffness, expansion, thermal expansion, strength, energy storage and dissipation, toughness, and fatigue. Objective functions which are used to determine a “material index” for the selection of the best materials for use in a particular mechanical design are developed, underscoring the combined role of material properties and loading conditions in optimizing for materials selection. For example, take the case of determining a material index for selecting a best set of materials for a lightweight, stiff beam – how do the material density and elastic modulus together with the beam geometry and loading conditions factor in to determining the material index for materials selection? Note that the resulting material index for selecting best materials for a lightweight stiff beam (bending) is different than that for a lightweight stiff rod (tension). The material indices provide the framework for construction and use of materials selection charts to rapidly compare the effectiveness of wide-ranging materials for different applications.",Mary Boyce,11:40am,12:55pm,13521,,E4461-20253-001,Materials for Mechanical,Mechanical Engineering,MECE,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MECE/E4461-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253MECE4461E001,LECTURE

MTFC M9751,Matriculation And Facilities HNUT,"Continuous registration
 is required of MS students until all requirements (including the Thesis) have been completed. Continuous registration means the student must be registered each and every semester or, he or she must be on an official leave of absence. If continuous registration is not maintained, the student must apply for readmission to the Graduate School. ‘Continuous Registration’ includes summer sessions.
  
Students can satisfy the continuous registration requirement and maintain their current status by registering for Matriculation and Facilities (MTCF9751), allowing them access to all University facilities.  It is important for students to request leaves of absence in writing for any term in which they will be away from the University. This may be for reasons of ill health, maternity or paternity leave, military service, or other reasons deemed to be acceptable for leave by the University. If a student does not officially request a leave of absence and does not register for a semester, the student MUST apply for readmission to the University before registration is allowed.  Prior to submitting the leave of absence form, students must meet with their advisor to discuss academic progress, plans, and leave. Students should understand that taking a leave during the period in which the Department has offered support may result in a loss of funding. To request a leave of absence, submit the completed Leave of Absence form, available online at

By exploring a range of recording and editing techniques to craft new musical works beyond the limitations of live performance, this class encourages a seamless blend of composition and music production. Various genres, artists, and techniques that push the boundaries of music recording will be studied, such as Jamaican dub, musique concrète, hyper-pop, jazz fusion, and more. Students will gain hands-on experience with DAWs, exploring tools like effects processing, layering, and spatial placement. They will learn to listen closely to pieces exemplifying these techniques, building a shared analytic vocabulary to describe them. Students will also create original pieces, applying and building on the techniques studied in class, while engaging in constructive feedback with peers.",Anna Meadors,1:10pm,4:00pm,10794,,W4208-20253-001,Music Production & Studio,Music,MUSI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MUSI/W4208-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,M,20253MUSI4208W001,STUDIO

MUSI GU4630,RECORDED SOUND,"Prerequisites: The instructors permission. As music moves into the 21st century, we find ourselves surrounded by an ever-evolving landscape of technological capability. The world of music, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that change comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility. What does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer? With big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer artists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and distribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and production work on their own. But where does one go to learn how to do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production, but the historical underpinnings and the development of the music production industry as well? How does one develop a comprehensive framework within which they can place their own artistic efforts? How does one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like and develop their own style? This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be the answer. It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music from across history and genres in order to identify the production techniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern technology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical works.",David Adamcyk,1:10pm,4:00pm,11024,,W4630-20253-001,,Music,MUSI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MUSI/W4630-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253MUSI4630W001,STUDIO

MUSI GU4810,Sound Foundations,"This foundational course in sounding media will begin by exploring how listening happens as well the tools necessary to capture and present that listening. Through hands-on experimentation and demonstration, this seminar will examine both the technical and semiotic use of sound as a material within creative practice.  Fundamental acoustic and electronic principles, studio techniques, and the building blocks of analog and digital processes for the creation of sound will be explored creatively and critically. Through hands-on projects that implement these ideas we will examine critical terms through praxis.  We will study theories of sound and listening that determine or are determined by technology, from the physical and social dimensions of the sounds we use to create, language (sound as a symbol or object), acoustics (sound in space), acousmatics (sound without a visual reference), and psycho-acoustics (sound as cognitive process). This class assumes no prior knowledge or technical skill.

MUSI UN2030,JEWISH MUSIC IN NEW YORK,"Prerequisites: Music Humanities (Columbia University) or An Introduction to Music (Barnard). With the arrival of the first Jewish immigrants in New York in the mid-1600s until today, Jewish music in the City has oscillated between preserving traditions and introducing innovative ideas. This course explores the variety of ways people have used music to describe, inscribe, symbolize, and editorialize their Jewish experience. Along these lines, it draws upon genres of art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as practices that synthesize various styles and genres, from hazzanut to hiphop. Diverse musical experiences will serve as a window to address wider questions of identity, memory, and dislocation. We will also experience the Jewish soundscape of New York’s dynamic and eclectic music culture by visiting various venues and meeting key players in today’s music scene, and thus engage in the ongoing dialogues that define Jewishness in New York. A basic familiarity with Judaism and Jewish culture is helpful for this course, but it is by no means required. You do not need to know Jewish history to take this class, nor do you need to be able to read music. Translations from Hebrew and Yiddish will be provided, and musical analysis will be well explained.",Tina Fruehauf,11:40am,12:55pm,10772,,V2030-20253-001,,Music,MUSI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/MUSI/V2030-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253MUSI2030V001,LECTURE

NECR PS5107,Organizational Conflict and Mediation,"This required NECR course will introduce the concepts and skills of mediation, a type of third-party conflict intervention. This course will provide students with theory, research, and practice to effectively use mediation skills in a wide variety of contexts. Mediation practices are frequently applied to a variety of conflicts and are employed in conflict resolution strategies. Thus it is imperative for a conflict resolution practitioner to develop knowledge and skills of this practice. In this course students will be introduced to mediation philosophies, approaches, applications, and skills through readings, scholarly reflections, role-plays, a collaborative group project, and a term paper. This course will provide a deeper understanding of problem-solving and relational styles of mediation and the goals aligned with each. Students will learn to identify when mediation is appropriate, prepare for a mediation, employ communication skills, deal with negative emotions, address ethical dilemmas, and consider the cultural influences surrounding the parties and conflict.

NECR PS5150,FAMILY BUSINESS AND CONFLICT,"Conflicts that arise in family businesses are informed by long family histories and patterns of behavior, multiple identities, and are often characterized by communication breakdowns and emotional upheaval.  Conflicts in these contexts are costly emotionally, financially and relationally to family members and also to non-family employees and ultimately to the longevity of the business organization itself.  When conflict arises within these contexts it can be difficult to separate the personal relationships from the business relationships.  Because these types of business disputes can be especially emotional, how can we most effectively engage with this type of conflict?  
  
This course builds theoretical knowledge by introducing some context specific theories, models, and frameworks. We will build on existing NECR coursework introducing the Three Circle Model of Family Business (Tagiuri and Davis); Founders’s Value Categories Framework (Liebowitz);  Dynamical Systems Theory (Coleman, et.al.) as it applies to a family businesses; Family Systems Theory (Bowen; Minuchin) and family dynamics as a subsystem; Sustaining Cycles of Trust Model (Sundaramurthy)  and communications in family businesses (Astrachan and McMillan); discuss EQi-2.0 360 version (MHS) and its usefulness in the family business workplace; introduce and administer the Neethling Brain Instrument (Dr. Kobus Neethling & Paul Torrance) (NBI) as a tool for understanding more about individual thinking styles and how this knowledge informs group dynamics.  
  
Case studies will be a primary focus throughout the course, providing examples that address a spectrum of classic family business conflicts. We will use tools to analyze and develop intervention strategies in small and large group activities. This elective course is designed for NECR degree candidates, or any SPS graduate student with an interest in the topic, space permitting.  If you are a student outside the NECR program, please contact instructors for additional readings to inform course materials.  NECR students will be required to have taken Introduction to Mediation NECR PS5107, Understanding Conflict and Cooperation NECR PS5101, Skills Practicum: Self as Instrument NECR PS5880, Intrapersonal Dynamics NECR PS5124.",,9:00am,5:00pm,12471,,K5150-20253-001,FAMILY BUSINESS AND CONFL,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5150-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

NECR PS5180,RESOLVING URBAN CONFLICT,"This course explores and applies insights from a variety of academic disciplines to social conflict in urban areas. In addition, in this course we will treat the urban experience as the stage where social conflicts (family, corporate, political, etc.) are experienced and transformed collectively. 
  
Analyzing and Resolving Urban Conflict explores the contribution that the fields of conflict resolution, human geography, urban studies, and peace and conflict studies can offer to support efforts in lowering violence. This course also seeks to identify and resolve the underlying issues and patterns causing the outbreak and proliferation of violence in cities.
  
Specifically, the entire world is facing dramatic demographic changes due to the massive movement of people within and across national territories. According to the United Nations, by 2050, two out of every three people are likely to be living in cities or other urban centers. Domestically and internationally, cities are already becoming settings of new social and violent conflicts. We are already witnessing less rural insurgency and more urban insurgency, fewer guerrillas and more gangs and urban militias. In fact, urban areas are becoming the hubs of the transnational flow of commodities and people, of both licit and illicit markets. Cities around the world are increasingly stages where social problems, such as income inequality, racism, and gender-based violence are manifesting and being politically addressed via social movements.   
  
The course will have an interdisciplinary approach and will draw especially from the fields of anthropology, human geography, and peace and conflict studies. Throughout the course, these disciplines will be in dialogue with systems thinking approaches to analyze and transform social conflicts. In particular, students will also have an opportunity to apply the concepts learned by mapping and analyzing a case study of urban conflict.
  
Furthermore, the instructor will provide insights, principles and notions he has gained over the years while working as both a practitioner and a scholar in challenging urban environments such as Medellin and Bogotá, Colombia.",Joan Lopez,2:00pm,3:30pm,12472,,K5180-20253-D01,,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5180-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,"Architecture

NECR PS5212,"CONFLICT, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND COMMUNICAT","Conflict and communications technologies are inextricably connected  and this relationship  is increasingly mediated by social networks. Individuals and organizations face many challenges in using online technology for collaboration and conflict mediation purposes. Recent software innovations can facilitate knowledge acquisition, network building, and the analysis and presentation of conflict-related data. For professionals working in the field of conflict resolution, it is imperative to understand the role developments in communications technologies has  played in exacerbating and/or resolving conflicts.
  
This course will analyze the relationship between conflict and communications technologies. It will explore the challenges that individuals and networks face in using online technology for collaboration and conflict mediation purposes. It will demonstrate how recent software and social media innovations can facilitate knowledge acquisition, network building, and the analysis and presentation of conflict-related data. Finally, it will analyze contemporary cases where developments in communications technologies have played a critical role in exacerbating and/or resolving conflicts.
  
The course focuses on international peacebuilding and business and human rights cases. The former cases include Israel-Palestine, refugees, African peacebuilding, genocide prevention, and election violence monitoring. The latter cases include online harassment, cross-national email conflicts, sex trafficking, new business models such as Uber and AirBnB, and extractive resource conflicts.
  
The course will also instruct students in the use of social software (such as blogs, social media curation, and networking/visual mapping) and improve their “digital literacy” on a range of technologies. The course will provide practical (and often provocative) examples and challenge students to reflect on how these experiences and tools will be useful in their professional development and work environments.",Ted Perlmutter,,,12473,,K5212-20253-D01,CONFL SOCIAL NETWKS/COMM,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5212-20253-D01/,,On-Line Only,"Architecture

While AI technologies offer the potential to improve our institutions, lives, and decision-making, they also have myriad negative effects, including perpetuating biases, reinforcing discrimination, and creating new challenges for conflict resolution. This course explores the ways in which AI interacts with ethics, including human rights frameworks and social justice. Students will analyze how AI systems impact communities, shape policymaking, and influence the distribution of power and resources.
  
This intensive weekend course is designed to provide a deep dive into the ethical implications of AI in our complex world. Students will engage in reflections and simulations to assess real-world dilemmas at the intersection of AI and societal issues. Through interactive discussions, theoretical explorations, and strategic exercises, students will critically examine issues such as bias in AI decision-making, algorithmic accountability, and the role of AI in peacebuilding efforts.",,9:00am,5:00pm,14237,,K5305-20253-001,Ethical AI Conflict Resol,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5305-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

NECR PS5310,Special Topics: Conflict Analysis at Int,"Understanding the root causes and drivers of conflict and peace are essential when designing international development interventions of any kind and at all levels. In international development organizations that operate in the fragile and conflict-affected areas of the world, the objective of conflict analysis is a dual one: 1) to improve the effectiveness of international development policy and programming in their contribution to conflict prevention, mitigation, and/or peacebuilding; and 2) to ensure principles of conflict sensitivity and “do no harm” are applied in order to prevent inadvertently worsening existing conflicts or creating new tensions. However, each organization has their own way of undertaking such analysis, which may include an initial literature and desk review, consultations in the field with relevant stakeholders, discussion with the relevant target audience including the Country Director/Resident Coordinator, and final preparation and integration into country strategies and programming. This course will introduce students to the different frameworks and approaches for conflict analysis used within various international development organizations, most significantly within multilaterals like the World Bank (WB) and the United Nations (UN) and its various agencies and entities; as well as government departments and bilateral organizations including the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) and the United States Department of State; and finally international non-governmental organizations like Collaborative Learning Projects (CDA). Students will learn how to conduct a conflict analysis (also sometimes called a conflict assessment) at an international organization and will get a chance to work through the issues faced by policymakers in a country-level scenario simulation where they will put the theory and methodologies they have learned to the test. The course will include assigned readings and assignments due before class begins; group and individual assignments for each of the days; and assignments after the active class session ends. During the second day, there will be a discussion with a panel of experts who have conducted conflict assessments at these institutions. Students will leave the course with practical knowledge that will lend itself to conducting conflict assessments at international development organizations and beyond.",,9:00am,5:00pm,13722,,K5310-20253-001,Confl Analysis Intl Dev O,Negotiation & Conflict Resolution,NECR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NECR/K5310-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

NECR PS6050,CAPSTONE: Conflict Analysis Models,"Conflict analysis is central to understanding the context and content of any conflict. It is also critical for the person doing the conflict analysis to have a good understanding of who they are as a conflict resolution practitioner, including the frames with which they view the conflict analysis. Our worldviews, assumptions, values, and beliefs shape how we frame and create meaning from conflicts that we choose to examine, and how we understand the dynamics of those conflicts. Therefore, to conduct an impartial analysis of any conflict, and add value for the stakeholders involved, self-awareness is crucial.
  
This course is the foundation for developing the necessary mindset for conflict analysis. We want you to be able to enter any situation and ask the question, “What is really going on here?” and to use that inquiry to uncover underlying needs, issues, and assumptions. In this course, in addition to increasing your self-awareness as a conflict resolution practitioner, you will explore and become familiar with diverse conflict analysis approaches and tools, beginning with creating a conflict map to identify the actors, dynamics, and structures that are creating, escalating, and perpetuating the conflict. You will work with a variety of conflict analysis tools to examine the stakeholder perspectives and will be asked to identify issues that surfaced as a result of this analysis. You will define goals for your inquiry that correspond to the conflict issues you have identified and coalesce thematically around a specific purpose of appropriate scope for your capstone study. You will utilize the Coordinated Management of Meaning and Case Study frameworks to engage in desk-based qualitative inquiry using secondary sources. You will put theory into practice by interpreting the secondary data through the lens of applicable theory. The data will be further analyzed using CMM models and conflict analysis tools as a means of surfacing several needs to be addressed in your intervention design (in the next capstone course).
  
This course is the first of three (3) required courses of the capstone sequence.
 In 6050, students will complete conflict analysis for their capstone case study.
 In 6250, students will design an intervention that addresses the needs identified in their earlier analysis.

NMED PS5240,NARRATIVE THERAPY,"Whether alone with ourselves, or in close relationships with important people in our lives, dominant narratives shape our encounters by bringing certain aspects of our experience to the fore and marginalizing others. Narrative Therapy is a school of thought developed by Michael White, the Australian psychotherapist and social activist. Influenced by Social Constructionism and the writings of Michel Foucault (among others), White sought to understand the ways in which systems of power and control on the societal level shape our most intimate experiences. There is a price we pay for the hegemony of dominant narratives (as Foucault would say) as other aspects of our experience become marginalized and pushed out of awareness in this process. But by analyzing the dynamics by which certain narratives come to hold sway over us, and by considering what goes missing from our experience, Narrative Therapy seeks to undo this price by re-evaluating the stories we live by so that they can be more expansive and less limiting.
  
In this course we will look at the basic concepts and theoretical underpinnings of Narrative Therapy, and then begin to understand the essential techniques and areas of application of this important therapeutic school. This course does not train students to practice therapy. Our emphasis instead will be on developing ideas for ways in which the concepts and techniques introduced by Narrative Therapy can inform the practice of Narrative Medicine.
  
Questions we will address include:
 ● What can we learn from Narrative Therapy about the ways people structure stories about themselves, and how does this affect their relationship with their bodies, with illness and their conceptions of healing?
 ● What are the mechanisms by which dominant narratives from the social sphere are integrated into an individual’s self concept, and how does this then influence power relations in the clinical encounter?
 ● Theorists within Narrative Therapy strive to foster a non-hierarchical, non-expert stance in the clinical encounter. What are the possibilities and the challenges inherent in maintaining this?",Michael E Davidovits,12:10pm,2:00pm,11703,,K5240-20253-001,,Narrative Medicine,NMED,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NMED/K5240-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,M,20253NMED5240K001,SEMINAR

NMED PS5375,Disability and Illness Narratives (CERT),"This course examines questions such as: What does the telling and reading of narratives do for the ill or disabled individual? How can clinicians effectively elicit, interpret, and act upon such narratives? Who owns a story, and what is the role of co-authorship, power and witnessing in story-telling and story-listening? Whose voice do we hear? What are the roles of power and hierarchy in story-telling and listening? What is the impact of familial, cultural, social, institutional, political contexts on the individual story? And finally, how can personal stories be translated to political advocacy and action? Texts assigned weekly will be broadly interdisciplinary – drawing from memoir, poetry, essays, fiction, feature and documentary films, narrative theory, and disability studies, exploring the relationship between disability/illness experience and narrative. This elective course is open to all students in the Narrative Medicine CPA program. Students should be prepared to engage with each other and with the instructor and to offer their questions, comments, insights, and analysis.
  
This is an essential, practically applied element of narrative medicine study and it is exemplary as a way to illustrate the impact of narrative study in shaping experience, opening awareness, and highlighting the need for change and new stories. A narrative medicine course focused on disability and illness narratives is an important aspect of narrative medicine study. Exploring narratives presented in a variety of formats by using narrative medicine methods can encourage deeper perspective-taking and promote activism for underrepresented voices.

The programmatic objective of this course is to build a shared set of competencies and understandings around the power, practices, ethical applications, and desired outcomes of nonprofit marketing and communications.
  
Dramatic changes across civil society in recent years, including the evolving role of nonprofits in democratic discourse and the rise of new forms of communications technologies, means that nonprofit leaders today must have a fundamental understanding of the principles of marketing and communications in order to ensure organizational success both internally and externally. While outreach technologies and trends change rapidly in our era, true excellence in the field is based upon a core group of basic skills that are hardly novel: strong writing and analysis, strategic planning, and the ability to connect disparate individuals across a wide range of disciplines and diverse backgrounds to build an inclusive community around shared goals.
  
This course is designed to help students gain these skills through engaging with the strategic frameworks and tactical applications needed to create and leverage a range of communications and marketing activities. The course will introduce students to multiple communications and marketing practices designed to engage key stakeholders, including donors, the media, volunteers and advocates, and additional internal and external influencers and sector leaders. Throughout the semester, the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all forms of outreach (written and oral; digital and print) will be foregrounded.

NOPM PS5315,"Foundations and Social Change: Theories,","This course explores the evolving field of philanthropy by examining its historical foundations and the rationale for the continued existence of philanthropic organizations, like foundations, today. From the industrial-era legacies of figures like Rockefeller and Ford to the modern innovations driven by today's billionaires, students will analyze how generational and societal shifts have shaped the strategies and impact of philanthropy over time.
  
A key focus of the course is on how philanthropic organizations respond to complex societal issues such as racial justice, climate change, healthcare, and human rights. Through centering diverse perspectives and critical engagement with power structures, this course equips students with the tools to navigate, critique, and influence the philanthropic sector in impactful ways. Students will appraise both the catalytic role philanthropy can play in driving social change and instances where such efforts have backfired and reinforced systematic inequities. The course will further explore how foundations’ missions, values, and goals shape their decisions on funding, project duration, grantee expectations, and impact evaluation methods.
  
The course will examine different approaches to grantmaking, including social entrepreneurship, effective altruism, social justice grantmaking, and strategic philanthropy. Students will learn the differences across these conceptual frameworks and understand how they influence the ways in which foundations operate. By exploring both the conceptual and pragmatic dimensions of across these frameworks, students will understand the tensions and debates within the philanthropic sector and be well prepared to identify those foundations most likely to support their work. 
  
Students will also analyze the role of foundation program officers as change agents who navigate power, influence, and institutional constraints to drive change. Through case studies, guest speaker sessions, and real-world examples, participants will learn how these professionals influence funding priorities and partnerships in response to societal needs.
  
Students will develop and pitch a concept for a new funding initiative to a mock foundation board. This exercise will require them to demonstrate an understanding of the foundation’s mission and approach while proposing improvements to its strategic direction.

NOPM PS5350,Leading with Purpose: Advocacy and Strat,"In an era defined by unprecedented global challenges and opportunities, nonprofit advocacy serves as a powerful force for systemic reform and public innovation. This course immerses students in the intersection of theory and practice through an 
advocacy practicum
 approach—designed to equip future nonprofit leaders with the skills to influence policy, mobilize communities, and drive systemic change.
  
In the context of the ever evolving policy landscape of New York City and providing a global lens, this course offers an in-depth exploration of advocacy fundamentals within the nonprofit sector. Through real-world case studies, hands-on projects, and interactive fieldwork, students have the opportunity to examine how advocacy efforts in New York City—a hub of civic engagement—can expand broader policy frameworks and cross into international contexts.
  
Over the term, students will explore the theoretical foundations of advocacy, including social movement theory, policy influence, and public opinion formation. They will engage in stakeholder analysis, coalition-building, and the creation of advocacy strategies tailored to shifting political, economic, and social dynamics. Central to this course will be discussions on how traditional advocacy approaches are being redefined in response to growing inequalities and systemic challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptable, intersectional strategies to confront global disparities.
  
The framework emphasizes practical application: students will have the opportunity to develop and implement real advocacy plans, leveraging digital tools, media, and virtual organizing strategies to enhance their impact. Fieldwork, simulations, and collaborative projects will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to tangible issues, empowering them to lead efforts that address pressing social challenges, whether locally in New York City or globally in areas such as international development and human rights.
  
Key topics include:
  
  
Crafting advocacy strategies that influence public policy in divided political environments;
  
Building and managing coalitions across stakeholders;
  
Engaging marginalized communities to ensure inclusive and equitable advocacy efforts;
  
Navigating the digital advocacy landscape to design impactful campaigns.

In this seminar we will challenge this assumption by taking into consideration states of altered perception, wherein the brain creates perceptual experiences that do not correspond to sensory input. Specifically, we will review a number of experiments showing changes in brain activity accompanying illusions, hallucinations, and dreaming across sensory modalities (i.e., vision, hearing, touch), and in both clinical and non-clinical populations. We will examine the similarities and differences between these states of altered perception both at the level of phenomenology and underlying biological mechanisms, specifically focusing on neural oscillations.

NSBV BC3591,NEUROSCIENCE GUIDED RESEARCH,"This lab-based course introduces students to advanced methods in cognitive neuroscience, focusing on the application of electroencephalography (EEG) for real-time recording of brain activity. Unlike traditional approaches that study how the brain responds to different external stimuli or task demands, this course centers on spontaneous brain activity that occurs during rest or just before experimental events. Whether or not spontaneous brain activity is just meaningless noise remains an active area of research in cognitive neuroscience. Some researchers believe that spontaneous brain activity may be an important factor shaping our subjective experience of the world. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive in part due to the challenges in objectively defining and measuring subjective experience.
  
In this course, students will address this challenge by developing methods to study the relationship between spontaneous brain activity and subjective experience, with a particular focus on mind-wandering and the sensory phenomena elicited by Ganzflicker and Ganzfeld stimulation. The course culminates in independent research projects where students test their hypotheses by collecting and analyzing behavioral and EEG data. Key questions to address include: can spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity account for why people sometimes zone out while performing a task? Can the same fluctuations explain why people sometimes have different sensory experiences despite constant external stimuli? Do individual variations in spontaneous brain activity help explain why some people are more likely to report such experiences?
  
Note: The course involves weekly in person meetings as well as asynchronous work on data acquisition, analysis, and primary article readings for approximately 6 additional hours per week (on average).",Luca Iemi,2:00pm,4:00pm,00632,,X3591-20253-001,NEUROSCIENCE GUIDED RESEA,Neuroscience & Behavior @Barnard,NSBV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/NSBV/X3591-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,F,20253NSBV3591X001,LABORATORY

OHMA GR5025,Social Science and Other Approaches to S,"Life histories and narratives don’t speak for themselves. To disclose what these have to offer, we have to analyze them. This can be true even if the teller or author of a story is making a point with her history or narrative. That is, this teller or that author is not the only interpreter of the narrative. And this is so whether it is about herself, about other people, about organizations, about movements, about whatever; whether it’s “real” or “imaginary;” whether the medium is words, images, sound, or whatever senses a “text” engages. Life histories and narratives—usually told as sequences of events, sometimes temporally sequential, maybe connected in the telling but maybe not—have to be analyzed to be understood. Put another way: How are you going to make sense of your interviews? We need to think about analytic methods to do so. This course focuses on what it means to deploy some such methods, the utility of doing so, and the importance of doing so self-consciously. Because we employ methods for substantive purposes, the course focuses on using methods for thinking about the relationship between individual lives and the social structures within which those lives are lived. That is, we learn how to develop and deploy C. Wright Mills’s “sociological imagination” through methods learned.
 
 The course tries to achieve these ends by considering ways in which scholars and writers analyze life history and narrative information. It focuses on the utility and importance ofdifferent approaches to analyzing such information, and exposes students to the mechanics of analytic tools for carrying out such analyses. In particular, we introduce approaches used in formal social science, historical and anthropological analyses of qualitative information analysis and in not so formal social science analyses, e.g., novels! These methods/approaches can be used to reveal underlying dynamics that generate life histories and/or narratives and so deepen our understanding of specific people and their relationship to larger social and historical elements.",William McAllister,1:10pm,3:00pm,11482,,G5025-20253-001,Soc Sci & Other Apps,Oral History,OHMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/OHMA/G5025-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253OHMA5025G001,SEMINAR

PHIL GR9180,TOPICS IN MORAL PHILOSOPHY,"Prerequisites: the instructor's permission. At least one foundational course in moral philosophy is recommended as background for this course. In this seminar we will take up several questions about moral understanding and insight. Questions we will consider include: Can trusting moral testimony ever be rational or right? Are the reasons to be cautions about relying on moral testimony moral reasons or epistemic reasons (or both)? What assumptions about moral knowledge do critics and defenders of moral testimony make? How does moral knowledge differ, if it does, from moral understanding? Is there such a thing as moral expertise? Is there any reason to think that moral expertise is more problematic than other kinds of expertise? Can emotions inform us about value? Under what conditions, if any, can emotions contribute to our understanding of value? Under what conditions are emotions impediments to moral knowledge or understanding? Can fictions help us gain moral insight? Can pictures ever be legitimate tools of moral persuasion?",Axel Honneth,4:10pm,6:00pm,12123,,G9180-20253-001,TOPICS IN MORAL PHILOSOPH,Philosophy,PHIL,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Honneth,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHIL/G9180-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,3,,W,20253PHIL9180G001,SEMINAR

We will analyze arguments defending some of the central commitments of these traditions together with challenges mounted by competing schools of thought. This will offer a sense of the dynamic, dialectical, and dialogical nature of the intellectual landscape of Classical Sanskrit Philosophy and provide an introduction to some of the issues that mattered most to these philosophers. Topics will include the existence and nature of the self, the relation between consciousness and matter, fundamental ontology, external world realism vs. idealism, and the existence of a creator God. We will also inquire into the basic dichotomy of identity and difference, which in turn drives debates between monistic and pluralistic worldviews.

PHYS GU4024,APPLIED QUANTUM MECHANICS,"Prerequisites: (PHYS GU4021 and PHYS GU4022) In this course, we will learn how the concepts of quantum mechanics are applied to real physical systems, and how they enable novel applications in quantum optics and quantum information. We will start with microscopic, elementary quantum systems – electrons, atoms, and ions - and understand how light interacts with atoms. Equipped with these foundations, we will discuss fundamental quantum applications, such as atomic clocks, laser cooling and ultracold quantum gases - a synthetic form of matter, cooled down to just a sliver above absolute zero temperature. This leads us to manybody quantum systems. We will introduce the quantum physics of insulating and metallic behavior, superfluidity and quantum magnetism – and demonstrate how the corresponding concepts apply both to real condensed matter systems and ultracold quantum gases. The course will conclude with a discussion of the basics of quantum information science - bringing us to the forefront of today’s quantum applications.",Sebastian Will,2:40pm,3:55pm,13058,,W4024-20253-001,,Physics,PHYS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHYS/W4024-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,"PHYS GU4021

PHYS UN1111,ORIGINS AND MEANING,"This course is a one-semester journey across cosmological history, from the beginning of time to something akin to its end. We will explore the origin of inanimate physical structures (the cosmos as a whole, as well as that of galaxies, stars, planets, particles, atoms and complex molecules), the origin of life (replicating molecules, the first cells, as well as more complex life forms), the origin of mind (self-reflective conscious awareness) and the origin of culture (language, myth, religion, art, and science). We will then consider what science in particular tells us about the very far future, where we will encounter the likely demise of all complex matter, all life and all consciousness. In the face of such disintegration we will examine the nature of value and purpose. We will recognize that the deepest understanding of reality emerges from blending all of the accounts we discuss—from the reductionist to the humanist to the cosmological—and only through such amalgamation can we fully grasp the long-standing human search for meaning.",Brian Greene,2:10pm,5:00pm,13025,,W1111-20253-001,,Physics,PHYS,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PHYS/W1111-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

POAN PS5010,Introduction to Political Analytics,"Analytics and data-driven decision-making is playing an ever-larger role in modern political campaigns, think tanks, and media discussions of politics. In this foundations course, students learn about the history and evolution of data science in politics in the US and abroad, with a review of recent developments and trends as well as issues related to data governance, data privacy, and data ethics. Students are introduced to the scope of analytic methods employed across a range of relevant areas including campaigns, government, policy-making, and journalism. The course familiarizes students with a range of available tools and the ways in which they can be practically applied to politics and related fields. The course lays the groundwork for the specialized courses which will follow and helps students consider paths they may want to pursue to acquire specific knowledge and skills as they progress through the degree program.",Michael Schwam-Baird,6:10pm,8:00pm,12955,,K5010-20253-D01,Intro to Political Analyt,Political Analytics,POAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5010-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,2,,R,20253POAN5010KD01,LECTURE

We will discuss a wide array of applications.  Students will learn how to interpret and design experiments. In order to better understand the nuances of experimental design and analysis, we will roll up our sleeves and reanalyze some of the data from the weekly readings.",Donald P Green,6:10pm,8:00pm,12956,,K5030-20253-D01,,Political Analytics,POAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5030-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,2,,M,20253POAN5030KD01,LECTURE

Electoral campaigns, policy-making initiatives, advocacy efforts, lobbying operations, social movement activities, and media investigations can all be assessed through a program evaluation lens, enabling improved data-based decision-making regarding whether an existing program should be continued, expanded, enhanced, or discontinued. Program evaluation techniques can also be used to assess the potential impact of new programs and to improve the effectiveness of program administration. This course focuses on methods for evaluating program designs, evidence collection, analysis, and interpretation, frameworks for decision-making, and reporting and communicating findings. Students will build upon the foundational knowledge that was established during the Strategic Thinking course and develop practical skills related to various types of program evaluation.",Michael Schwam-Baird,6:10pm,8:00pm,12957,,K5050-20253-D01,,Political Analytics,POAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5050-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,2,,R,20253POAN5050KD01,LECTURE
POAN PS5110,Campaign Finance & Fundraising Analytics,"Billions of dollars are raised and spent during U.S. presidential and congressional races each election cycle. Campaign expenditures play a critical role in election outcomes and political donations are used by corporations, unions, advocacy groups, and individuals to influence elected officials and public policy. Whether they are working for campaigns, advocacy groups, or consultants, political analysts need to have a sound understanding of campaign finance law and regulations, the chief strategies that contributors and recipients use to pursue their interests, and the incredibly rich data that is available to analyze and study campaign giving in the United States.
  
In this course, students will learn about the history and current state of campaign finance regulation, what motivates donors to give and what they may (or may not) receive in return, and how campaigns themselves fundraise and spend their billions. Students will become familiar with the ways data analytics have influenced how modern campaigns approach fundraising and the strategies used by candidates to finance a run for office. Finally, students will engage with the potential benefits and pitfalls of campaign finance reforms which, along with technological change, promise to keep political fundraising in a state of flux.",Sara Yeganeh,4:10pm,6:00pm,12958,,K5110-20253-D01,Campaign Fin & Fund Analy,Political Analytics,POAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5110-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,,3,,M,20253POAN5110KD01,LECTURE

The capstone provides students with analytics experience in a “live” setting and is intended to expose students to the problems, timelines, and communications needs of actual political decision-makers. Working in small teams while being mentored by a program faculty member, students will apply core knowledge, concepts, and frameworks acquired during the program and practice the hands-on skills they have developed in their classes. Throughout the semester, student project teams will interact with the sponsoring organizations as virtual consultants, scoping the problem, acquiring the data, conducting analyses, and ultimately presenting their findings and recommendations to the project sponsor.",,4:10pm,6:00pm,12959,,K5900-20253-001,Capstone in Political Ana,Political Analytics,POAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POAN/K5900-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253POAN5900K001,LECTURE

especially domination on the basis of race. Consequently, we will devote time to both classic readings in
  
APT (the Founders, Tocqueville, Lincoln, etc.) and to multiple strands of US political thinking that

POLS BC3025,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES,"Political parties have evoked widespread scorn in the U.S. since the founding era; and yet, they arose almost immediately and have endured for over two centuries. In this course, we will examine why parties formed despite the Founders’ disdain for them. (In 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go at all.” In 1800, he won the presidency as a candidate of a major party.) We will dig into scholarly debates about what exactly parties are, what purpose they serve, and how and why they have changed over time as organizations, in the electorate, and in government. Topics will include the presidential nomination process from the founding through the much-discussed 2016 primary election season, the life cycle of third parties, and the relationship between political parties and interest groups. Students will learn what is and is not unique about the current historical moment, and how history might shape our expectations of parties moving forward. Throughout the course, we will pay particularly close attention to the roots of contemporary party polarization, and the implications of this phenomenon for representation and governance. In 1950, the American Political Science Association released a report criticizing the two major parties for excessive similarity; today, party polarization evokes widespread concern. Is there an ideal level of party difference? How much is too much? We will address these difficult questions, among others, in this broad survey of American political parties.",Katherine L Krimmel,10:10am,11:25am,00647,,X3025-20253-001,AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIE,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3025-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253POLS3025X001,LECTURE

 importance of the presidency in the American Political System. Studies examining the selection process
 and the relationship between presidents and other decision- making actors, such as the Congress,
 interest groups, the courts and the bureaucracy, will be used to inform the students to help critically
 analyze both continuity and changes in the influence of the office.
 This course examines the American presidency from both an academic and applied perspective. The
 executive branch of government has changed more than the others, especially over the past century.
 As America has moved from a legislative centered government to an executive centered one, it
 becomes important to understand the intricacies of presidents and of the presidency. This course
 examines the individuals who have held this office and stand as the head of state and government,
 along with the institutional structure of the executive branch that consists of departments, agencies,
 offices that employ over two million people. The course covers the complexities and struggles
 administrations have in navigating internal politics, along with public expectations and approval,
 influencing relations with Congress and the courts, and navigating global politics around security and
 economic interests.",Jonathan J Keller,4:10pm,6:00pm,00683,,X3033-20253-001,COLL: THE AMERICAN PRESID,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3033-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,R,20253POLS3033X001,COLLOQUIA

In this course, we’ll investigate the core premises, provocations, proposals, and tensions of feminism as they relate to specifically political problems, focusing particularly on feminist political thought as it developed in the twentieth century. Who is the subject of feminist politics? What is the meaning of “difference,” and how can—or should—feminists seek to organize across it? What are appropriate topics for politics, and what should remain private? Is the family a space for politics? The household? The body? How much of the personal can, and should, be made political?

What, then, does it mean to think about the politics of nature? We will begin by examining the ways that political thinkers have understood nature in general before moving into specifically ecological thought and ending with reflections on the central challenge of nature and politics today: climate change. Themes addressed include the role of science in politics, the challenges of politics on a global or planetary scale, the political and moral status of nonhuman nature, and the relationship between nature and economics.",Alyssa Battistoni,11:00am,12:50pm,00645,,X3120-20253-001,THE POLITICS OF NATURE,Political Science @Barnard,POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/X3120-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,T,20253POLS3120X001,COLLOQUIA

POLS UN2601,International Politics,"Why do countries go to war? What conditions foster international cooperation? How do alliances between countries function? How are countries affected by global trade and investment, and in turn how does the political economy of individual countries shape international conflict and cooperation? How do ideas and culture (including both positive ideas like human rights and negative ideas like racism) affect international politics? What role do individuals and groups play in shaping international politics? What explains the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic? Why isn’t there significant cooperation on climate change, and can a new global cooperation emerge? What issues have garnered international attention, and how has that shaped the countries’ cooperation? What causes terrorism? Is the proliferation of nuclear (or cyber) weapons a threat to peace, and if so, how should the world response? Does UN peacekeeping work?
  
In this course we will begin to grapple with these questions. We will use theories developed by philosophers, political scientists and policy analysts, and we will examine the historical roots of today’s problems, in order to explain and predict the patterns of international politics and the possibilities for change. Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to choose and develop their own theories to explain events.
  
Learning Objectives:
  
By the end of the semester, students will accomplish the following:
  
  
Demonstrate broad factual and causal knowledge of important current and historical issues in international relations.
  
Apply contending theories from the political science literature and the policy world to analyze, compare, and evaluate events and trends in international relations.
  
Assess the value of competing theories in explaining events.

POLS UN3112,"GANDHI, KING & POLS OF NONVIOLENCE","Since Gandhi’s experiments in mass 
satyagraha
 over a century ago, nonviolence has become a staple of protest politics across the globe.  From the Occupy movements to the Arab Spring to Movement for Black Lives, it might even be entering a new phase of revitalization.  At the same time, what exactly nonviolence is and what it can accomplish in politics is very much under debate.   This course aims to understand the politics of nonviolence by examining the political ideas and political careers of its most well-known twentieth-century advocates, M.K. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.  
  
Though still venerated as founding figures of nonviolent protest, Gandhi and King have come to be remembered in ways that can misconstrue how they understood and practiced nonviolent politics.  To many, Gandhi is a saintly idealist, who wanted to imbue politics with the spirit of 
ahimsa
, truth, and conscience.   Likewise, King is taken to be a spokesman for interracial brotherhood and Christian love.  While partly true, these images also downplay the political side of their nonviolence – the techniques of organizing and strategies of protest that made their movements successful. 
  
We will examine the evolution of Gandhi’s and King’s political thinking in relation to the movements they led – the Indian independence movement and the civil rights movement in the US.  We will consider how the theory and practice of nonviolence evolved and changed as it moved from one context to another.  We will be especially focused on understanding the dynamics of nonviolent protest.",Karuna Mantena,4:10pm,5:25pm,13983,,W3112-20253-001,"GANDHI, KING & POLS OF NO",Political Science,POLS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POLS/W3112-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,TR,20253POLS3112W001,LECTURE

POLS UN3565,DRUGS & POLITICS IN AMERICAS,"A major challenge for governments across the Western Hemisphere is the complex relationship between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods to the global arenas where governments debate and craft international drug policy. These links also reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule, race relations during and following the collapse of the institution of slavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States. Throughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues to broader theories, concepts and empirical findings in political science. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted below with the headings A – G) under three overarching themes for this semester:
  
 
  
1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: 
The first theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of illicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions we will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit?  How did domestic and global politics come together to shape the global drug regime and the “war on drugs?” What role did race and gender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs?
  
 
  
2. Illicit Drugs, Politics and Governance:
 The second theme focuses on contemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. Here we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets are either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions like: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the relationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role do illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors?  Are states and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at “war” with each other?

Today, that number is one in twenty.  Global progress is however marred by tremendous disparities, and much more progress is possible.  Students in the course will learn about the conditions that affect children in high-mortality settings; review the evidence base for major child survival interventions; and examine the practical issues related to their implementation.  Students will look at these issues from a global, national, and program perspective, ranging from the impact of global policies, to the track record of national strategies, to key program management skills they will need to be effective.  These skills include monitoring, evaluation, communication, cross-cultural understanding, leadership and human resources.

The curriculum will explore the ways in which the environmental justice movement in the US has succeeded in implementing just forms of health research, progressive environmental health policies, and protections from racial/cultural injustice, as well as obstacles, policy impediments and potential paths forward. We will examine environmental health/justice theories and perspectives in the contexts of health impacts on various populations, including American communities of color and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, indigenous peoples, women and children.  We will study climate change, natural disasters, urban pollution and segregation, extractive industries, and environmental sustainability.

Conducting evidence-based public health that reflects the mission and values of the Department of Population & Family Health (PopFam) requires skills to: clarify gaps in knowledge and evidence to explicate how such gaps can be filled; solicit funding and community support for research projects that can inform public health practice; ensure applied public health research is feasible, and carried out efficiently and according to plan; and that the results and “lessons learned” are disseminated to guide next action steps.  This course will provide students with skills to engage in culturally competent public health work from the get-go – recognizing how to be attentive to inclusion and equity in generating research and evaluation questions, project management, and communication and dissemination. This course is designed as a complement to students’ experiences with research or program-based practica and their subsequent capstone/integrated learning experience (ILE); therefore, priority will be given to second-year PopFam students.",,4:00pm,6:50pm,14493,,P8661-20253-001,PLN MNG & COMMS,Population and Family Health,POPF,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POPF/P8661-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

POPF P8662,Child Development & Health Programs,"Childhood and adolescence are critical windows of opportunity in human development to influence health, learning and productivity throughout life. In the earliest years of childhood, survival, growth and development are interlinked; growth affects both chances of survival and the child's development, and all three are influenced by family care practices, resources and access to services. Adolescence is the second period of rapid growth when foundational learning associates with distinct neuro-maturational changes. Contributing to increased investment in the early years and adolescence are new demands related to changing economic, social, demographic, political and educational conditions. The course will focus on populations along the lifespan, thinking through child development and why and how programs positively affected health outcomes. Students will understand the role of early child development programs (ECD) in the achievement of improved educational success and improved long-term health. The course will also explore adolescence through a developmental lens and the complex life events and social constructs that can influence adolescent behaviors. Through interactive lectures, small-group discussions and debates, and presentations by established guest speakers, students will learn to analyze programs and services, including how we can work with parents, support young children and adolescents in time of emergencies, and work within the health care system through a variety of hospital, community, school and family-based approaches to promote health and positive development.",,8:30am,11:20am,14494,,P8662-20253-001,CHILD DEVELOPMENT & HLTH,Population and Family Health,POPF,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POPF/P8662-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

In some cases, groups are denied life-sustaining services because of race, politics, or HIV status. Public health practitioners are uniquely situated and qualified to advocate for populations whose human rights and survival are threatened by the intentional actions of organized groups. This class will teach students techniques for detecting and estimating the rates of these major abuses of human rights in order to better advocate for the abused, and to permit the evaluation of programs designed to prevent such events. At the end of the course, students will be expected to be able to evaluate the sensitivity of surveillance systems, and undertake surveys, designed to measure the rates of violent deaths and rape.

POPF P8687,Public Health and Humanitarian Action,"Humanitarian action has come to occupy a central place in world politics and a theory of rights rather than charity is now driving international assistance and protection in wars and disasters. Global events over the past two decades indeed suggest that the world needs a humanitarian system capable of responding reliably, effectively and efficiently across a full range of emergencies. Whether people are suffering as a result of an earthquake in China or organized violence in Darfur, the humanitarian response system is expected to reach them in a timely and informed manner. Global wealth suggests that it can; and, global morality says that it should. Success of humanitarian action depends upon political, technical and organizational factors. The practice of public health focuses on improving the technical and organizational capacities, but this course will display that political forces are equally essential for alleviating human suffering. Deep problems of political distortion and perennial problems of agency performance and practice continue to compromise global, impartial and effective humanitarian action. This course examines efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and protection in war and disaster crises. It combines the theoretical with the possible, highlighting constraints to action from the perspective of the humanitarian agency and professional worker in the field. Key public health priorities—including the major causes of disease and death and how best to detect, prevent and treat them--are examined. Particular attention is paid to human rights and humanitarian protection, including their nature, content, and linkages with public health assistance. Students will be exposed to current trends and debates, sides will be taken and defended, and the class will be enriched by the participation, contributions and challenges of the students.",Juliana A Bol,1:00pm,3:50pm,14497,,P8687-20253-001,PUB HLTH & HUMANITARIAN A,Population and Family Health,POPF,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/POPF/P8687-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

The value of a well-researched and well-written Capstone Paper extends far beyond the MPH degree. Effective organizations depend upon staff members who can design needs assessments, programs, evaluations, and strategic plans, and document them in writing. Policy advocates seek professionals to articulate complicated public health evidence and ideas in briefs, articles, reports, and monographs. Doctoral programs look for students who can conceptualize, analyze, and communicate complex, interdependent health circumstances.

The initial sessions will be led by faculty, who model seminar leadership and participatory discussion. Subsequent sessions will be co-led by students, who will rotate in this responsibility. In advance of each session, the lead students will work with faculty to refine the suggested reading list of documents or presentations for critical analysis and reflection. All participating students will prepare annotations and commentary, which will be available to other students, and will be a foundation for discussion in each session. An overall grade for such analysis will be awarded.
Students will present a brief list of key readings for a specific topic and a two-page outline of the proposed review for discussion before session 3. Students will start leading the discussion of those topics beginning in session 4 of the class. Where possible, the student(s) leading each session will have real-world work experience in that area. Students will be graded on their specific summary outline and the leadership of their class discussion.

PSYC UN2435,Social Neuroscience,"This course will provide a broad overview of the field of social neuroscience. We will consider how social processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social phenomena and cultural experiences. Many believe that the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others—competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. What kind of “social brain” has this evolutionary past left us with? In this course, we will review core principles, theories, and methods guiding social neuroscience, as well as research examining the brain basis of processes such as theory of mind, emotion, stereotyping, social group identity, empathy, judging faces and bodies, morality, decision-making, the impact of culture and development, among others. Overall, this course will introduce students to the field of social neuroscience and its multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context.",Jon B Freeman,2:40pm,3:55pm,10389,,W2435-20253-001,,Psychology,PSYC,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Freeman_%28academic%29,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/W2435-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has shed light on the mechanisms associated with the various types of bilingualism, and has shown that using two languages affects a variety of cognitive abilities, starting in infancy and continuing until an old age. The primary findings of recent research in cognitive neuroscience are reviewed and discussed in this course. Bilingualism also has a political facet – governments decide what languages are used in public institutions and taught in schools. This course also evaluates scientific findings on bilingualism for their potential implications on informing parents, educators, and policy makers.",Michele Miozzo,4:10pm,6:00pm,11142,,W3260-20253-001,,Psychology,PSYC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/W3260-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

We will start by examining how individual differences in behavior and health are shaped by gene-environment interactions. We will complement these studies with the endophenotype approach and discuss its role in our contemporary views of complex disorders. We will then introduce behavioral epigenetics studies that are suggested to mediate the effects of gene-environment interactions at different levels of analysis. We will continue by discussing how these topics shape and are shaped by developmental programming. We will end the semester by discussing the major debates around these topics as well as their implications in real life and public policies. By covering these topics, students are expected to gain a better understanding of how our behavior is i) formed and shaped by gene-environment interactions over time, ii) influenced by the underlying physiological and epigenetic mechanisms, and iii) changed by developmental processes. With this information, the students are expected to view individual differences in behavior in a perspective that is highly interdisciplinary and dynamic.",Elif A Duman,6:10pm,8:00pm,11137,,W3495-20253-001,Gene-Env Interaction & Ep,Psychology,PSYC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PSYC/W3495-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

PUBH GU4200,"Environment, Health, and Justice: Concep","Please note: this class was designed as part of the Special Concentration in Public Health. It is open to undergraduates, as well as students in Public Health, and will be taught on the Morningside campus. This course introduces key concepts on environmental health sciences and environmental justice and their application to address environmental health disparities affecting communities in New York City, across the United States and globally. The course will present theory and methods needed to characterize, understand and intervene on environmental health problems with a focus on methods that are particularly appropriate for environmental justice research and interventions. We will describe environmental health disciplines such as exposure sciences, environmental epidemiology, environmental biosciences and toxicology, as well as methods to assess expected environmental health impacts",,10:10am,11:25am,11132,,W4200-20253-001,ENVIRONMENT HEALTH JUSTIC,Columbia College,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/W4200-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253PUBH4200W001,LECTURE
PUBH P6022,FOUNDATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH,"Public health is a science-based discipline that depends on the analysis of empirical data to guide decision making. Public health decisions also involve value judgments and questions that cannot be answered solely, or primarily, with data. The goal of the Foundations Studio is to equip students with a set of conceptual frameworks and analytic tools for making those judgments and answering those questions. Comprising concentrations on history, ethics and human rights, this studio views public health practice and policy through a wide-angle lens and encourages students to think broadly about the social, political, cultural, legal, and economic drivers of public health outcomes. The studio is designed to help students grapple with challenging issues of justice, equity, individual rights and liberties, and collective action; and to develop a critical capacity for thinking broadly and deeply about public health issues.",,5:30pm,6:30pm,14508,,P6022-20253-D01,FOUNDATIONS OF PUBLIC HEA,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6022-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Public Health,2,,W,20253PUBH6022PD01,LECTURE
PUBH P6032,RESEARCH METHODS & APPLICATIONS,"Successful public health studies, policies, and interventions rely on evidence to guide their design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Because public health is not a simple, reactive, “take the pill three times a day” solution, but a purposeful approach to preventing disease and promoting health, the tools of scientific inquiry to document, measure, evaluate, and understand all the consequences of health interventions are essential. Learning to identify, gather, and interpret evidence is therefore crucial for public health practitioners. The Research Methods & Applications studio provides an introduction to scientific inquiry and evidence and their relationships to public policy. Using an integrated approach spanning multiple disciplines, students will be provided with a basic introduction to quantitative and qualitative measurement and data collection, tenets of epidemiologic study design, statistical inference and data analysis techniques, and the tools of science. Views on the differences between scientific and other types of inquiry and knowledge, classical models of how science and evidence can inform policy and programs, and sources of tension at the science- policy interface will be explored and discussed. The methods introduced in this course will provide a toolkit with which to help measure and estimate the relationships between the smaller pieces that comprise the complex and dynamic web of systems in public health.",,5:30pm,6:30pm,14513,,P6032-20253-D01,Qualitative Foundations,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6032-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Public Health,0-4.5,,W,20253PUBH6032PD01,LECTURE
PUBH P6042,DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH,"This studio is concerned with 
etiology
, or the “cause, set of causes, or manner of causation of disease or condition”. As such, we will explore the patterning (who/what) and determinants (why) of population health. The course will focus on determinants ranging from upstream features of the social and physical environment to downstream, proximal risk factors at the level of individual biology, as well as the interactions between them. While often we think about our health as a function of behaviors we can control and genetics we can’t, the reality is much more complex, involving dynamic interplay between biology and the environment over the life course. Where we live, what we are exposed to, and the social and economic positions we occupy are major influences on our health, becoming encoded in our biology and expressed in the diseases we develop (or avoid) and, ultimately, in our longevity. Identifying these factors and understanding their health consequences is central to public health. 
  
 
  
In this studio, students become acquainted with a) the major environmental issues that we face, b) the social factors such as race/racism, socioeconomic status and gender that influence health, and c) the underlying biological basis of human disease. In addition, students will be presented with the approaches used to address the health consequences of these determinants.",,6:30pm,7:30pm,14518,,P6042-20253-D01,,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6042-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Public Health,3,,R,20253PUBH6042PD01,LECTURE
PUBH P6072,INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE & PRACTICE,"The different studios in the Mailman Core teach a set of foundational perspectives, knowledge, and skills. But the practice of public health requires applying this education in a context characterized by uncertainty, risk, competing interests, conflicting values, and systems of oppression that perpetuate racism and drive inequities across multiple dimensions of society
  
 
  
The Integration of Science and Practice (ISP) uses case studies of actual events to help students analyze the complicated nature of public health practice. The course immerses students in the complex arena of public health decision-making and debate, placing them in the role of stakeholders and policymakers who must marshal both their core knowledge and disciplinary perspectives to explore different options and create and justify interdisciplinary responses to public health challenges. The cases also provide an opportunity to identify crosscutting themes and questions (e.g. knowledge gaps; used of evidence; trade-offs in public health decision making, inequities and inequalities; discrimination; public health ethics; politics; interest group agendas; funding and available resources; organization; public perception, etc.).
  
 
  
Fundamental to all the cases, ISP provides a structured space to explore systems of oppression, our relationship to these systems, and their impact on public health.
  
 
  
In the Fall semester these cases are based upon classic public health dilemmas, and links are made to their relevance to current public health issues. The cases serve as an archive of sorts, a library of examples to draw on as points of comparison when they encounter similar problems and issues in other classes or during their careers.",Marlyn M Delva,6:40pm,8:20pm,14555,,P6072-20253-D01,INTEGR OF SCI & PRACT,Public Health,PUBH,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/PUBH/P6072-20253-D01/,To be announced,On-Line Only,Public Health,1.5,,W,20253PUBH6072PD01,LECTURE

Through a series of sessions with leading public health experts, this course views the multifaceted nature of public health through a prismic lens addressing key concepts, approaches, and issues of historical and contemporary import: What is public health and how has public health evolved over time? What are the core methods of public health? What are the approaches to understanding and addressing both infectious and chronic, non-communicable diseases? What role do micro- and macro-level determinants (i.e. biology and social context) play in public health? What are the global trends in population health? How does the individual life course bear on population health? How do systems, policy, and population health mutually shape each other? How are public health programs designed and evaluated?

RELI BC2003,Religion and Political Thought,"Are “belief” and “reason” two different things? What is the proper role of religion in modern society? How do we determine what is just and unjust in the absence of a Higher Law? Does religion continue to influence political decision-making in liberal democracies, and if so, how? These questions continue to animate debates about the relationship between religion and politics today. This class examines articulations of and responses to this question in the political thought of the Enlightenment, a period that has traditionally been described as the moment when “the West” parted ways with religion and religious belief as the foundation for its understanding of truth, justice, and social order. In this class, we will examine classic and overlooked works of Enlightenment philosophy. We will interrogate whether the Enlightenment really signaled a departure from religion. We will also examine whether the Enlightenment was the preserve — much less the invention — of white Europeans and American settlers. We will do so with an eye toward the politics of the present, examining how Enlightenment thought’s engagement with religion produced discourses of race, gender, economy, and nationhood that continue to shape the terms of political discourse today.",Timothy Vasko,2:40pm,3:55pm,00453,,X2003-20253-001,Religion and Political Th,Religion @Barnard,RELI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/X2003-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253RELI2003X001,LECTURE

How and why have modern regimes of human rights privileged some of these ideas and marginalized others? What can these complicated relationships between religion and human rights explain some of the key crises in human rights law and politics today, and what avenues can be charted for moving forward? In this class, we will attempt to answer these questions by first developing a theoretical understanding of some of the key debates about the origins, trajectories, and legacies of modern human rights’ religious entanglements. We will then move on to examine various examples of ideas about and institutions for protecting “humanity” from different regions and histories. Specifically, we will examine how different societies, organizations, and religious traditions have addressed questions of war and violence; freedom of belief and expression; gender and sexual orientation; economic inequality; ecology; and the appropriate ways to punish and remember wrongdoing.

RELI GR6101,THEORY & METHOD-STUDY OF RELIG,"“Theories and Methods” courses in any field are commonly unwieldy beasts. They cannot but be a compromise-formation between contemporary questions and texts, ideas, and definitions (alongside a whole lot of problems) that we have inherited as “canonical” in a field. In the best case, such a course is a passageway into deeper engagement with a field, its histories, its complexities, and its possibilities from which we might wrest and build viable futures. Disciplinary fields are structures where power and knowledge are produced and reproduced. The study of religion is no exception. The questions of “how is ‘religion’ constructed as a category here?” and “what work does the designation of something or someone as ‘religious’ do?” will, therefore, accompany us throughout our work over the course of this semester. We will also examine how different methodological commitments shape what objects of study and which questions come to the fore for the study of religion. This course will explore how the study of religion is not reducible to the study of traditions and communities that are readily recognized as “religious.” However, the vexed histories of the construction of “religion” as a category of knowledge production does also not negate that there are large, varied, and flourishing communities of practice beyond the university for whom whether or not “religion” exists is not at all a question. Holding these layers of complexity in play, this course seeks to introduce students exemplarily to key texts and concepts that have shaped the study of religion as we encounter it today as an academic discipline.",Dominique Townsend,2:10pm,4:00pm,10472,,G6101-20253-001,THEORY & METHOD-STUDY OF,Religion,RELI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/RELI/G6101-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253RELI6101G001,SEMINAR

RERS GR8445,LEGACIES OF EMPIRE & SOV UNION,"This intensive course offers an introduction to multiple disciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches to the major issues defining the emergence, persistence, and transformation of the countries that once comprised the Soviet bloc. The course explores the history, politics, economies, societies, and political cultures of Russia, the non-Russian republics of the former USSR, and East Central Europe, focusing on the conceptual, methodological, and theoretical developments employed by Soviet studies in North America and related disciplines. It also critically interrogates the enduring relevance and problems posed by the widespread use of the term “Soviet legacy” in reference to contemporary features and challenges faced by the region.
  
The intensive nature of this course is reflected in two ways- preparation and focus. First, the course carries a substantial reading load designed to inform and prepare students for the course sessions. These assignments will mostly be academic readings, but may also include short videos, news articles, and digital archival materials. In order to use our time together productively, the lectures and discussion will build upon, not review, the assignments for the session. Each session typically will be split into 2 segments, roughly of 55-60 minutes each. Many of these segments will be taught by guest lecturers who will give 30 mins presentations on their topic and then field questions. During our limited time for Q&A students should ask single, concise questions.",Elise Giuliano,4:10pm,6:00pm,10943,,G8445-20253-001,LEGACIES OF EMPIRE & SOV,Russian Eurasian E.

RUSS UN3230,"Tricksters in World Culture: Mockery, Su","Tricksters constitute one of the universal themes or tropes in mythology and folklore of many cultures. Through the discussions of ancient Greek, Native-American, African, Paleo-Asiatic, Scandinavian, African-American, Muslim and Jewish myths and folklore about tricksters, the course will telescope the cultural functions of the comedic transgression as a form of social critique; it will also highlight cynicism, its productive and dangerous aspects. Then we’ll introduce different historical subtypes of tricksters, such as a fool, jester, holy fool, kynik, picaro, con artist, female and queer tricksters, thus  moving through premodern and early modern periods. Each type of the trickster is illustrated by literary examples from different world cultures (European and non-European alike) as well as theoretical works of Mikhail Bakhtin, Michel Foucault, Giorgio Agamben, and Peter Sloterdijk. Finally, the role of the trickster in modernity will be discussed through the case of Soviet tricksters, who had become true superstars manifesting the resistance to repressive political ideology by the means of “cynical reason”.

Collaboration and Climate Adaptation 
brings students to the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York to learn first hand from researchers and practitioners who help supply over ten million New Yorkers with safe and abundant drinking water while also working to build social, economic and environmental capital in the towns and villages located in the watershed surrounding the city’s reservoirs – all against a backdrop of increasing climate-related disruption. 
  
The class will learn how New York City and a coalition of upstate watershed communities worked to end nearly a century of mutual resentment, displacement and extraction by entering into the 
Watershed Agreement of 1997
, which has become a widely renowned model for collaborative and equitable water resources management planning in the twenty-five years since its completion. Students will engage with several of the Watershed Agreement’s original negotiators and with the local elected officials, agency staff and non-profit leaders who implement its signature “
multi-barrier
” strategy for drinking water protection through open space preservation, support for sustainable farming practices and investments in clean water infrastructure and sustainable economic growth in watershed communities. They will also learn how increases in storm intensity and warming driven by climate change threaten to upset the delicate balance between New York City’s need for safe drinking water and the socio-economic interests of upstate watershed communities.

Themes and topics include: the relationship between science and empire, the centrality of resource control to the consolidation of political authority, the history of wilderness preservation and conservation, the environmental dimensions of the history of international development, strategies of indigenous rights movements, the emergence of market-based approaches to environmental crises, and the invention of sustainable development.

SDEV UN3310,ETHICS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVPT,"Aiming to improve human conditions within many diverse environments, sustainable development seeks to create, increase and perpetuate benefit and to cease, rectify and reverse harm. Sustainable development is consequently inextricable from the fabric of ethics, woven with determinations of benefit and harm to the existence and well-being of both humans and nonhumans. Underlying such determinations are those of self- and other-regarding motivation and behavior; and underlying these are still others, of sensitivity and rationality in decision-making, whether individual, social or public. Sustainable development is interlaced with and contingent upon all these determinations, at once prescriptive and judgmental, which can be called the ethics of sustainable development. This course is divided into four main sections, of which two are intended to show the ethical fallacies of unsustainable development, and two, the ethical pathways of sustainable development. The first section focuses upon ethically problematic basic assumptions, including human (species) hegemony, happy (hedonic) materialism, and selective (data) denial. The second focuses upon ethically problematic ensuing rationalizations, including those pertaining to damages, victims, consequences and situations of climatic, chemical, biological and ecological harm. The third section responds to these rationalizations with ethically vital considerations of earth justice, environmental justice, culturally-based ethics, and sector-based ethics (water, food, place and climate ethics). Finally, the fourth section responds to the initial, longstanding problematic assumptions with a newly emergent ethical paradigm, comprising biotic wholeness, environmental integrity and the deliberative zero-goal. Tying all sections together is the central theme: to be sustainable, development must be ethical. Reflecting the collaborative quality of the field of sustainable development, the course extends to readings whose authors have all pursued their work at intersections of science and ethics, environment and ethics, policy and ethics, business and ethics, and sustainable development and ethics.",Adela J Gondek,1:10pm,2:25pm,11089,,W3310-20253-001,ETHICS OF SUSTAINABLE DEV,Earth Institute,SDEV,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SDEV/W3310-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20253SDEV3310W001,LECTURE

SDEV UN3390,GIS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMNT,"This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive overview of theoretical concepts underlying GIS systems and to give students a strong set of practical skills to use GIS for sustainable development research. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a system of computer software, data and analysis methods used to create, store, manage, digital information that allow us to create maps and dynamic models to analyze the physical and social processes of the world. Through a mixture of lectures, readings, focused discussions, and hands-on exercises, students will acquire an understanding of the variety and structure of spatial data and databases, gain knowledge of the principles behind raster and vector based spatial analysis, and learn basic cartographic principles for producing maps that effectively communicate a message. Student will also learn to use newly emerging web based mapping tools such as Google Earth, Google Maps and similar tools to develop on-line interactive maps and graphics. The use of other geospatial technologies such as the Global Positioning System will also be explored in this class. Case studies examined in class will draw examples from a wide ranges of GIS applications developed to assist in the development, implementation and evaluation of sustainable development projects and programs. On completion of the course, students will: 1. use a variety of GIS software programs to create maps and reports; 2. develop a sound knowledge of methods to search, obtain, and evaluate a wide variety of spatial data resources; 3. develop skills needed to determine best practices for managing spatial data resources; 4. use GIS to analyze the economic, social and environmental processes underlying the concept of building a sustainable world; 5.

SOCI BC3202,Structural Determinants of Health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the “Social” Determinants of Health to the “Structural” Determinants of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes. An analysis that focuses upstream reveals that government policies and social structure are at the core of health disparities. Through the lens of New York City and its health systems, this course will cover a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in housing and homelessness, biases in medical institutions, and the unconscious bias that lead providers to have racialized perception of an individual’s pain tolerance. In addition to exposing these inequalities the course will also provide innovative solutions that seek to mitigate these barriers including: home visiting programs, medical respite programs for homeless patients and food as medicine in health care systems. Students will demonstrate their knowledge through individual writing, and class discussion. The course revolves around important readings, lectures, and podcasts that illustrates how one’s class position and the color of one’s skin can influence the access to healthcare one has as well as their experie",Maati Momplaisir,6:10pm,7:25pm,00320,,X3202-20253-001,STRUCTURAL DETERMNTS OF H,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/X3202-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253SOCI3202X001,LECTURE

While some forms of social closure, like segregation, are more well known, there are numerous mechanisms of social exclusion people and groups employ in the social world. Additionally, forms of exclusion do not always come from the top down as a form of domination, but sometimes from the bottom up, with the goal of resource redistribution. We will study these different forms of exclusion along with the theorized aims these forms of closure seek to achieve to get a more comprehensive picture of how social exclusion is used in the social world.",Dominic T Walker,11:40am,12:55pm,00692,,X3249-20253-001,SOCIAL CLOSURE AND INEQUA,Sociology @Barnard,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/X3249-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,TR,20253SOCI3249X001,LECTURE

SOCI GR6003,THE SOCIOLOGY OF SEXUALITIES,"Despite the ubiquity of sexual imagery in contemporary Western popular culture, most people regard sexuality to be an intimate topic that concerns the drives, experiences and pleasures of individuals. In this course, we will examine the social and pluralistic character of sexual desires, meanings, practices and politics. We will begin with some of conceptual foundations that ground contemporary sociological studies of sexuality. We will think together about how knowledge about the social sources of sexuality is produced and some of the methodological, epistemological and ethical quandaries faced by researchers--including the ways our own sexualities, desires, inhibitions and identities frame our work. We will then examine some of the key questions in the sociology of sexualities, including the complexity of classifying sexual identities, practices and populations, the relationship between institutional contexts and sexual behavior, and intersections with the sociology of race, gender, risk, health and regulation. In each of these discussions, students will explore the varied methodological approaches to these topics within sociology, as well as some of the disciplinary and cultural challenges to making sexuality a central object of intellectual inquiry.",Tey Meadow,10:10am,12:00pm,13147,,G6003-20253-001,THE SOCIOLOGY OF SEXUALIT,Sociology,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/G6003-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,GSAS,4,,T,20253SOCI6003G001,SEMINAR

In more recent decades, a similar movement has happened among queer and trans theorists. In this course, we will engage this work, much of which has been published in the past decade and a half. We will start with provincializing central concepts of feminist and queer theory: gender and sexuality. Taking an intersectional approach that attends to race, class, nation, and other social divisions, we will read scholars who study gender/sexuality around the world, including in Latin America, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The readings will draw our attention to the ways in which gender/sexuality are implicated in imperial and post-colonial projects as well as how gender and sexuality operate outside the West, both in practice and identity. Finally, we will consider the possibilities and limitations for studying gender/sexuality beyond our own societies. Critical approaches to gender and sexuality challenge conventional “born this way” narratives about gender and sexual identities as innate. This course will raise questions that will make us uncomfortable and, hopefully, transform our understandings of our own gendered and sexual identities and practices.",Tara Gonsalves,2:10pm,4:00pm,13297,,G6004-20253-001,Approaches Gender/Sexuali,Sociology,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/G6004-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Architecture

We first discuss Jewish immigration in the pre-state period (before 1948), Palestinian forced migration in the 1948 and 1967 wars, Jewish immigration to Israel until the 1967 war, and migration of Jews and non-Jews (including labor migrants and refugees) during the post-1967 period. In this context, we will analyze the ethnic/racial and national cleavages – between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews and between Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel –that have been developing in Israel since 1948 and before. 
  
In addition, we will discuss Israel’s ‘migration’ into the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967 and the ramifications of such population movement on the Palestinian and Israeli societies.

State support is shrinking, student debt is increasing, full-time faculty are being replaced by adjuncts, and learning outcomes are difficult to measure, at best. This class will try to makes sense of these changes. Among other questions, it will ask whether higher education is a source of social mobility or a means of class reproduction; how the college experience differs by race, class, and type of college attended; how the economics of higher education have led to more expensive college and more student loans; and how we might make college better. We will consider several different points of view on the current state of U.S. higher education: that of students who apply to and attend college, that of colleges and universities, and that of society at large.

SOCI UN3943,Life on Mars: Building a New Society in,"This course explores the interdisciplinary challenges of establishing a human society on Mars. Students explore a number of challenges that are involved in reaching the Red Planet and setting up a functional social habitat for the long term. This includes both the numerous logistical hurdles of traveling to and surviving on Mars, as well as the social, political, and ethical considerations of establishing a new society on the planet. Through analysis and discussion of scientific research, social science texts, and popular media, students will gain a deep understanding of the physiological, psychological, and strategic challenges of long-duration space travel and human habitation on another planet.
  
The course is not scientific or overly technical in nature. Instead, the perspective being adopted is that of a social scientist seeking to understand how humans can travel to another planet and live together. The first half of the course focuses on the practical, physiological, and psychological challenges of traveling to and surviving on Mars while maintaining contact withEarth. In the first part of the course, students will study the unique environmental conditions of Mars, the health risks of space travel, and how to maintain communication and connectivity with Earth despite vast distances. Students will also engage with how sustainable living on Mars—through food, energy, and resource management—could shape the future of human expansion in space.
  
The second half delves into the complexities of building social, legal, and economic systems in a new extraterrestrial society. Students will critically evaluate how to create a self-sustaining, functional civilization on Mars. Given the social science focus of the class, there will be emphasis placed on topics such as governance, establishing social contracts and property rights, and building economic systems for an entirely new world.
  
This course is meant to attract a small group of 10-15 students interested in space exploration. The small size and intensive four-hour class format is intended to foster creative problem-solving and interdisciplinary thinking (see below for discussion of non-traditional format).

Readings for the course will be from a broad range of disciplines, including sociology, criminology, law, and public policy.  Most weeks, the readings will include relevant “popular press” articles that will help situate the literature in the context of current debates. The course is organized in two parts. The first half will focus on the problems of crime and violence in urban environments. We will review classic and modern ideas and theories explaining crime and violence, and we will look at the evidence describing patterns and trends in crime in recent history. The second half of the course will focus on the approaches to confront crime and violence, with a strong emphasis on policing. We will review the literature on the relationship between crime and policing, and we will learn about the impact that policing practices have on individuals and their communities.",Gerard Torrats-Espinosa,4:10pm,6:00pm,13118,,W3983-20253-001,,Sociology,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/W3983-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253SOCI3983W001,SEMINAR
SOCI UN3986,"Race, Discrimination, and Racial Inequal","This course focuses on race, discrimination, and racial inequalities. The course will address three key questions: (1) What is race as perceived in the U.S. and Europe, and what are the sources of racial inequalities? (2) What does social science research tell us about patterns and trends of racial inequalities? (3) What policies can alleviate racial inequalities? The course will systematically adopt comparative perspectives focusing on the North American and European contexts. We will also address research on race and racial inequality within an interdisciplinary lens particularly building on sociology, economics, and social psychology.
  
This course is designed for advanced undergraduate students from Columbia University and Science Po (Paris). We aim for a class of 30 students (15 from each partner university). Class will take place once a week (for 2 hours). In addition, the Columbia TA will conduct a discussion section once a week in which Columbia and Sciences Po students will work together in small groups on class projects that will be presented over the course of the semester. The classes will be organized in a hybrid format. In each campus, the professor will teach his/her class in person and the two classes will be connected via Zoom. The Columbia and Science Po professors will thus co-teach a virtually connected class. The professors will closely coordinate and alternate in leading the lecture and discussion parts of each class.",,10:10am,12:00pm,13141,,W3986-20253-001,"Race, Dscrmttion, Rac Inq",Sociology,SOCI,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOCI/W3986-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,R,20253SOCI3986W001,SEMINAR

SOSC P6730,Vital Records and Vital Statistics: The,"Deaths due to COVID-19 have focused public awareness on death registration in a way that has not been seen since the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic. Death registration is an affirmation of the conclusion of a person’s life and offers the opportunity and obligation to enumerate each death and document the final disposition of human remains.  Though often considered “just administrative” birth registration can be seen as a public health intervention designed to protect basic human rights, connect people with upstream social determinants of health like education, housing, and income, and ensure that their existential drive to exist is acknowledged. 
Vital records are the documents that catalog birth and death experiences millions of times each year in the U.S.  Vital statistics are the subset of the information on these records that public health students and professionals appreciate in general, and turn to for meaning in times of devastatingly high levels of deaths.  This course focuses on the history, policy, management, and protection of vital records and vital statistics in the United States and will open students’ eyes to the surprisingly fascinating world of vital events.",Gretchen Van Wye,5:30pm,8:20pm,14567,,P6730-20253-001,Vital Records & Vital Sta,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P6730-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

SOSC P6775,Health Communication,"Health Communication has emerged as an important field of theory, research, and practice in the 21st century. As recognized by several public health and global health agendas, well-designed and implemented health communication interventions can have a positive impact on public health and health care outcomes, as well as health equity. This course will introduce students to the field of Health Communication theory and practice, and its key action areas. It will prepare them to design, implement and evaluate health communication interventions within a systematic, participatory, engaging, process-oriented, and multidisciplinary framework that aims at behavioral, social, and organizational results and ultimately, improved public health outcomes.
As health communication is grounded in many theories and principles (e.g., behavioral and social change, marketing, intergroup, sociology, anthropology, cultural-centered and positive deviance theory, mass media and new media theory, medical models, community organizing, social networks, etc.) that are also shared by other disciplines in the public health, health care, and community development fields, these theories will be briefly reviewed as part of session two in relation to their specific application to health communication theory and practice.

What’s equally important, though, is answering the classic question that’s bedeviled advocates for centuries: “What is to be done?” This course will help us sharpen our answers to that question through study of recent advocacy efforts around COVID-19; HIV/AIDS; climate change; reproductive rights; environmental justice/racism; mass incarceration and criminal justice reform (particularly in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement), and others. Along the way, we’ll also learn about enduring dilemmas scholars have identified that confront all health advocates. These include: the costs and benefits of working within (versus outside of) formal politics; framing rhetoric to reach wider audiences; the virtues and drawbacks of confrontational direct action; public apathy towards “health” issues; oppositional movements at complete odds with theirs; and more recently, the potential of social media.

This entails exploring perspectives from across the social sciences, with an emphasis on sociology, anthropology, and histroy, and somewhat more limited reference to work in psychology and political science. Drawing upon assigned readings, lectures, discussions and individual assignments, students will develop the capacity to identify the strengths and limitations of perspectives used to frame research and interventions related to sexuality. Although the substantive focus of this course is the theorization of sexuality, over the course of the semester we will address a more fundamental question in public health – namely, what shapes ‘health behaviors’? Developing a sophisticated conceptualization of why people engage in behaviors that have detrimental health consequences, or conversely why they fail to take health-enhancing actions, lays the foundation for effective health promotion policies and programs. Because a great deal of sexual health promotion programming draws implicitly on behavioral science and interpersonal-level determinants of health practices, a goal of this course is to counter-balance that through an emphasis on the broader structural and institutional determinants of sexual practices.",Jessie Ford,4:00pm,6:50pm,14574,,P8736-20253-001,THEOR & PERSP ON SEXUALTY,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P8736-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

SOSC P8750,Race and Health,"Over the 17 years that I have taught this course, I have tried to present students with articles that would provide an exposure to the growing body of research, commentaries, and critiques that discuss the relationships between race, ethnicity, and health. The premise upon which our work is based is rather simple: race is highly correlated with health status, but after many years of investigating this association, researchers are not entirely clear what this association means, nor are they clear how to use their research to improve the lot of people of color who are at risk for a wide variety of health conditions. Put more precisely, we don’t know what it is about someone’s race that causes the excess morbidity and mortality that is observed among members of so many ethnic minority groups. Typically, in the first class of the semester, students find this to be a puzzling way of defining the key issues in race and health. Given the dynamics of last year’s presidential elections where race played a huge role, it seems all the more bizarre to suggest that race is a concept of limited value to the science of public health. To students born in this country or who have lived here for an extended period of time, nothing could be more obvious than the fact that race matters. Racism is a fact of American life, and that its victims should suffer poorer health status than mainstream Americans seems almost self-evident. As the semester progresses and as the critique of current health research about race becomes more pronounced in the readings, students of all races, I hasten to add often feel compelled to say: “I don’t care what the articles say, race MATTERS!!!!!” Agreed. Race does matter, and it often matters in ways that are intensely personal, painful, and gut-wrenching. But the point of this course is not to deny the student’s personal experience of race, but rather to ask you to look beyond such experiences to develop a science of public health that specifies how and in what way race “acts” to cause the excess morbidity and mortality we observe in so many communities of color.",Robert E Fullilove,1:00pm,3:50pm,14576,,P8750-20253-001,RACE AND HEALTH,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P8750-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

We will begin by examining the issues related to literacy in the US and transition to the concept of health literacy. We will discuss issues related to reading comprehension, and usability of health related materials. The class will evaluate the major health literacy assessment instruments, learning how to administer these for different populations. We will focus on the role of language and culture as confounders to health literacy. Time will be spent assessing and then developing appropriate health materials for print, visual, auditory and internet venues.

SOSC P8788,Theoretical Foundations of Sociomedical,"Theoretical Foundations of Sociomedical Sciences is the first in a two-semester seminar series that is required for all doctoral students in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences.  This seminar will examine a number of the major theoretical traditions – and enduring problems – that undergird contemporary practice in the sociomedical sciences. The historical review in the fall – like the critical examination of current research projects in the spring – will be guided by the framing interests and signature emphases of the department: urban environs in transformation, social structures and axes of inequality, disparities in morbidity and mortality, agency and identity, social construction and production of health and disease, globalization and marginalization. The overall aim is to familiarize students with the relevant interpretive/analytic traditions, provide a rehearsal stage for testing out particular tools and frameworks in compare- and-contrast exercises, and build the theoretical foundations that will enable them to critically assess contemporary work in the field. Close reading, class discussion, and reflective writing will be the practical means we employ to get there.",Kim J Hopper,1:00pm,3:50pm,14580,,P8788-20253-001,THEOR FOUNDATIONS-SOCIOME,Sociomedical Sciences,SOSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SOSC/P8788-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"GSAS

While acquiring a panoramic and critical view on a major field, on its sources and studies, the seminar’s participants will be guided by the following topics: 1) the tight relationship between Iberian colonization and collecting, in the selection and circulation of the art pieces and natural species that will enter the space of the museum and its catalogues 2) the intertwining between art pieces and natural species coming from afar with those produced or generated locally; 3) the different actors implicated in the

SPAN GR6442,The Art of Lying: Deception in Modern &,"Plato banished poets from his 
Republic
 on the account of their being thrice removed from the truth. Accused of artfully and seductively lying, poets were deemed dangerous, confusing, and unfit to guarantee the stability of the polis and were consequently extricated from it. Since then, the relationship between art and truth has been a contentious one. Art is fiction and fiction, at least in common parlance, is opposed to fact, to things as they 
really are
. This historical kinship with lying has often justified accusations of art as being a frivolous, lighthearted discipline, detached from the real. It has also, however, equipped artists with a ‘license to lie’—a prerogative that they have used frequently to reclaim art’s position in the realm of the real, to reinstate the poet’s place in the polis.
  
This seminar will interrogate modern and contemporary artistic practices that have an act of deception at their core—
pieces
 that, for some people and for some time, succeed in obscuring their fictional origins and acquired truth status. We will couple case study analysis with discussion of theoretical works to explore questions such as: How do these practices structure and produce their lies? In what ways do their acts of deception posit a different understanding of the real?  How do these practices dialogue with and intervene in the philosophical debates that have explored the tensions between art and truth? What does it mean to lie after the ‘postmodern turn’? How do different definitions of the real affect the interpretation and effects of these works? What is the role of belief in understanding and assessing these practices?
  
Since we will mostly study Latin American works, we will also speculate about the possibilities of identifying the peculiarities of the region’s relation to deception, both inside and outside the boundaries of the art world.
  
The course will culminate with a symposium, open to the public, at which students will present their research. Presentations will be followed by discussion, and the symposium will include the participation of an artist and a scholar whose works explore some of the issues studied over the semester.",Jeronimo Duarte Riascos,1:00pm,3:00pm,12140,,G6442-20253-001,The Art of Lying,Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/G6442-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,M,20253SPAN6442G001,SEMINAR

This is an intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. * This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), or have a score of 450-625 on the Department’s placement exam, and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences—including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

SPAN UN2104,Intermediate Spanish II: Topics on Clima,"This is an intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level focused on climate discourse and environmental topics.

After SPAN UN2104, students can continue learning Spanish and its cultures in SPAN UN3300.
  
This transdisciplinary course blends together Spanish language/s, Hispanic cultures, and climate in the field of the broadly defined ‘Climate Humanities’. It examines how climate change is discursively framed in the media, literature, and other cultural productions in the Spanish-speaking world including the US. We will explore how it becomes reframed as it travels from the scientific sphere to the social spaces where public opinion is negotiated, and how those linguistic and textual strategies shape and are shaped by the political economy of climate debates, that is, by the specific geopolitical and social positions of the different stake-holders. The purpose of this course is, first, to explore the possibilities of a new space at the interface between language/sociolinguistics, cultural studies, and environmental discourse to raise awareness of the challenges faced when we position ourselves outside of our communities of scholarly practice. Secondly, the course aims at providing students with tools to perform a mediating role between specialized knowledge production in Spanish and the public. From a multiliteracies framework, we will offer a language and content-based course with spaces for discussion of key emerging issues related to environmental justice using a critical discourse methodology while we continue honing students’ skills in Spanish through climate-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar.",Francisca Aguilo Mora,11:40am,12:55pm,13349,,W2104-20253-001,Intermediate Spanish II,Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/W2104-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,"SPAN UN2101

The principal aim of SPAN UN2108 is to build upon and further develop the knowledge of Spanish that heritage learners bring to the classroom – from SPAN UN1108 and/or from family and neighborhood exposure to the language. This course cultivates intermediate-level formal speaking, listening, reading, and writing abilities.
  
Spanish heritage language courses at Columbia/Barnard focus on the development of communicative abilities and literacy from sociolinguistic and sociocultural approaches. Throughout the semester, students will be reviewing spelling patterns, building vocabulary, acquiring and effectively using learning strategies, and strengthening composition skills in Spanish.

By conceiving authoritarianism as a historically produced–and therefore historically changing–notion, we will travel across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries to examine how phenomena associated with different forms of political domination were understood in their time and how they are understood today. Nation-building processes, class and gender conflicts, cultural politics, and the examination of past and current political and social movements will be the center of our discussion. Several questions will be raised (and hopefully answered) along this journey: How can we understand the specificity of Spanish forms of authoritarianism in the Euro-Atlantic scenario? How can we explain the reappearance of extreme right-wing populisms? How have transnational forces influenced old and new authoritarian dynamics? To address these issues, we will read essays, short stories, graphic novels, as well as theoretical texts that offer varied approaches to history, aesthetics, and politics. The works by writers Juan Marsé, Sara Mesa, Isaac Rosa, Carmen Martín Gaite, film-makers like Edgar Neville, José Luis Sáenz de Heredia, Carlos Saura or philosophers such as Benjamin, Adorno, Schmitt, Villacañas or Rodríguez Palop will be some of the materials from which to study the cultural logics of Spanish authoritarianism in a Global Age.",Ana M Fernandez Cebrian,10:10am,11:25am,12135,,W3559-20253-001,INTERROG AUTHORITARIANISM,Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/W3559-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,MW,20253SPAN3559W001,LECTURE
SPAN UN3895,"Women, Creation, and Feminisms in Contem","At the crossroads of social media, social movements, and the arts, the present course offers a comprehensive genealogy of recent cultural interventions embodying the most pressing issues for feminisms in Spain today. For this endeavor, the syllabus is organized around three thematic axes: memory, bodies, and territories. By deploying an open consideration of arts, activism, and their creators, the case-studies here introduced unfold a polyphonic nature in both content and form. In this light, problematics such as ecology, technology, love, violence, healthcare, labor, or collective trauma will be navigated through the genres of performance, essay, poetry, graphic novel, photography, documentary, music, or the videoclip. These will shape the singularities of the later socio-political cycle in the country, distinguished by the internationalist expansion of feminisms; an interconnected and intersectional approach to social justice; the emergence of a globalized and domestic far-right; and the shifting of the institutional left. Such a background will nurture a series of feminist interventions claiming radical imaginaries in the favor of the 99%.",Miguel Angel Blanco Martinez,2:40pm,3:55pm,13790,,W3895-20253-001,"Women, Creation & Feminis",Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPAN,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPAN/W3895-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,TR,20253SPAN3895W001,LECTURE

It focuses on the application in the second language (SL) classroom of the pedagogical principles reviewed in the previous semester, with emphasis on methodological approaches and applied techniques.
  
Students will be directly mentored regarding the classroom treatment and presentation of grammatical, lexical, socio-cultural, and pragmatic aspects of the language in the SL classroom. From a communicative approach and beyond, they will also continue to engage with basic teaching techniques such as lesson planning, use of the target language, technology integration, task design, and the use of written and oral authentic materials. They will learn practically how to promote the development of students’ abilities for literacy and critical thinking. Finally, they will be carefully guided through the actual design and implementation of testing and assessment measures for the course they are teaching. In this seminar, we will also analyze real and potential case scenarios that will/may arise in the classroom and we will consider tactics to resolve problems that typically occur. Reflective teaching practices (teachers as learners of teaching, dynamics of classroom communication, the role of teachers’ beliefs about pedagogical practices) will be revisited and rethought.",Irene Alonso-Aparicio,1:00pm,3:00pm,12159,,G6002-20253-001,Second Language Teaching,Latin American and Iberian Cultures,SPPO,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SPPO/G6002-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,2,SPPO GR6001,F,20253SPPO6002G001,SEMINAR

SPRT PS5225,Sustainability in Sports: Theory and Pra,"The global sports industry is substantial, encompassing various aspects such as sporting events, merchandise, broadcasting, and more. In 2022, the industry's revenue amounted to nearly $487 billion. By 2027, the global sports market is expected to surpass $623 billion. However, the influence of sports extends far beyond the field. Fans are both dedicated and passionate supporters who contribute to the industry's success and have a massive following across continents. From local matches to international tournaments, fans engage through attendance, viewership, merchandise purchases, social media interactions, and so much more.
  
As the market continues to grow, the sports industry has made significant progress toward embracing sustainability practices. Brands are increasingly transparent about their sustainability efforts, businesses are looking to partner with sustainability-focused organizations that have reputable certifications and initiatives, real estate developers and investors are designing environmentally friendly facilities, and athletes and their fan bases are demanding climate action, just to name a few. Despite some progress, there's ample room for growth within emerging sustainability practices in sports. Continued innovation can lead to eco-friendly materials, sustainable event management, ensuring sustainability across supply chains, and greening stadiums, venues, and event infrastructure, which can further minimize resource consumption and pollution and contribute to a healthier planet.    
  
This course introduces the concept of sustainability and its relevance to the sports industry. It examines the environmental, social, and economic impacts of sports activities, events, and organizations and explores the strategies and practices that can enhance the sustainability performance of the sports sector. The course covers topics such as the definitions and dimensions of sustainability and how they relate to sports; the drivers and challenges of sustainability in sports (climate change, stakeholder expectations, governance, and innovation); frameworks and tools for assessing and reporting on sustainability in sports; best practices and case studies of sustainability in sports; and opportunities and benefits of sustainability in sports (fan engagement, athlete activism, business development, and social impact).

SPRT PS5320,SOCCER ANALYTICS,"This course will examine the data collection process, application, and management practices as it applies to soccer, specifically Major League Soccer and the National Women’s Soccer League. Using soccer as a platform to explore techniques, students will develop a working knowledge of the practical applications of analysis and models used to make management decisions within an organization and a professional league. With growing global connectivity, and access to data across various international leagues, the ability to embrace in-game analytics to improve team's performance, evaluate talent, develop in-game strategies, and more efficiently manage their roster in order to create financial value for their stakeholders has become an invaluable skill.
  
 In response to the sports industry turning more towards application of analytics and critical thinking skills, Soccer Analytics aims to develop students into managers who can make decisions, based on provided models, regarding both player and team valuations. Students should be able to demonstrate the capability to apply advanced critical thinking skills to sports business issues and have the ability to integrate objective analysis with subjective judgment in a way that adds value to decision processes.
  
 The class will be taught through a combination of lectures, class discussion, group presentations and guest speakers.  Each class will include a review of the reading assignments noted in the syllabus, and students are expected to be fully prepared.  Students are required to read assignments from the texts as well as additional sources provided by the professor.

SUMA K6120,"SUMA PS6120 Equity, Policy, and Sustaina","Public policy shapes how our environment, both natural and built, is managed and regulated. Policy not only creates the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks needed to support sustainability goals, but is also critical in establishing an equitable foundation that supports individual and collective change in pursuit of those goals.
  
This course will serve as an introduction to equity in sustainability policy: We will survey federal, state, and local policies and proposals to understand how we use policy to enhance urban resilience, mitigate environmental impacts, and also promote social and economic justice. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws from economics, sociology, urban studies, critical theory, and more, students will develop their capacities to read and interpret policy, enhance their understanding of current policy frameworks, and strengthen their ability to engage with emerging policy developments.
  
Building on contemporary efforts in public policy, we will use an equity lens to focus on the human dimension of sustainability. We will explore policy frameworks and dialogues that foster more equitable outcomes, increase engagement of people most impacted, and contribute to sustainability goals. As an entry point, the course will focus on policies related to climate adaptation and urban sustainability transitions, setting the stage for students to explore equity in urban resilience efforts and to examine intersections of race, class, and other social factors with access to resources.
  
The course will be discussion-based and center participatory activities (e.g., student-led discussions, paired analyses, team exercises) designed to encourage students to consider policy issues from multiple perspectives—including identifying disparities and assessing opportunities for increasing equity in the sustainability policy sector. The course will also invite scholars and practitioners to share expertise and experience from the field.

SUMA K6135,SUMA PS6135 Art & Sustainability,"Since the first Earth Day in 1970, artists have increasingly addressed ecological issues in their work. This trend has magnified greatly in the past two decades. Around the globe, artists are creating artwork that addresses the impact of loss of biodiversity, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, plastic pollution, and the fragility of our shared ecosystems. Their art raises awareness of the need to act collectively, suggesting frameworks for replacing anthropocentric and colonial approaches to nature, and amplifying the urgent need for environmental justice. In this pivotal moment of climate change, artists inspire by cultivating new narratives and giving form to the invisible or unimaginable, demonstrating how art can help awaken resolve and shape our next steps. They invite viewer participation and action, and suggest ways to make a difference. In the process, they expand our potential for empathy and agency.
  
The cultural sector has an important role to play in shifting attitudes that would lead to developing more sustainable and equitable global futures. Artists focus on both local and global environmental issues, expanding the field of climate change communication and at times offering out-of-the-box solutions. The artists covered in the course are cognizant of the need for systemic social change in order to achieve policy change. Blurring the boundaries between art and activism, many are working collaboratively across disciplines and with various communities to address both the physical and ethical dimensions of sustainability. Others work independently to provide new visions for the future.

It is a comprehensive introductory water resource class that all sustainable-minded professionals should have.  The topics and materials studied in the class strikes a balance for management, business, science, and technical specialists. 
  
The sustainability of water has become an increasingly critical issue, and over the coming decade, as awareness and resources go into addressing public health, economics, growing development, climate and weather changes, and aging infrastructure. Water resources are affected by changes not only in climate but also in population, economic growth, technological and scientific changes, and other socioeconomic factors.  In addition, they serve a dual purpose; water resources are critical to both human society and natural ecosystems. The objective of this course is to provide a fundamental understanding of key global water challenges and hydrological processes in the natural and built environment.  We will then use this understanding to explore aspects of sustainable strategies for integrated and climate-resilient water resources management.  We will explore the roles of humans as an integral part of the water cycle: how we use our water resources and how our actions help shape the water cycle.

SUMA PS4236,Reversing the Biodiversity Crisis,"Course Overview
  
Often described as “twin crises,” climate change and biodiversity loss are among the most urgent sustainability challenges to be addressed in our modern era. While much focus has rightfully been placed on climate change mitigation actions at local, regional, and global scales, biodiversity loss is less often addressed by governments, institutions, industries, and individuals as a critical piece of the sustainability puzzle. In 2021, COP 15, the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, received far less media attention than COP 26, the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change. Yet climate change and biodiversity loss are inextricably linked, and without biodiversity and the associated ecosystem services and biospheric resilience upon which human society relies, a sustainable world is not possible. Moreover, certain climate change mitigation actions can actually be to the detriment of biological diversity.
  
 
  
Unlike a traditional conservation biology course geared towards ecologists and biologists, this course will be taught through the lens of sustainability management, equipping sustainability managers with the knowledge and direction needed to begin integrating biodiversity conservation and restoration into their professions. This course will illuminate the critical importance of biodiversity to sustainability and human well-being, the science and politics behind the current biodiversity crisis, and proposals, policies, and actions for bending the curve of biodiversity loss to create more sustainable and equitable outcomes for both humans and the non-humans with which we share our planet.
  
 
  
Students who seek to deepen their understanding of ecological sustainability and address the biodiversity crisis through the lens of sustainability management are encouraged to take this course. This course is an on-campus (or Hy-Flex) elective offered during the Fall semester and fulfills 3 credits within the Physical Dimensions of Sustainability Management curriculum area in the Master of Science in Sustainability Management program.

The course poses this question to a dozen leading sustainability practitioners, who answer it by discussing management strategies that they use in their own work. Through these guest lectures, extensive class discussion, readings, and writing assignments, students identify and simulate applying practical ways for transforming how organizations and complex systems work. The practitioners, who work in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors and in a wide variety of organizations, make presentations in the first hour of the course. Students then have time to ask questions and speak informally with the guest practitioners, and will participate in an instructor-led class discussion, geared toward identifying management strategies, better understanding their application, and considering their effectiveness. By the end of the course, the students gain an understanding of management tools and strategies that they, themselves, would use to integrate sustainability in organizations.

SUMA PS5035,GHG EMISSIONS: MEASURING AND MINIMIZING,"Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are now at a record high, and the world’s scientific community agrees that continued unabated release of greenhouse gases will have catastrophic consequences. Many efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, both public and private, have been underway for decades, yet it is now clear that collectively these efforts are failing, and that far more concerted efforts are necessary. In December 2015, the world’s nations agreed in Paris to take actions to limit the future increase in global temperatures well below to 2°C, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. Achieving this goal will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors, both public and private. Critical to any attempt to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a clear, accurate understanding of the sources and levels of greenhouse gas emissions. This course will address all facets of greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting and will provide students with tangible skills needed to direct such efforts in the future.
  
Students in this course will gain hands-on experience designing and executing greenhouse gas emissions inventories for companies, financial institutions and governments employing all necessary skills including the identification of analysis boundaries,  data collection, calculation of emissions levels, and reporting of results. In-class workshops and exercises will complement papers and group assignments.

SUMA PS5199,The Sustainable Transportation Economy,"Course Overview
  
Transportation accounts for about 25% of global GHG emissions.  Significantly reducing emissions in this sector is fundamental for addressing climate change.  Historically, the technical and commercial tools for tackling emissions in this sector have lagged other sectors (for example, electricity production).  But over the last several years, this dynamic has changed and there is now unprecedented capital and brainpower focused on transportation decarbonization. The course focuses on capturing the key elements that will speed the scale-up to low- and no- carbon transportation (“sustainable transportation”) across the breadth of transportation sectors.  In doing so, this scale-up will create new industries and business models – and has the potential to benefit a wide group of people, including those who in the past have been disproportionally affected by poor air quality caused by existing transportation sources.  The course is designed for any student who wishes to understand these elements in a deeper way.
  
 
  
The course will explore the decarbonization opportunities and challenges across the various transportation sectors, including light duty, commercial fleets, public transportation, aviation, and marine sectors – as well as areas that cut across all sectors, such as battery adoption, the supply chain for materials, fueling/charging. and the impact of hydrogen.  Because the carbon content of propulsion fuels is dependent on other sectors (for example, the transition to renewable electricity), the course will examine the energy transition in transportation in the context of broader decarbonization trends.  In exploring each transportation sub-sector, the course will focus mainly from the commercial perspective, but will incorporate the external factors (e.g., innovation, policy, macro-factors) that affect commercial success.
  
 
  
The course is intended for anyone wishing to further their knowledge or their career in the areas of sustainable transportation – especially in areas related to electric transportation.  The course will rely on lectures and discussions, both led by the professor and guest lecturers.  There are no prerequisites for the course.  The course assignments will include a combination of problem sets, financial modeling, and case studies/written assignments.  No previous financial modeling experience is required; the professor and/or TA will provid",Scott Fisher,6:10pm,8:00pm,11339,,K5199-20253-001,The Sustainable Transport,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5199-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Professional Studies

SUMA PS5260,Digital Product Development for Sustaina,"In April 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that global efforts are unlikely to reduce carbon emissions in line with COP21 targets of 1.5o C above preindustrial levels.  This finding underscores the urgency around decarbonizing the economy and sustainably managing natural resources.  A so-called “big, hairy, audacious goal,” it requires that similarly ambitious solutions be implemented across countries and industries.
  
It is only by measuring resources that stakeholders can manage them and ensure that they are available in sufficient quantities for future generations. Web tools provide up-to-date analyses of aggregated data; distill complex issues into accessible visualizations; enable users to drill down to answer questions; offer insights into complicated and interdependent issues; and display changes in performance over time.  For example, Sustainable 1/S&P Global’s ESG Scores are valuable because they expose patterns in data related to environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities.
  
This elective course will introduce students to the digital product management role in the context of sustainability.  Students will get a strong understanding of what it means to be a product manager and its role in the organization.  The course will demonstrate how to define a product vision; identify a product strategy; create product roadmaps; design a customer experience; enable data-driven decisions; understand the development process; manage for results; and, by “leading through influence,” coordinate cross-functional teams of business analysts, developers, data providers, marketing, users, customers, senior management and other stakeholders.  The course is about product strategy and how to innovate and launch new products and features.  Students will be prepared for product management roles in companies; though many of those skills are applicable to entrepreneurship, the course is not geared toward start-ups or new ventures.",Teri Mendelsohn,6:10pm,8:00pm,11377,,K5260-20253-001,Digital Product Developme,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5260-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Professional Studies

Global environmental problems are real and urgent. Their resolution requires creative and responsible thought and action from many different disciplines. 
  
 
  
Sustainability practitioners must understand global environmental issues and their effects on what they are charged to do. At one level, this course will consider the massive challenge of the 21st century:  how to alleviate poverty on a global scale and maintain a high quality of life while staying within the bounds of an ecologically limited and fragile biosphere -- the essence of sustainable development.  From a more practical perspective, the course will provide students with an understanding of international environmental policy design and the resulting body of law in order to strengthen their ability to understand, interpret and react to future developments in the sustainability management arena.

SUMA PS5446,Sustainability Value Creation in Private,"This course provides an overview of the way sustainability (environmental, social and governance) factors are analyzed in private markets. It focuses on preparing students to implement their understanding of the financial and societal risks and opportunities within the investment making process. In private markets, limited partners (pension funds, endowments, high net-worth individuals) have pushed the sustainability imperative and social consciousness of private equity funds and asset managers by seeking greater clarity around how their money is invested in both a responsible and financially meaningful way. Alongside this trend, an evolving regulatory environment globally has propelled the need to systemize evaluation frameworks for stakeholders within investment functions and advisors who support them.Unlike public markets, sustainability information is harder to glean in private markets and requires a skilled extraction and evaluation process. During this course, we examine a traditional ESG due diligence process embedded within the wider investment lifecycle (sourcing, diligence, hold and exit) through the lens of changing geographic regulatory landscape in financial investing and the market leading frameworks that quantify ESG factors for evaluation. The course culminates with a deal due diligence process that mimics an investment committee (IC) comprised of private equity leaders that understand the commercial and purpose-driven viability of an investment.",Angela Jhanji,4:10pm,6:00pm,11381,,K5446-20253-001,Sustainability Value Crea,Sustainability Management,SUMA,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUMA/K5446-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Professional Studies

SUMA PS5470,CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR SUSTAINABILITY PROF,"Throughout history, societies have discovered resources, designed and developed them into textiles,
  
tools and structures, and bartered and exchanged these goods based on their respective values.
  
Economies emerged, driven by each society’s needs and limited by the resources and technology
  
available to them. Over the last two centuries, global development accelerated due in large part to the
  
overextraction and use of finite resources, whether for energy or materials, and supported by vast
  
technological advancements. However, this economic model did not account for the long-term impacts of
  
the disposal or depletion of these finite resources and instead, carried on unreservedly in a “take-make’-
  
waste” manner, otherwise known as a linear economy. Despite a more profound understanding of our
  
planet’s available resources, the environmental impact of disposal and depletion, and the technological
  
advancements of the last several decades, the economic heritage of the last two centuries persists today;
  
which begs the question: what alternatives are there to a linear economy?
  
The premise of this course is that through systems-thinking, interdisciplinary solutions for an alternative
  
economic future are available to us. By looking at resources’ potential, we can shape alternative methods
  
of procurement, design, application, and create new market demands that aim to keep materials,
  
products and components in rotation at their highest utility and value. This elective course will delve into
  
both the theory of a circular economy - which would be a state of complete systemic regeneration and
  
restoration as well as an optimized use of resources and zero waste - and the practical applications
  
required in order to achieve this economic model. Achieving perfect circularity represents potentially
  
transformative systemic change and requires a fundamental re-think of many of our current economic
  
structures, systems and processes.
  
This is a full-semester elective course which is designed to create awareness among sustainability
  
leaders that those structures, systems and processes which exist today are not those which will carry us

SUMA PS5700,Sustainability Ethics and Financial Capi,"The World Bank has estimated that the global cost of corruption is at least $2.6 trillion, or 5% of the global gross domestic product (GDP). Businesses and individuals pay over $1 trillion in bribes annually, which does not account for billions of dollars of both humanitarian and development aid that pass clandestinely from public to private hands, billions lost to tax evasion, and billions funneled to and from illegal trafficking. In addition, it does not account for billions enmeshed in conflicts of interest, ranging from campaign donations to regulatory loopholes and in general, “private gain from public office”. All such transactions occur in globally widespread arenas of corrupt practices. In this money-based environment, “what is just” in the distribution of programmatic goods and services needs continually to be determined, and depends upon whose participation will be allowed, counted and verified in decision processes. Some voices are heard, others are unheard, and the difference often depends upon the existing distribution of wealth, including the access wealth facilitates to these processes.
  
 
  
In this complex situation, which results significantly from unethical practices, the process and success of sustainability, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), depend upon the positive inroads and disruptions made by ethical practices. What are the features of these practices? What kinds of ethics are necessary and integral to the process and success of sustainability? Many new practical ethics, framed by scholars and practitioners since the 1980s, are promoted today by individuals and organizations, including national and international governmental organizations, civil society organizations (CSOs, also called NGOs), corporations, and even loosely structured grassroots movements. In what forms and at what levels of sustainability management are the new ethics to be adopted and pursued? This course seeks to identify, explain and consider such “sustainability ethics” and the ways in which sustainability managers can activate them, largely through issue-framing, agenda-setting, and policy, program and project design, inspection and review.

The course addresses both the ecology and economics of forests. Combining the study of these two disciplines is necessary to understand and develop management actions and solutions to deforestation.  The emphasis in integrating ecology and economics is going to be on learning tools and techniques for managing forests. The course accounts both for North American and forests in other countries, including tropical ones. Current typical conceptions of forests are somewhat paradoxical: forests are considered marginal in sustainability, and yet they connect with many issues of central concern such as biodiversity, climate change, household energy for the poor, homelands for indigenous people, water and human shelter, to name a few. More specifically, forests provide a fruitful line of inquiry into many environmental issues, such as the complex balances within ecosystems, global cycling of elements, such as carbon, the nature of sustainability, and interactions between economic development and the conservation of nature.  For example, we will study biodiversity in forests. Much biodiversity is found outside of forests, but our study will provide an understanding of the ecological dynamics involved with biodiversity, the possible management options, and its importance for human survival.

SUMA PS5888,Geographies of Environmental Justice and,"The origin of the American Environmental Justice Movement can be traced back to the emergence of the American
 Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and more specifically to the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. These historical
 moments set the stage for a movement that continues to grow with present challenges and widening of economic,
 health and environmental disparities between racial groups and socioeconomic groups. The environmental justice
 movement builds upon the philosophy and work of environmentalism, which focuses on humanity’s adverse impact
 upon the environment, entailing both human and non-human existence. However, environmental justice stresses the
 manner in which adversely impacting the environment in turn adversely impacts the population of that environment.
  
 At the heart of the environmental justice movement are the issues of racism and socioeconomic injustice.
 This course will examine the intersections of race, equity, and the environment – focusing on history and the
 growing role and impact of the environmental justice movement in shaping new sustainability discourses, ethics,
 policies, and plans for the twenty-first century. Environmental Justice embeds various disciplines into its analytical
 framework ranging from human geography and history to urban studies, economics, sociology, environmental
 science, public policy, community organizing, and more. Drawing from these disciplines, as well as from recent
 policies, advocacy, and regulations, students will develop a deeper understanding of equity, sustainability, social
 impact, and environmental justice in places and spaces across the nation.
  
 Building on the broadness of environmental justice and sustainability, this course will use the geography lens and
 frameworks, building on the concept that geography brings together the physical and human dimensions of the
 world in the study of people, places, and environments. Geography will set the stage for us to explore a variety of
 environmental justice topics and issues in different regions across the nation, from the Black Belt South to the Rust
 Belt to Cancer Alley, New Orleans, and Atlanta; then back to New York City and the metropolitan area, introducing

This course explores the development and implementation of environmental legislation and policy in New York City during the past two decades. It includes discussions about historical context, environmental policymaking considerations, political processes, outcomes, and the role of stakeholders such as advocates, business, industry, labor, government actors, and community. Students will gain broad knowledge of key legislation and policies related to sustainability, resiliency, energy, emissions, waste and the circular economy, transportation, water and air quality, and green space. Furthermore, students will consider how environmental justice and equity play a role in the development of legislation and policy, and assess best practices for providing equitable treatment and engaging all communities. While the focus of the class will be on New York City, students will also learn about environmental policies implemented in other jurisdictions.
  
Introduction to Environmental Law and Policy in New York City is available to students in the Graduate Program for Sustainability Management. It is designed to provide future sustainability practitioners and others with a fundamental understanding of how legislation and policy is made, what influences this development, and how legislation and policy seek to address climate change in New York City in urban environments like New York City.

SUMA PS6125,FASHION POLICY AND THE POLITICS OF GOVER,"The fashion industry is an ideal case study on how governments, citizens and international institutions attempt to limit the environmental and social impacts of complex consumer industries with global supply chains. Historically, apparel and textiles have been at the center of some of the most consequential government actions under liberal Western democracy, including the abolition of slavery and the passage of the first workplace safety and labor laws in the United States. In recent years, fashion has returned to the center of dynamic policy debates within the sustainability and social impact space.
  
 
  
The $2.5 trillion global fashion industry’s social and environmental impacts often evade regulation. Major brands leverage long and opaque supply chains for raw materials and cheap manufacturing costs with very little accountability. Private regulation and voluntary commitments have policed fashion for the better part of four decades, an approach that arguably has ended in failures to protect human and environmental rights. The industry’s lack of accountability has cost lives, including the notorious Rana Plaza building collapse in 2013 where 1,132 garment makers died, and now contributes to a sizable percentage of annual climate change. Profits have been pushed to the top of the supply chain while garment makers consistently toil for poverty wages, and the pollution and environmental degradation of fashion is a burden almost exclusively carried by low-and-middle income nations and communities of color that manufacture clothing and produce raw materials.
  
 
  
But the tide is turning. Governments are being asked to step in and regulate the fashion industry. Can effective fashion policies police international supply chains and achieve their intended aims? Might they unleash unintended consequences and in what ways? This course is an introduction to the fast-evolving space of modern environmental and labor policy as it intersects with fashion, and which seeks to incentivize more responsible business behavior in the realm of social, environmental and governance impacts.

SUMA PS6130,Navigating Global Sustainability: Corpor,"This course takes a dual-pronged approach to the importance of sustainability reporting: examining both the corporate perspective on preparing sustainability disclosures and the investor perspective on how these disclosures are used to inform capital allocation, risk assessment, and stewardship decisions. At a time when the sustainability reporting landscape—both voluntary and mandatory—is rapidly evolving, focusing on the investor perspective provides clarity. This approach helps students anchor their learning in what matters most for capital markets, enabling them to organize and lead sustainability reporting processes within their own organizations. The goal of this two-sided lens is to equip students with the skills to deliver decision-useful, transparent, and consistent sustainability information that aligns with the demands of today’s regulatory and investment environments.
  
In the first half of the course, students will explore the evolving landscape of sustainability frameworks and regulations. Key regulatory regimes—such as California’s SB 253 and SB 261, the EU’s CSRD, and the CSDDD and GRI, Sustainability Reports, ISSB —will serve as anchors for case discussions. These discussions will play a crucial role in helping students understand how to administer sustainability reporting as a strategic organizational function, and in emphasizing the organizational capacity and management practices needed to comply with these frameworks. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, manage, and implement the internal processes required to respond to mandatory and evolving ESG disclosure expectations.
  
The second half of the course will adopt the lens of the investor, exploring how ESG disclosures are integrated into decision-making across three asset classes: public equity, private equity/alternatives, and fixed income. Students will engage in structured modules for each asset class, assuming the role of institutional investors tasked with interpreting disclosures, engaging with companies, and making recommendations.

SUSC PS5010,"CLIMATE SCI FOR DEC MAK: MOD, ANL & AP","Both human and natural systems are growing more vulnerable to climate variability (e.g., the anomalous weather induced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, or the increase in hurricanes that occurs when ocean currents warm the Atlantic) and to human-induced climate change, which manifests itself primarily through increases in temperature, precipitation intensity, and sea level, but which can potentially affect all aspects of the global climate. This course will prepare you to estimate climate hazards in your field thereby accelerating the design and implementation of climate-smart, sustainable practices. Climate models are the primary tool for predicting global and regional climate variations, for assessing climate-related risks, and for guiding adaption to climate variability and change. Thus, a basic understanding of the strengths and limitations of such tools is necessary to decision makers and professionals in technical fields.
  
This course will provide a foundation in the dynamics of the physical climate system that underpin climate models and a full survey of what aspects of the climate system are well observed and understood and where quantitative uncertainties remain. Students will gain a fundamental understanding of the modeling design choices and approximations that distinguish Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-class climate models from weather forecasting models and that create a diversity of state-of-the-art climate models and climate projections.
  
This course will provide an overview of the ways in which climate model output and observations can be merged into statistical models to support applications such as seasonal and decadal projections of climate extremes, global and regional climate impacts, and decision-making. Students will develop the skills to visualize, analyze, validate, and interpret climate model output, calculate impact-relevant indices such as duration of heat waves, severity of droughts, or probability of inundation, and the strategies to characterize strengths and uncertainties in projections of future climate change using ensembles of climate models and different emission scenarios.",Yutian Wu,4:10pm,6:00pm,12336,,K5010-20253-001,MODELING ANALYSIS AND APPLS,Sustainability Science,SUSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUSC/K5010-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,W,20253SUSC5010K001,LECTURE
SUSC PS5040,SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FACE OF NATURAL DI,"Natural hazards, naturally occurring phenomena, which can lead to great damage and loss of life, pose a great challenge for the sustainability of communities around the world. This course aims to prepare students to tackle specific hazards relevant to their life and work by providing them the scientific background and knowledge of the environmental factors that combine to produce natural disasters. The course will also train students about the methods used to study certain aspects of natural hazards and strategies for assessing risk and preparing communities and businesses for natural disasters. The course will cover a range of natural hazards, including geological, hydro-meteorological, and biological. The course will emphasize the driving physical, chemical and biological processes controlling the various hazards, and the observation and modeling methods used by scientists to assess and monitor events. Many case examples, including hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that occurred in the last five years, will be given and analyzed for the characteristics of the event, the preparation, and the response.
  
By providing students with a solid understanding of past natural disasters, the course prepares them to think more critically about creating more resilient communities, which can resist catastrophic events. Students will be studying the underpinning scientific principles of natural disasters but will also learn specific strategies for planning, mitigation, and response. During the course, students will master cutting-edge tools and technologies that will prepare them to work in the complex and demanding field of disaster management. After completing the course, students will be able to understand past events, communicate risk, and make critical decision related to disaster and preparedness. In increasingly unpredictable times, there is a need for more resilient and connected communities, and this particular course will train students in both the knowledge and skills needed to lead and strengthen those communities and resilience efforts at scale.

SUSC PS5120,THE TECHNOLOGY OF RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Students are expected to have completed a year of high school physics and chemistry.  It would be best to have also taken college level physics and chemistry.
 
Renewable energy is generated from natural processes that are continuously replenished.  Aside from geothermal and tidal power, solar radiation is the ultimate source of renewable energy.  In order to have a sustainable environment and economy, CO2 emissions must be reduced (and eventually stopped).  This requires that the fossil fuel based technologies underlying our present electricity generation and transportation systems be replaced by renewable energy.  In addition, the transition to renewable technologies will move nations closer to energy independence and thereby reduce geopolitical tensions associated with energy trading. This course begins with a review of the basics of electricity generation and the heat engines that are the foundation of our current energy systems.  This course will emphasize the inherent inefficiency associated with the conversion of thermal energy to electrical and mechanical energy. The course then covers the most important technologies employed to generate renewable energy.  These are hydroelectric, wind, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, biomass/biofuel, tidal and wave power. The course ends with a description of energy storage technologies, energy markets and possible pathways to a renewable energy future.",Jonathan Hollander,6:10pm,8:00pm,12339,,K5120-20253-001,THE TECHNOLOGY OF RENEWAB,Sustainability Science,SUSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUSC/K5120-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,M,20253SUSC5120K001,LECTURE

SUSC PS5190,REMOTE SENSING FOR AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS,"Aquatic systems are critical for provisioning ecosystem services that have sustained human civilization as evidenced by the establishment of the earliest civilizations on banks of rivers or along a coast.  Apart from regulating climate, aquatic systems provide food and transportation services, fresh water lakes and reservoirs provide water for consumption and irrigation, and coastal systems offer recreational services.  But growing human population, especially along the coast, has endangered the quality of ecosystem services.  The primary finding of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was that 15 out 24 ecosystem services examined are being degraded or being used unsustainably (MEA 2005).  Monitoring the aquatic ecosystem and understanding how to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural variability is an essential aspect of sustainability science. This course will provide an introduction to the use of remote sensing techniques that can be used to study the aquatic environment. There are several space-based sensors that provide information relevant to sustainable management of aquatic resources.  Depending on the sensor, observations are made as frequently as every day and spatially covering the entire globe.  Understanding the spatial and temporal context around an issue can help discriminate between local and far field effects and time series of remote sensing data can be constructed to investigate causes and consequences of environmental events.  Thus knowledge of the basic science of remote sensing, understanding how to select the appropriate sensor to answer a question, where to find the data and how to analyze this data could be critical tools for anyone interested in oceanic, coastal, and freshwater resource management. The course will follow active learning techniques and will consist of a lecture to introduce concepts followed by a discussion and lab time for hands on activities to learn and use tools for analysis of remote sensing data.  After the introduction of the basic principles of remote sensing, a series of case studies will be used to explore concepts in sustainability such as water quality, nutrient loading and hypoxia, coral reefs.  Remote sensing tools that are used to investigate and address environmental questions such as the effects of shutting down a sewage treatment plant, mapping of suspended sediment concentrations will be demonstrated and used by the students.  Each case study will be briefly introduced at the end of the pre",Ajit Subramaniam,6:10pm,8:00pm,12410,,K5190-20253-001,REMOTE SENSING FOR AQUATI,Sustainability Science,SUSC,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/SUSC/K5190-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Professional Studies,3,,T,20253SUSC5190K001,LECTURE
SUSC PS5210,ENV SUST INDICATORS: CONSTRUCTION & USE,"This course will present students with the architecture, data, methods, and use cases of environmental indicators, from national-level indices to spatial indices. The course will draw on the instructor’s experience in developing environmental sustainability, vulnerability and risk indicators for the Yale/Columbia EPI as well as for a diverse range of clients including the Global Environmental Facility, UN Environment, and the US Agency for International Development. Guest lecturers will provide exposure to Lamont experience in monitoring the ecological and health impacts of environmental pollution and the use of environmental indicators in New York City government. Beyond lecture and discussion, classroom activities will include learning games, role play and case study methods.
  
 
  
The course will explore alternative framings of sustainability, vulnerability and performance, as well as design approaches and aggregation techniques for creating composite indicators (e.g., hierarchical approaches vs. data reduction methods such as principal components analysis). The course will examine data sources from both in-situ monitoring and satellite remote sensing, and issues with their evaluation and appropriateness for use cases and end users. In lab sessions, the students will use pre-packaged data and basic statistical packages to understand the factors that influence index and ranking results, and will construct their own simple comparative index for a thematic area and region or country of their choice. They will learn to critically assess existing indicators and indices, and to construct their own. In addition, students will assess the impacts of environmental performance in several developing and developed countries using available data (e.g., pollutant levels in soils and air in Beijing and NYC), and project future changes based on the trends they see in their assessments. The course will also examine theories that describe the role of scientific information in decision-making processes, and factors that influence the uptake of information in those processes. The course will present best practices for designing effective indicators that can drive policy decisions.

They are also critical pragmatic issues in implementation of any new policies. The relative strength of different stakeholders, and the tactics they deploy to pursue their goals can determine what actually happens “on the ground”. We will take a case study approach, looking at how specific socio-economic impacts of environmental change generate calls for social change, shift alignments, deepen stakeholder entrenchment, and influence sustainability policy.

THEA AT6803,SEMINAR IN STAGE MANAGEMENT III,"Musicals, especially those that have traditionally originated on Broadway, are complex pieces of machinery that are designed to produce a variety of energies in the theater. When taken collectively, those energies constitute the aesthetic of the experience. As with plays, stage managers are charged with coordinating all of a musical’s production elements. However, stage managers should also be able to view a musical from every angle; that is, read it intelligently and analyze it dramatically so they can accurately gauge their contribution to the overall aesthetic. This course seeks to provide stage managers with a customized template to do that: in other words, how to connect what’s on the page and the stage to their own standard methodologies, cue calling, and the CEO/COO perspective.

THEA AT8120,DIALECTS & ACCENTS,"This course continues the actor’s work of experiencing voice and text in a free body as a means to develop versatile and transformative speech.  Students will deepen and refine their knowledge of the phonemes of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), as well as the ability to categorize and utilize Lexical Sets in pursuit of a dialect/accent.  Students will demonstrate their ability to notate texts and transcribe dialects and accents into both IPA and practically apply the framework of the Four Pillars and the Voice Recipe.
  
The student will use these tools, supplemented by handouts, video & audio resources and independent research, to study several accents/dialects in class as well as at least one additional independently researched accent/dialect. The goal of the class is to expand upon the actor’s choices of speech and vocal expression and to acquaint her/him with the resources necessary to truthfully portray an individual utilizing a dialect/accent on stage or screen.
  
Students will develop their own unique process for learning accents and dialects
, as well as efficiently and effectively applying their progression to texts via a combination of practice sentences, scene work, conversation, improvisation, cold readings, and a prepared monologue.  Students will complete the course having created a personal, in-depth method for researching and performing a role in which an accent or dialect is required.
  
Students will do self-directed and supported research as part of their study.  They will consciously and intelligently assimilate this contextual research into their embodiment choices.  The final project is a presentation of their research and the sharing of a monologue that is ideally 
written in the student’s selected dialect or accent

URBS GU4100,URBAN REVOLUTION: THE CITY IN POLITICS,"Contemporary politics are fundamentally urban. The concentration of people, experiences, and resources in space creates a potentially explosive friction between competing aims and interests. At times, these tensions are expressed through consensual deliberation, at others through radical confrontation. As the conventional politics of representative democracy encounter new crises of legitimacy worldwide, the embodied politics of the city become even more important. This course explores the crucial role that cities play in challenging the uneven distribution of power and making claims on the redistribution of resources.
  
The course is organized into three units: spaces, practices, and institutions. Using urban theory and historical examples, each week critically examines a distinct way in which the city matters to politics. Each unit ends by asking students to deploy this material in analyzing a contemporary case study. At the end of the semester, students synthesize what they have learned into a manifesto that outlines a sustainable, responsible, and realistic program of urban social change.",Nick R Smith,4:10pm,6:00pm,00364,,W4100-20253-001,URB REVOLUTION:CITY IN PO,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/W4100-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

This course explores how social scientists use ethnography to analyze questions and dilemmas often associated with urban settings. We will combine close readings of ethnographies with field-based inquiry, including our own studies of urban public space. Through both our readings and our field exercises, we will focus on the methods at the heart of ethnography: observation and participant-observation.
  
As we read other scholars’ work, we will ask how the author uses ethnographic tools to explore issues that are suitable for intensive fieldwork. We will assess which kinds of research problems and theoretical perspectives are a good fit with ethnography and the roles that ethnography can play in transdisciplinary research projects. You will apply what you have learned about research to design your own pilot fieldwork. The ethnographies that we read together will examine intersections of housing, race, and class in urban communities. You are welcome to extend this focus to your own fieldwork, but it’s not required to do so.

And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools.

URBS UN3450,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY DVLP,"New York City is made up of more than 400 neighborhoods. The concept of neighborhoods in cities has had many meanings and understandings over time. Equally complex is the concept of community used to describe the people attached to or defined by neighborhood. While neighborhood can be interpreted as a spatial, social, political, racial, ethnic, or even, economic unit; community often refers to the group of stakeholders (i.e. residents, workers, investors) whose interests directly align with the conditions of their environment. Community development is “a process where these community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems” that result from the changing contexts in their neighborhoods. Using a variety of theories and approaches, residents organize themselves or work with community development practitioners on the ground to obtain safe, affordable housing, improve the public realm, build wealth, get heard politically, develop human capital, and connect to metropolitan labor and housing markets. To address the ever-changing contexts of neighborhoods, community development organizations are taking on new roles and adapting (in various cases) to larger forces within the city, region and nation such as disinvestment, reinvestment, increased cultural diversity, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and changes in federal policy.  For more than a century, city-dwellers—and especially New Yorkers—have been tackling these challenges. This course will examine both historic and contemporary community building and development efforts, paying special attention to approaches which were shaped by New York City. This urban center, often described as a “city of neighborhoods,” has long been a seedbed for community-based problem-solving inventions. The course will focus on the theories (why?), tools (how?), and actors (who?) within the field of community development practice and is organized around important sectors (housing, econom",Noah Allison,2:40pm,3:55pm,00245,,W3450-20253-001,NEIGHBORHOOD & COMMUNITY,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/W3450-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

With the veritable explosion of urban data alongside the continued proliferation of new tools for its consideration, this course allows students to develop specialized approaches to spatial analysis while introducing a series of common advanced techniques and nuanced methodological questions. Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.
  
Among others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.
  
The course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar. Seminar-style presentation and discussion will rely heavily on student participation and preparation to consider the variety of spatial methods available and their implications on urban research and intervention. Woven throughout the semester is the development of a self-driven research project, through which students will engage and compare the methodological advantages and disadvantages of several assumptions, approaches, analyses, and datasets.",Leah M Meisterlin,2:10pm,4:00pm,00248,,V3800-20253-001,ADVANCED GIS,Urban Studies @Barnard,URBS,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/URBS/V3800-20253-001/,To be announced,,"Barnard College

VIAR AV5500,"Intro to Moving Image: Video, Film & Art","Intro to Moving Image: Video, Film & Art is an introductory class on the production and editing of digital video. Designed as an intensive hands-on production/post-production workshop, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills in shooting, sound and editing will be emphasized. Assignments are developed to allow students to deepen their familiarity with the language of the moving image medium. Over the course of the term, the class will explore the language and syntax of the moving image, including fiction, documentary and experimental approaches. Importance will be placed on the decision making behind the production of a work; why it was conceived of, shot, and edited in a certain way. Class time will be divided between technical workshops, viewing and discussing films and videos by independent producers/artists and discussing and critiquing students projects. Readings will be assigned on technical, aesthetic and theoretical issues. Only one section offered per semester.

VIAR AV5502,Animation,"Unlike any other medium, animation provides unmatched suspicion of disbelief. Moreover, one can exercise one's imagination in digital space beyond material and physical limitations. Combining the two provides the permissive space to manifest our wildest reveries: utopias, dystopias, thought experiments, psi-fic scenarios, or dollhouses for amphibians.
  
In this course, students will receive a general survey on a range of methods in animation production. From the most traditional hand-drawn animation and cel animation to digital animation employing Photoshop, After Effects, and Blender (3D animation). Although this class can be technically involved; software mastery the end goal of the course is using these techniques to produce animations as a means of expression. These are only tools to help students form and realize their creative visions. Designed for both the digitally inclined and those who hate computers, students can try and then choose the method most agreeable to their temperament and ideas. They can also combine and mix different methods, maximizing creative freedom.
  
The course will introduce projects from animation history (early experimental animation, Disney, Soviet experimental animation, etc.) and contemporary art examples (Pierre Huyghe, Ian Chang, Wong Ping. etc.). However, the aim is to go beyond the Western art canon and expose students to other facets of culture. We will also study examples from popular culture (music videos) and Japanese anime (Hideaki Anno, Satoshi Kon, Masaaki Yuasa, etc.). One of the most essential responsibilities the students will take on is expanding our collective references by bringing in and presenting works that genuinely inspire and interest them.
  
Animation is an exceptionally permissive medium; it facilitates all of your prior skills and interests. Whether it is drawing, painting, music, poetry, fiction, or using a yoyo, there is a way for it to exist in animation. Students will be asked to keep a sketchbook for the duration of the semester. It will serve a landing pad for ideas and an anchor point to manage the project. The course will cover the entire production process, from idea development, concept design, character design, writing, storyboarding, foley, voice, music, editing, and final publication. Much of the class time will be dedicated to working, punctured by presentations, technical workshops, and critiques. At the end of the semester, students will have completed three shorts (30 seconds-2 minutes) and one fully developed pr",Yi Fan Jiang,10:00am,4:00pm,12688,,R5502-20253-001,,Visual Arts,VIAR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/R5502-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Schools of the Arts,3,,F,20253VIAR5502R001,WORKSHOP
VIAR AV5510,Archive Photography,"When millions of images are made every day, how can a photographer create an original body of work? This class proposes that parsing humanity’s existing shared archive of images is more relevant than generating new images. Following models such as Nepal Picture Library, Magnum Foundation, Drik/Majority World, and Arab Image Foundation, contemporary photography has remapped its practice around the reimagining and explanation, of the archival object. This class explores many archives–family albums, historical photographs, government records, fragile maps, musical albums, and flea market collectibles. We will use a series of lens-based technologies, starting from the flatbed scanner and Photoshop retouching and radiating outward. We will explore archive concerns, including consent, ownership, privacy, circulation, respect, and political impact. Students will explore display forms, including slide shows, zines, books, and exhibitions. There will be a strong complement of reading and writing in this class around the theory and practice of archives from the Western North and Global South.",Naeem Mohaiemen,1:00pm,3:30pm,12689,,R5510-20253-001,,Visual Arts,VIAR,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naeem_Mohaiemen,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/R5510-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,Schools of the Arts,3,,MW,20253VIAR5510R001,STUDIO

VIAR AV5860,ARTIST MENTORSHIP / VISITING ARTIST LECT,"This required Visual Arts core MFA curriculum course, comprising two parts, allows MFA students to deeply engage with and learn directly from a wide variety of working artists who visit the program each year.
  
Lecture Series
 The lecture component, taught by an adjunct faculty member with a background in art history and/or curatorial studies, consists of lectures and individual studio visits by visiting artists and critics over the course of the academic year. The series is programmed by a panel of graduate Visual Arts students under the professor's close guidance. Invitations are extended to artists whose practice reflects the interests, mediums, and working methods of MFA students and the program. Weekly readings assigned by the professor provide context for upcoming visitors. Other course assignments include researching and preparing introductions and discussion questions for each of the visitors. Undergraduate students enrolled in Visual Arts courses are encouraged to attend and graduate students in Columbia's Department of Art History are also invited. Following each class-period the conversation continues informally at a reception for the visitor. Studio visits with Visual Arts MFA students take place on or around the week of the artist or critic's lecture and are coordinated and assigned by lottery by the professor.
  
Artist Mentorship
 The Artist-Mentor component allows a close and focused relationship to form between a core group of ten to fifteen students and their mentor. Students are assigned two mentors who they meet with each semester in two separate one-week workshops. The content of each workshop varies according to the Mentors’ areas of expertise and the needs of the students. Mentor weeks can include individual critiques, group critiques, studio visits, visits to galleries, other artist's studios, museums, special site visits, readings, and writing workshops. Here are a few descriptions from recent mentors:
 • During Mentor Week we will individually and collectively examine our assumptions and notions about art. What shapes our needs and expectations as artists and the impact of what we do?
 • Our week will include visits to exhibition spaces to observe how the public engages the art. Throughout, we will consider art's ability to have real life consequences and the public's desire to personally engage with and experience art without mediation.

VIAR GR5202,Graduate Seminar in Printmaking and Rela,"The Graduate Seminar in Printmaking and Related Media is designed to create a space that is inclusive yet focused on printmaking. Class time is structured to support, adapt and reflect students' needs and goals as individual artists and as a community. The course will examine printmaking as a medium in an expanded field, investigating its constitutive materials, exhibition and installation practices, and its ethics in the 21st century. The seminar will focus on the specific relations between tools, ideas and meanings that arise when artists engage with print media in various incarnations and concepts including editioned prints, multiples, artist-books, other types of printed matter, alternate means of distribution, and strategies of duplication and repetition. The ultimate objective is to provide students with in-depth knowledge of the materials, tools, histories and theories that underlie specific printmaking practices. The seminar combines discussion of students' artwork and research with readings on ethics, performance, cinema, poetics, data, museum practices, politics, and public space as they relate to printmaking.
 
 While the Columbia Visual Arts Program is dedicated to maintaining an interdisciplinary learning environment where students are free to use and explore different mediums while also learning to look at and critically discuss artwork in any medium, we are equally committed to providing in-depth knowledge concerning the theories, histories, practices, tools and materials underlying these different disciplines. Each semester we offer one Graduate Seminar in a different discipline, or combination of disciplines, including moving image, new genres, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture. These Discipline Seminars are taught by full-time and adjunct faculty, eminent critics, historians, curators, theorists, writers, and artists. Each seminar focuses on specific relations between tools, ideas and meanings that arise when artists engage with a particular medium. The seminars combine discussions of readings and artworks with presentations of students' individual work and research.",Craig Zammiello,10:00am,1:00pm,12665,,R5202-20253-001,Grad Seminar in Printmaki,Visual Arts,VIAR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/R5202-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,F,20253VIAR5202R001,SEMINAR

This course will also prepare students for professional work preparing art for venues of that type. This class will be structured around studio work, with an emphasis on the development and production of a final site-specific project. In order to foster students’ growth and ongoing investigation into the nature of contemporary sculpture, the class will also be comprised of slide lectures, visits to local artists’ studios, and galleries, as well as various public art projects throughout the city. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from research to intensive studio work on a final project, often a proposal for a site-specific work in a non-traditional venue. Generally, the first half of each class session will be dedicated to lecture and discussion, while the second half will be dedicated to individual studio work and critique.",Rirkrit Tiravanija,10:00am,4:00pm,12635,,W4310-20253-001,,Visual Arts,VIAR,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rirkrit_Tiravanija,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/W4310-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Barnard College

Designed as an intensive hands-on production/post-production workshop, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills in shooting, sound and editing will be emphasized. Assignments are developed to allow students to deepen their familiarity with the language of the moving image medium. Over the course of the term, the class will explore the language and syntax of the moving image, including fiction, documentary and experimental approaches. Importance will be placed on the decision making behind the production of a work; why it was conceived of, shot, and edited in a certain way.

VIAR UN3502,Animation,"Unlike any other medium, animation provides unmatched suspicion of disbelief. Moreover, one can exercise one's imagination in digital space beyond material and physical limitations. Combining the two provides the permissive space to manifest our wildest reveries: utopias, dystopias, thought experiments, psi-fic scenarios, or dollhouses for amphibians.
  
In this course, students will receive a general survey on a range of methods in animation production. From the most traditional hand-drawn animation and cel animation to digital animation employing Photoshop, After Effects, and Blender (3D animation). Although this class can be technically involved; software mastery the end goal of the course is using these techniques to produce animations as a means of expression. These are only tools to help students form and realize their creative visions. Designed for both the digitally inclined and those who hate computers, students can try and then choose the method most agreeable to their temperament and ideas. They can also combine and mix different methods, maximizing creative freedom.
  
The course will introduce projects from animation history (early experimental animation, Disney, Soviet experimental animation, etc.) and contemporary art examples (Pierre Huyghe, Ian Chang, Wong Ping. etc.). However, the aim is to go beyond the Western art canon and expose students to other facets of culture. We will also study examples from popular culture (music videos) and Japanese anime (Hideaki Anno, Satoshi Kon, Masaaki Yuasa, etc.). One of the most essential responsibilities the students will take on is expanding our collective references by bringing in and presenting works that genuinely inspire and interest them.
  
Animation is an exceptionally permissive medium; it facilitates all of your prior skills and interests. Whether it is drawing, painting, music, poetry, fiction, or using a yoyo, there is a way for it to exist in animation. Students will be asked to keep a sketchbook for the duration of the semester. It will serve a landing pad for ideas and an anchor point to manage the project. The course will cover the entire production process, from idea development, concept design, character design, writing, storyboarding, foley, voice, music, editing, and final publication. Much of the class time will be dedicated to working, punctured by presentations, technical workshops, and critiques. At the end of the semester, students will have completed three shorts (30 seconds-2 minutes) and one fully developed pr",Yi Fan Jiang,10:00am,4:00pm,12760,,R3502-20253-001,,Visual Arts,VIAR,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/VIAR/R3502-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,"Columbia College

This course introduces students to key concepts and texts in environmental humanities, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies of race, gender, sexuality, capital, nation, and globalization. The course examines the conceptual foundations that support humanistic analyses of environmental issues, climate crisis, and the ethics of justice and care. In turn, this critical analysis can serve as the basis for responding to the urgency of calls for environmental action.
  
 
  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
  
Students will learn what difference humanistic studies make to understanding environmental issues and climate crisis. The course will prepare students to:
  
  
Identify humanistic methods and how they contribute to understanding the world;
  
Demonstrate critical approaches to reading and representing environments;
  
Engage ethical questions related to the environment; and
  
Apply concepts from the course to synthesize the student’s use of humanistic approaches to address urgent environmental questions.",Ashley Dawson,10:10am,11:25am,00060,,X1006-20253-001,Environmental Humanities,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X1006-20253-001/,To be announced,,,3,,MW,20253WMST1006X001,LECTURE

This introductory course for the Interdisciplinary Concentration or Minor in Race and Ethnicity (ICORE/MORE) as well as Majors/Minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is open to all students. We focus on the critical study of social difference as an interdisciplinary practice, using texts with diverse modes of argumentation and evidence to analyze social differences as fundamentally entangled and co-produced.

WMST BC3145,Environmental  Humanities in Action,"Some of the central questions in the study of environmental humanities focus on human action, its context, and its effects. Thus, one major contribution of the environmental humanities is to study and consider how we conceptualize action, relations (both between humans and environments and among humans), and even the meaning of human being. The environmental humanities places these conceptual questions in the context of value and values, as well as questions of how values are materialized in practice. This course considers all of these questions through the study both theories of action in the context of environmental humanities and research into existing projects that are informed by and can inform the study of environmental humanities.",Janet Jakobsen,12:10pm,2:00pm,00970,,X3145-20253-001,Environ  Humanities in Ac,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jakobsen,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/X3145-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253WMST3145X001,SEMINAR
WMST BC3504,GENDERED CONTROVERSIES,"Love and sex have long been studied as historical constructs influenced by social, political, and economic dimensions. This course aims to expand this discourse by incorporating the often-overlooked lens of technological mediation. Beginning with the premise that romantic love is deeply shaped by the affordances of the technology of the time, a critical awareness of technological mediation in romance –especially of digital technologies, i.e. online dating, social media, or cybersex— allows for a deeper understanding of how social categories such as gender, race, class, ability, or sexuality are technologically-mediated, thereby informing our societal and cultural perceptions of love, dating, and sex.

WMST GU4100,Modes of Living:  Feminist and Critical,"Connecting cultural and social issues to ethical questions, this course in feminist and critical interdisciplinary studies offers students the opportunity to consider the relationship between values and value in different modes of living. All too often in public discourse ethical values are invoked but not clearly articulated in terms of their meaning, parameters, and relation to each other. This research seminar investigates values through a semester-long consideration of a single overarching question. This version of the course focuses on the environmental humanities, but other instantiations may use this method to consider different issues. Here, the values commonly invoked in public discussions of the environment are considered in relation to each other, placed in larger analytic contexts, and applied. The final section of the course brings the study of values together with a study of major environmental issues, with a focus on inter-relations amongst those issues. The course uses these interdisciplinary and critical approaches that have become central to feminist ethics as the basis for students developing a major semester-long research project on a question of their own choosing.",Janet Jakobsen,2:10pm,4:00pm,00971,,W4100-20253-001,Feminist & Critical Appro,"Women's, Gender, Sexuality Studies @Barnard",WMST,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jakobsen,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W4100-20253-001/,To be announced,,,4,,W,20253WMST4100W001,SEMINAR

What are the methods, practices, and vision enacted and proposed by the colonized for undoing and radically transforming the determinate logics, instruments, and structures of colonialism as these persist in the present moment? We will consider how gender and sexuality as well as race – as technologies of social organization, codes of valuation, and modes of survival – shape colonialism and the struggles against it. We will inquire into their significance to projects of decolonization.

WMST UN3915,"GENDER, SEXUALITY & POWER IN TRANSNATION","This course considers formations of gender, sexuality, and power as they circulate transnationally, as well as transnational feminist and queer movements that have emerged to address contemporary gendered and sexual inequalities. Topics include political economy, global care chains, sexuality, sex work and trafficking, feminist and queer politics, and human rights. If it is a small world after all, how do forces of globalization shape and redefine the relationship between gender, sexuality, and powerful institutions like the state? And, if power swirls everywhere, how are transnational power dynamics reinscribed in gendered bodies? How is the body represented in discussions of nationalism and in the political economy of globalization? These questions will frame this course by highlighting how gender, sexuality, and power coalesce to impact the lives of individuals in various spaces including workplaces, the academy, the home, religious institutions, the government, and civil society, and human rights organizations. This course will enable us to think transnationally, historically, and dynamically, using gender and sexuality as lenses through which to critique relations of power and the ways that power informs our everyday lives and subjectivities.",Tara Gonsalves,2:10pm,4:00pm,10045,,W3915-20253-001,"GEND,SEX&POWER TRANSNATL",Women's and Gender Studies,WMST,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WMST/W3915-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,4,,W,20253WMST3915W001,SEMINAR

In this course we’ll expand our understanding of how writing is often the site of lingering, numinous, immaterial presences. We’ll begin with the tradition of 
the ghost story
— a literary device beloved by writers for centuries across many genres. Beyond the consideration of the supernatural, we’ll also investigate more abstract capacities in which texts—and writers (and sometimes editors!)—are inevitably possessed by an 
other
, a presence that lingers persistently, making itself known whether we welcome it or not. Memory and trauma are their own kinds of ghosts. Similarly, we’ll discover how traces of works by writers we admire, our teachers, even a specific text or image, can manifest as spectral forms inhabiting our work. We’ll address the complexities of those vestiges in terms of appropriation and originality—what Harold Bloom calls “the anxiety of influence.” Students will process and explore these ideas in both creative and analytical writings throughout the semester.

WRIT UN3037,BODY & WORD,"Our writing often appears primarily as a product of cognitive faculties, and we easily overlook the profound influence our bodies exert on our thoughts and, consequently, our writing. Our perception of language itself is tied to how we perceive our physical selves. We can understand our bodies materially, as intricate structures of bone, muscle, and cells, or kinesthetically, through movement, force, and tone, intertwined with a spectrum of sensations like pain and pleasure, which intersect with our psychological and emotional landscapes. Through a series of movement exercises, readings, and writing assignments, this seminar delves into the profound impact a deeper understanding of our bodies and their movement can have on our writing, and conversely, how writing can influence our bodily experiences. Using various artistic mediums such as dance, film, literature, and fine arts, we aim to enhance our ability to articulate and write the body's presence and movement through space and time.

WRIT UN3118,VOICES & VISIONS OF CHILDHOOD,"Childhood, in some sense, is a universally shared area of expertise: everyone alive was once a kid. At the same time, childhood remains a profound mystery. There’s so much we don’t remember! And the experiences we do retain—did we really understand them, then or now? Even the most ordinary moments of early life can acquire extraordinary significance: they are the touchstones and talismans that we use to make sense of the world, and our place within it. But why? And how?
  
As we read and write about childhood in this class, we will be asking questions fundamental to the art of fiction: where does a story begin? How is a character formed? Youth, like literature, is filled with symbols. Kids, like writers, are imaginative, metaphorical thinkers, prone to both flights of fancy and glimpses of the truth. The stories of our youth often follow a predictable, prescribed narrative—we are, after all, rarely the authors of our own upbringing—and yet there are a few phases of life with as many plot twists, climactic and often traumatic events that shape who we are. In this way, our line of inquiry in this course will be at once literary and personal. We will be reading and writing about a subject that is nothing short of profound: the origins of life.",Clare Sestanovich,10:10am,12:00pm,14135,,W3118-20253-001,VOICES & VISIONS OF CHILD,Writing,WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3118-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253WRIT3118W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3126,Animal Tales,"""We polish an animal mirror to look for ourselves.""
  
 -Donna Haraway
  
In the last several decades, Animal Studies has emerged as a robust interdisciplinary field that once again seeks to engage with “the question of the animal,” as Derrida puts it. In this course, we will look at works of cultural production that explore the myriad relationships between human and nonhuman animals. We will read stories that dissolve the barrier between the domestic and the wild. We will read stories about human-animal hybrids. We will read stories from an animal’s-eye-view, imagining the world as an animal might: as a worm digging through the dirt toward an imagined utopia, as an elephant seeking vengeance against poachers, as a cultivated monkey exhausted by the cruelty of human society.
  
As the popular post-humanist scholar Donna Haraway puts it: We polish an animal mirror to look at ourselves. What can animals teach us about ourselves, and more importantly, what can animals teach us about how to survive our own nature? In the midst of this sixth extinction, animals are disappearing at a rapid rate due to human activity. Will it still be possible to cohabit peacefully, ecologically, with one another? By imagining the private lives of animals and writing stories from their perspective, can we still intervene and cultivate the necessary cross-species connections that will carry us into a more just and entwined future?",Anelise I Chen,12:10pm,2:00pm,14136,,W3126-20253-001,,Writing,WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3126-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,R,20253WRIT3126W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3132,THE ECSTASY OF INFLUENCE,"What does it mean to be original? How do we differentiate plagiarism from pastiche, appropriation from homage? And how do we build on pre-existing traditions while simultaneously creating work that reflects our own unique experiences of the world?
  
In a 2007 essay for 
Harper
’
s
 magazine, Jonathan Lethem countered critic Harold Bloom’s theory of “the anxiety of influence” by proposing, instead, an “ecstasy of influence”; Lethem suggested that writers embrace rather than reject the unavoidable imprints of their literary forbearers. Beginning with Lethem’s essay—which, itself, is composed entirely of borrowed (or “sampled”) text—this class will consider the nature of literary influence, and its role in the development of voice.
  
Each week, students will read from pairings of older stories and novel excerpts with contemporary work that falls within the same artistic lineage. In doing so, we’ll track the movement of stylistic, structural, and thematic approaches to fiction across time, and think about the different ways that stories and novels can converse with one another. We will also consider the influence of other artistic mediums—music, visual art, film and television—on various texts. Students will then write their own original short pieces modeled after the readings. Just as musicians cover songs, we will “cover” texts,  adding our own interpretive imprints.",Adam Z Wilson,12:10pm,2:00pm,14137,,W3132-20253-001,Ecstasy of Influence,Writing,WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3132-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253WRIT3132W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3136,ART OF THE PARAGRAPH,"The paragraph is the organizational principal which defines all prose. In this class, we will examine the techniques by which paragraphs are developed, created, and shaped. 
  
Elements of composition will be analyzed in depth. Techniques discussed include: rhythm, cadence, movement (and the illusion of life), sentence and syntax, grammar as poetic intent, the taut relationship of tone and voice, the orchestration of suspense and action, openings and endings, the veneer of authority, tension, subtext, the delivery of information, and the element of surprise. 
  
Oh—and you can expect a heavy emphasis on self-editing. 
  
This is a practical class oriented around craft and technique for students who are serious about developing their sense of control. Each week we will focus on the micro in order to understand the broader act of creation.

WRIT UN3214,HYBRID NONFICTION FORMS,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. Creative nonfiction is a frustratingly vague term. How do we give it real literary meaning; examine its compositional aims and techniques, its achievements and especially its aspirations? This course will focus on works that we might call visionary - works that combine art forms, genres and styles in striking ways. Works in which image and text combine to create a third interactive language for the reader. Works still termed fiction history or journalism that join fact and fiction to interrogate their uses and implications. Certain memoirs that are deliberately anti-autobiographical, turning from personal narrative to the sounds, sight, impressions and ideas of the writers milieu. Certain essays that join personal reflection to arts and cultural criticism, drawing on research and imagination, the vernacular and the formal, even prose and poetry. The assemblage or collage that, created from notebook entries, lists, quotations, footnotes and indexes achieves its coherence through fragments and associations, found and original texts.",Margo L Jefferson,12:10pm,2:00pm,11873,,W3214-20253-001,,Writing,WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3214-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,T,20253WRIT3214W001,SEMINAR
WRIT UN3215,WRITING ABOUT ART,"Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Department approval NOT required. 
  
This course will introduce students to writing about visual art. We will take our models from art history and contemporary art discourse, and students will be prompted to write with and about current art exhibitions and events throughout the city. The modes of art writing we will encounter include: the practice of ekphrasis (poems which describe or derive their inspiration from a work of art); writers such as John Ashbery, Gary Indiana, Eileen Myles, and others who for periods of their life held positions as art critics while composing poetry and works of fiction; writers such as Etel Adnan, Susan Howe, and Renee Gladman who have produced literature and works of art in equal measure. We will also look at artists who have written essays and poetry throughout their careers such as Robert Smithson, Glenn Ligon, Gregg Bordowitz, Moyra Davey, and Hannah Black, and consider both the visual qualities of writing and the ways that visual artists have used writing in their work. Lastly, we will consider what it means to write through a “milieu” of visual artists, such as those associated with the New York School and Moscow Conceptualism. Throughout the course students will produce original works and complete a final writing project that enriches, complicates, and departs from their own interests and preoccupations.",Eliza B Callahan,10:10am,12:00pm,11865,,W3215-20253-001,,Writing,WRIT,,https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/subj/WRIT/W3215-20253-001/,To be announced,In-Person,,3,,W,20253WRIT3215W001,SEMINAR

WRIT UN3224,Writing the Sixties,"In this seminar, we will target nonfiction from the 1960s—the decade that saw an avalanche of new forms, new awareness, new freedoms, and new conflicts, as well as the beginnings of social movements and cultural preoccupations that continue to frame our lives, as writers and as citizens, in the 21st century: civil rights, feminism, environmentalism, LGBTQ rights, pop culture, and the rise of mass media. We will look back more than a half century to examine the development of modern criticism, memoir, reporting, and profile-writing, and the ways they entwine. Along the way, we will ask questions about these classic nonfiction forms: How do reporters, essayists, and critics make sense of the new? How do they create work as rich as the best novels and short stories? Can criticism rise to the level of art? What roles do voice, point-of-view, character, dialogue, and plot—the traditional elements of fiction—play? As we go, we will witness the unfolding of arguably the most transitional decade in American history—with such events as the Kennedy assassination, the Watts Riots, the Human Be In, and the Vietnam War, along with the rise of Pop art, rock ‘n’ roll, and a new era of moviemaking—as it was documented in real time by writers at

WRIT UN3233,"DISRUPTIVE BODIES, DISRUPTIVE TEXTS: TRA","Until the mid-twentieth century, philosophies of embodiment failed to think through the morphology of trans bodies and lives, leaving trans experience, in a sense, “un-worded” in the critical imagination.
 Disruptive Bodies, Disruptive Texts: Trans Imaginings 
will examine how trans creatives have responded to this silence, rethinking cis-centric theories of embodiment to unearth innovative “vocabulary” for those lives and bodies long erased from archives and linguistic intelligibilities. Indeed, even in its representations of silence and loss for trans experience, the archive demands a certain attention: What is held in the weight of silence? How do such silences, or rather “silencings,” inform trans embodiment? Is transness destined to forever see itself bound up in hauntings, in violence?
 
  
The US publishing industry favours trans narratives that operate within traditional memoir or political and activist nonfiction. Yet, transness, in its disruption of supposed bodily norms, powerfully destabilises essayistic conventions. What is trans nonfiction when its written for us and by us? How then do we define trans nonfiction? What is transness at the level of the sentence, the paragraph? What textures, dimensions, or discussions does it bring to nonfiction as form, genre, and critical discourse? 
Disruptive Bodies, Disruptive Texts: Trans Imaginings 
will explore transness not only as content but as syntax, as form. The course will consider those works of trans creation that remove cis-lenses for approaching, organising, and understanding trans experience and literature. Instead, we will consider how the trans body emerges as rich centre from which to rework ideas of embodiment and essay form. And from that centre we will disrupt.
  
Each week, students will receive a generative prompt (either to complete in class or after) specific to the themes and concerns of the relevant reading materials. These are opportunities to experiment as the work will not be workshopped or critiqued.
  
Twice during the semester, students will lead discussions on assigned books, craft essays, and criticism and theory.

Why are we so attracted to dybbuks, spirit possession, magic, and monsters in the twenty-first century? This course will focus on magic, monsters, dybbuks, demons, and golems in Yiddish literature and beyond, including film and popular culture. We will approach the supernatural motif from the perspective of gender, body, and performance studies, and will explore the questions of memory, trauma, and identity. The aim of the course is to encourage students to discuss and critically engage with the various texts and film adaptations listed on the syllabus in an attempt to answer the following questions: In what ways do these works explore, interrogate with, and reflect on human experience? What do they tell us about the powers of good and evil? How relevant are they in the twenty-first century?
